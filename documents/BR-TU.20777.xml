ABSTRACT 

 

 

This work aims the applicability of the Transient electromagnetic method at an arid and semi-

arid environmental condition in the Santiago Island – Cape Verde. Some seashore areas of 

this island show an increasing salt contamination of the groundwater. The main objective of 

present work is to relate this water-quality condition with parameters taken from the transient 

sounding’s data. 

 

In this context, transient soundings have been acquired from 2005 through 2009, at several 

chosen valleys near the sea, in a mean rate of one field campaign each year. 

 

The first phase of this work was the understanding of the geophysical method details, 

problems and applicability, as the chosen and acquired equipment was the first one to be 

permanently available to the Portuguese geosciences community. This first phase was also 

accomplished with field tests. 

 

Interpretation of the transient sounding’s data curves were done by application of 1-D 

inversion methods already developed and published, as also with quasi 2-D and quasi 3-D 

inversion algorithms, where applicability was feasible. This was the second phase. The 2-D 

and 3-D approximation results are satisfactory and promising; although a higher spatial 

sounding’s density should certainly allow for better results. 

 

At phase three, these results have been compared against the available lithologic, hydrologic 

and hydrochemical data, in the context of Santiago’s island settings. The analyses of these 

merged data showed that two distinct origins for the observed inland groundwater salinity are 

possible; seashore shallow mixing with contemporary seawater and mixing with a deep and 

older salty layer from up flow groundwater. Relations between the electric resistivity and the 

salt water content distribution were found for the surveyed areas. 

 

To this environment condition, the electromagnetic transient method proved to be a reliable 

and powerful technique. The groundwater quality can be accessed beyond the few available 

watershed points, which have an uneven distribution.

RESUMO 

 
 
Este trabalho tem como finalidade a aplicação do método de prospecção geofísica no 
domínio electromagnético, conhecido como Transiente, em regiões áridas e semi-áridas da 
ilha de Santiago – Cabo Verde. Algumas áreas costeiras desta ilha apresentam um aumento 
de salinidade na sua água subterrânea, que se vem agravando no tempo. O principal 
objectivo do presente trabalho é relacionar a condição de qualidade desta água subterrânea 
com os parâmetros adquiridos a partir dos dados das sondagens electromagnéticas 
transientes. 
 
Neste contexto, foram efectuadas sondagens electromagnéticas transientes entre os anos 
de 2005 e 2009, em alguns vales costeiros da ilha, à razão média de uma campanha de 
trabalho de campo por ano. 
 
A primeira fase deste trabalho foi a compreensão dos detalhes do método geofísico em 
causa, tal como a sua aplicabilidade e suas limitações, uma vez que este tipo de método e o 
equipamento escolhido foi o primeiro a estar permanentemente disponível para a 
comunidade portuguesa de geociências. Esta primeira fase foi também acompanhada com a 
realização de testes de campo. 
 
A Interpretação dos dados das sondagens transientes foi efectuada através da aplicação de 
métodos de inversão 1D já desenvolvidos e publicados, e também com algoritmos de 
inversão quasi-2D e quasi-3D, sempre que possível. Esta foi a segunda fase do trabalho. Os 
resultados das aproximações quasi-2D e quasi-3D são satisfatórios e promissores, embora 
se verifique que uma maior densidade especial de sondagens transientes trará e certamente 
permitirá melhores resultados. 
 
Na fase três, estes resultados foram comparados com os dados litológicos, hidrológicos e 
hidroquímicos disponíveis, no contexto das condições da ilha de Santiago. As análises 
conjuntas destes dados mostram que devem existir duas origens distintas para a salinidade 
observada nas águas subterrâneas das zonas costeiras; uma mistura com a água actual do 
mar nas zonas sub-superficiais perto do mar, e uma mistura com uma mais profunda e 
antiga água ascendente que atravessa uma camada com maior conteúdo salino. Foram 
estabelecidas relações entre a resistividade eléctrica e a distribuição de conteúdo salino da 
água para as regiões pesquisadas. 
 
Nestas condições ambientais, o presente método electromagnético transiente provou ser 
uma técnica fiável e de fácil aplicabilidade. A qualidade das águas subterrâneas pode assim 
ser inferida indirectamente, mesmo em áreas no qual não existam poços ou furos de 
captação com distribuição uniforme nos vales.

INTRODUCTION 

 

The worldwide available freshwater to human needs for direct consumption or for the many 

fundamentals human activities (agriculture, industry, etc.) are in a fast decline face to the 

growing population natural demands. By consequence of human activities, water’s quality is 

accordingly getting depleted, with very adverse effects over populations, ecosystems and 

economy. The knowledge and control of water quantity and quality is vital and fundamental 

to the planning and management of this priceless resource to Earth life and health. This is 

even more difficult to achieve when groundwater is concerned. To probe the quantity and 

especially the quality of groundwater, specific actions have to be made, and some 

background conditions are mandatory, other than a simple superficial water sampling for 

physical-chemical (or biological) analyses. The traditional direct method, i.e. in-situ 

measurement of water’s electric conductivity or water sampling is only possible if springs, 

wells and boreholes do exist in the field. Nevertheless, the information will be limited to those 

sampling spots. The number of these sampling places is for most of the situations very 

limited. To overcome this, indirect methods can be very useful, like the geophysical methods 

have prove since the beginning of last century. 

 

The present thesis deals with the applicability of one method, between many geophysical 

electromagnetic prospection methods, known as Transient Method to the characterization of 

groundwater reservoirs. It was applied to the particular problem of groundwater quality 

assessment at Santiago Island – Cape Verde Republic. The work was done under the scope 

of FCT project HYDROARID – “Evaluation of the hydrological potential and seawater 

intrusion monitoring at semi-arid regions, by a multidisciplinary approach. Application to the 

islands of Santiago and Maio (Cabo Verde)”, POCI/CTE/GEX/55399/2004. Briefly the thesis 

is organized in nine chapters, including this first one devoted to a general introduction. 

 

Chapter 2 describes the physical electromagnetic principles behind the transient 

electromagnetic method. The signal problems and special effects over it are also included, 

together with the equipment description at field work. 

 

Chapter 3 describes the transient electromagnetic modelling theory, with description and 

testing of the several different methods to invert measured data and obtain a useful physical 

model. 

 

Chapter 4 describes the field work test to the equipment used thereafter, with comparison to 

other geophysical data acquired with different methods over the same location. 

 

Chapter 5 describes the electrical/hydrogeological relationships that can be established 

between the transient electromagnetic modelled data and some useful hydrogeological 

parameters of groundwater quality. 

 

Chapter 6 includes the most important Santiago Island settings, with geological and 

climatological description, as also the most-recent hydrochemical and isotopic available data.

Chapter 7 describes the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) surveys at Santiago Island, 

as also the interpretation of data by several different methods, and its relation with the 

observed groundwater chemistry. Assessment to groundwater salinity is advanced.

electromagnetic repetition surveys.

TEM METHOD 

 

The purpose of this second chapter is to give an introduction to the Transient 

Electromagnetic Method (TEM). The basic principles of the method, used equipment and 

sources of errors will be also presented here. Special effects like Induced Polarization and 

Superparamagnetic effect are discussed also. 

 

 

2.1 – Electromagnetic methods 
 

Electromagnetic (EM) geophysical exploration method is one of the many tools now available 

and applied to obtain information about the subsurface of the Earth. There is an EM variety 

of techniques, survey methods, applications and interpretation procedures. All of them, 

however, involve the measurement of one or more electric and/or magnetic-field component 

by an EM Receiver, from some natural or man-made Controlled Source ElectroMagnetic 

(CSEM) energy source - the EM Transmitter. Examples of techniques using natural EM field 

propagation at the Earth are Magnetotelluric (MT) and Spontaneous Potential (SP). One 

classification of the several techniques is given at table 2.1. Table’s first entry, is the 

resistivity method, also known as direct current (DC). This fundamental and well establish 

EM method was the first one to be successfully applied to earth interior’s study, at the XX 

century. It is a subset of the EM methods, which arise when zero frequency (continuous 

current - DC) are applied by the transmitter. 

 

Electromagnetic methods are based and ruled by Maxwell’s laws. An alternating current EM 

source induces always a secondary current in conductive earth materials. These secondary 

currents then generate secondary magnetic fields. EM receivers measure this secondary 

field, and sometimes, also the primary (initial) source field. The relation between the primary 

and secondary fields is just the way earth reacts to the applied stimulus – “the transfer 

function of the Earth”. Proprieties of the earth’s interior are interpreted from these transfer 

functions, being electrical resistivity (or electrical conductivity, EC) one of the most-used 

propriety. 

 

The success and evolution of EM methods stand from the wide range of available targets, 

and the almost any scale applicability of it; starting from the small natural sample at the 

laboratory to regional and global distribution of anomalously conductive mantle. However the 

“driven force” behind the EM method was the mineral exploration surveys, because most 

base metal massive sulfides ores are very conductive, providing a strong contrast to their 

host rocks. This exploration began in the 1950-60 period, with the advent of airborne 

systems. For long time, it was the prime application of EM methods. In the last century 70’, 

the application of EM to other targets, besides traditional mineral exploration, together with a 

growing development of EM exploration equipment, gave the possibility to search, for 

instance, the conductive influx seawater into a resistive aquifer (Auken et al., 2006, Swift, 

1988).

Not included on Table 2.1 is the GPR (Ground-Penetrating Radar) technique. It is a relatively 

new tool, with typically a two twin antenna system, one being the EM Transmitter and the 

other one being the EM Receiver. The EM frequency ranges from 50 MHz to the 1-2 GHz, 

allowing a high resolution and detail at the near surface, with a small size and portable 

equipment. This EM technique output is similar to seismic method, and many working tools 

are just adapted from the latter. The major difference, to exclude GPR from Table 2.1, is the 

applied frequency domain. At these high frequencies, EM earth material’s behaviour is very 

different from the diffusive techniques included on Table 2.1.

2.2 – The TEM method 
 

Electromagnetic methods are divided into two categories: Frequency Domain methods 

(FDEM) and Time Domain methods (TDEM). Only this latter one will be described here. 

 



TEM METHOD 
_____________ 

 5

Transient Electromagnetic Method is a time-domain method which was originally designed in 

the seventies of last century, as a way of finding ore deposits, mainly sulfides. At Portugal, it 

was and still is applied throughout the Iberian pyritic main belt with that purpose. It is an 

inductive method, and its ability to find low-resistivity layers has also made it one of the 

preferred methods for locating the bottom of aquifers, in the last decades. Nowadays, it is 

becoming very popular for hydrogeological mapping, replacing the traditional DC resistivity 

method, to some extent, by its easy application and less man power, being cheaper than DC 

method. It is best suited to groundwater prospecting at arid and hard-rock environments. 

However there are some natural limitations, inherent to the method. For instance, according 

to Jørgensen et al. (2003), layers with resistivity higher than 80-120 ?.m cannot be expected 

to be mapped correctly if they are surrounded by layers with a lower resistivity value. 

 

At present, TEM is under continuous development, which has resulted in the development of 

systems like the airborne SkyTEM method, the continuous TEM method (PATEM) and the 

high moment TEM method (HMTEM or HiTEM). (Danielsen et al., 2001 and 2003). 

Reference texts and descriptions for geological exploration and environmental investigation 

problems; such as mineral, groundwater and geothermal explorations, engineering geology 

and applied environmental geophysics investigations can be found at (Fittermann and 

Stewart, 1986; Buselli et al., 1990; Hoekstra and Blohm, 1990; Nabighian and Macnae, 1991; 

Zhdanov and Keller, 1994; Christensen and Sorensen, 1998). 

 

As described the TEM is part of the Time Domain Electromagnetic Method geophysical 

prospection technique, contrary to the Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Method. Time 

Domain methods use a direct current, usually passed through an ungrounded loop laying 

down at earth’s surface. Applying a continuous current to a coil creates a magnetic field, 

which is stable after some time. Stopping this current originates a variable magnetic field, 

which intensity decreases rapidly. The changing magnetic field induces currents in the 

ground. 

 

Previous reviews of CSEM studies, including TEM method, for near-surface applications 

have been carried out by Nobes (1996) and Tezkan (1999). Tutorial articles specifically 

concerned with the CSEM method have been written by McNeill (1980 a, b) and West and 

Macnae (1991), while deeper theoretical treatments are available in the books by Grant and 

West (1965), Ward and Hohmann (1987), Wait (1982), Nabighian (1989) and Zhdanov and 

Keller (1994). Introduction level exploration textbooks such as Telford et al. (1990), Sharma 

(1997) and Kearey et al. (2002) provide just a brief overview of the CSEM method, along with 

some case studies. 

 

At figure 2.1, the nomenclature and basic principles behind this method are summarized. 

Depicted theoretical waveform is called square wave (blue line). Red line represents the real 

current signal in the transmitter loop. The EM transmitter repeats this on-time – off-time 

cycles for a few minutes, to grab and enhance the registered signal. Each cycle last typically 

a couple of seconds. 

 

After the initial continuous field has stabilized, the current is turned off very rapidly (thus the 

term transient EM) and this induces a primary magnetic field, which is proportional to the 



TEM METHOD 
_____________

effective area of the loop and the current amount. The current can be turned off in several 

ways, and for theoretical studies, the turn-off ramp can even be a true ‘step-off’ response 

(blue line at figure 2.1). Just after the current is turned off, eddy (ring smoke like) currents are 

instantly generated near the transmitting wire, as a reaction to maintain the magnetic field. 

With the passage of time these horizontal currents diffuse down and outward (figure 2.2). As 

a result of the finite electrical conductivity of the ground (and also nearby targets) these 

current’s decay with time. The decay of the currents induces a secondary magnetic field, 

which is only dependent on the electric conductivity of the ground (and nearby targets), and 

can be measured by an induction receiver coil or loop (McNeill, 1990). Ideally, the primary 

field is absent while measuring earth’s response. 

 

The data is usually recorded in time windows (often called time gates) with increasing 

interval time length. That improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at late times, were the 

signals are weak. This recording happens at the off-time part of the cycle, following the turn-

off instant (zero time for the time gates counting). The current direction’s shift due to the 

unwanted signal from power lines if the repetition frequency is chosen as a multiple of a sub 

harmonic of the usual 50 Hz (or 60 Hz) power line frequency. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.1 - The basic measuring principles of the TEM method, with theoretical current (blue line) and 

real current (red line) over time. This is for a central (in loop) system. The relative lengths of the 

turn-on ramp and the turn off-ramp are not to scale, (adapted from Christiansen (2003)). 

 

The common TEM system used in environmental studies consists of a transmitter and a 

receiver unit. The transmitter unit is usually a large square loop made of standard flexible 

electrical cable with a side length varying between 10-20 and 100-150 meters. The current 

signal applied to the transmitter loop can be high as 30 ampere, but typically is about a few 

ampere in a 50 m × 50 meter single-turn square loop transmitter. The receiver is usually a 

rigid multi-turn coil with a diameter between a half and one meter, with an effective area of 

around 40-50 m

. Alternatively, the same transmitter loop cable can also be used as the 

receiver loop, one of the configurations at figure 2.3. The receiver can be placed either inside

the transmitter (central-loop or in-loop configuration) or outside the transmitter (offset 

configuration). For most ground TEM systems, only the vertical component of the secondary 

field is measured in a central loop configuration, but in recent years steps have been taken to 

use other configurations, and with receiver coils, all three components of the field can be 

used to gain information about the conductivity of the underground. For airborne systems, an 

offset configuration is used, and all three components of the field are recorded.

2.3 – The Physics of the TEM method 
 

The following description is a short overview of the electromagnetic theory behind the TEM 

method. The applied notation is as follows: lowercase-letters concern to functions expressed 

over time domain, and upper case-letters to functions expressed in the frequency domain 

(Harrington 1961). Where possible, the presentation of the relevant equations is kept in the 

time domain, although some arguments require equations stated in the frequency domain. 

 

 

2.3.1 – Maxwell Equations and constitutive relations 
 

The physics behind all electromagnetic phenomena is contained in the Maxwell Equations, 

which are first-order linear differential equations. Those equations are uncoupled, but they 

can be coupled by empirical constitutive relations, which reduce the amount of basic vector 

field functions from five to just two. Maxwell Equations are empirical equations based on 

experimental data and observations, performed, for instance, by Faraday and Ampere (Ward 

and Hohmann, 1988). All known electromagnetic phenomena obey to these equations, 

described in the time domain as;

]. 

 

Maxwell’s equation (2.1c) is the Faraday’s Law, which states that a changing over time 

magnetic field generates an electric field. This electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic 

induced field. Equation (2.1d) is known as modified Ampere’s Law, which states that 

magnetic fields are perpendicular to the electrical current and that the total current is the sum 

of the conductive current and the displacement current. The remaining two equations are 

both the laws of Gauss, describing the electric displacement (2.1a) and magnetic induction 

(2.1b). The later states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. That means a 

solenoid geometry field and ultimately that magnetic mono-poles do not exist. The former 

equation states that the divergence of the displacement current is equal to the electric charge 

density.

The usual way to solve this boundary-value problem is by field vector functions conversion to 

the scalar potential functions must. 

 

These Maxwell’s Equations (2.1a to 2.1d), are coupled through the following constitutive 

relations, in the frequency-domain. They are; 

 

    ? ? ????,EEEE,rrrr,t,T,P,…?EEEE     (2.2a) 
 

    ? ? ????,HHHH,rrrr,t,T,P,…?HHHH     (2.2b) 
 

    ! ? "???,EEEE,rrrr,t,T,P,…?EEEE     (2.2c) 
 

where ??, ?? and "? are tensors describing, respectively, the dielectric permittivity, the magnetic 
permittivity and the electric conductivity, as a function of ? (angular frequency), E (electric 

field), r (position vector), t (time), T (temperature) and P (pressure), These tensors are 

complex (in the general case), meaning that phases of D and E, of H and B and of J and E 

are different (Ward and Hohmann, 1988). 

 

Together with these two sets of expressions (2.1 and 2.2), the physic’s fundamental equation 

of charge conservation is always present: 

 

     
&amp;amp;'
&amp;amp;( 
 ? ) ? ? 0     (2.3) 

 

For homogeneous earth materials with electric conductivities equal or greater than 10

, 

free electric charge dissipates in less than 10
-6

 s (Stratton, 1941). Thus for the stand of view 

of geophysical prospecting, in which frequencies less than 10
5
 Hz are employed, the first 

term of the left-hand side of equation (2.3) vanish, remaining just: 

 

     ? ) ? ? 0     (2.4) 
 

This equation (2.4) does not hold true at inhomogeneous regions, for instance, at the 

interface between two different media a surface charge does accumulate. 

 

At most of the electromagnetic earth problems, and to simplify the analysis, a number of 

assumptions are made: 

 

- All media are considered linear, isotropic, homogeneous, and electrical properties 

are taken independent of time, temperature or pressure, 

- The magnetic permeability µ is assumed to be that of free space, µ = µ0 

(that couldn’t be the case over some eruptive formations). 

 

At some conditions, anisotropic media must be necessarily considered to aid in interpretation 

of observed data. At deep crustal surveys, temperature and pressure are also taken into 

account. Furthermore, in shallow geotechnical surveys, the time dependence of electric 

conductivity due to changes in soil moisture cannot always be neglected.

In the following considerations and derived relations, the simplification of the set of three 

expressions (2.2) in the time domain will suffice. The relations are restricted to non-

dispersive media where ?, µ and ? are time independent.

     , ? µµµµhhhh      (2.5b) 
 

     ? ? ????eeee      (2.5c) 
 

The last relation (2.5c) is the very well known Ohm’s law, connecting the prevailing 

conductive electric current to the applied electric field, over a conductive body. 

 

 

2.3.2 –The Electromagnetic Wave Equations 
 

The wave equations describe the wave properties of electric and magnetic fields as they 

travel across any conductive media. One arrive at the wave equation using the Maxwell 

equations (2.1) shows upon and taking the curl of each Faraday and Ampere equation and 

applying the constitutive relations (2.5). 

 

    ? ? ? ? /

    ? ? ? ? 1 ? 2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp;( ?? ? /? ? 3? ? /   (2.6b) 
 

It is assumed that the vector functions e and h are piecewise continuous and have continues 

first and second derivatives, allowing interchanging between  ? ?  and  ? ?
? . 
 

By use of Maxwell’s equations (2.1c) and (2.1d), and taking into account the known vector 

identity  ? ? ? ? 5 6 ?? ) 5 ? ?25 , and that for homogeneous regions we have ? ) / ? 8  and  
? ) 1 ? 8 , equations (2.6) turn out to be: 
 

    ?2/ ? 02 &amp;amp;9/&amp;amp;(9 ? 03 &amp;amp;/&amp;amp;( ? 0    (2.7a) 
 

    ?21 ? 02 &amp;amp;91&amp;amp;(9 ? 03 &amp;amp;1&amp;amp;( ? 0    (2.7b) 
 

These are the time-domain wave equations for the electric and magnetic fields. Physically 

(2.7) equation’s terms are as follows; the second term is the energy storage term, describing 

wave propagation (Powers, 1997). The third one is the energy dissipation term describing 

electromagnetic diffusion. As stated before, most CSEM methods operate at low frequencies 

(100 Hz to 1 MHz range), alternatively, slow time disturbances of the source current (?1 µs 
to 10 ms range). This condition leads that |03?/ ?
? | (|03?1 ?
? |) are larger by several 
orders of magnitude than |02?&lt;/ ?
&lt;? | (|02?&lt;1 ?
&lt;? |). It is then safe to ignore the wave 
propagation terms from (2.7) equations, and dielectric permittivity (?) play no further role in 

this discussion. But, if the electrical conductivity is low enough (like ? = 0.0001 S.m
-1
, electric 

resistivity of 10000 ?.m) and the angular frequency high enough (like ? = 2?×10

than ? ? ??, the electromagnetic response of the earth is fully described by Equations (2.7) 
with all terms kept. 

 

These simplifications are generally referred as the quasi-stationary approach and are best 

considered in the frequency-domain version of the wave equations. Applying Fourier 

Transformation to these wave equations, with respect to time leads to: 

 

     ?2= 
 ?02&gt;&amp;lt;? ?03&gt;?= ? 0    (2.8a) 
 

    ?2@ 
 ?02&gt;&amp;lt;? ?03&gt;?@ ? 0    (2.8b) 
with 

    A&amp;lt;? 02&gt;&amp;lt;? ?03&gt; ? ?B?D?    (2.9) 
 

where A is the wave number as defined by Ward and Hohmann (1988). The admittivity 
D? ? 3 
 ?2&gt; and the impedivity B? ? ?0&gt;  is such defined (Harrington, 1961). 
 

Equations (2.8) can be now rewritten as; 

 

     ?2= 
 A&lt;= ? 0     (2.10a) 
 

     ?2@ 
 A&lt;@ ? 0    (2.10b) 
 

Both sets of equations (2.8) and (2.10) are known as Helmholtz equations. The expression in 

the brackets (equations 2.8a and 2.8b) describes the differences between the electric 

displacement currents and the electric conducting currents. As stated, frequencies less than 

10
5
 Hz mean that conducting currents are much larger than the displacement currents, when 

real earth materials are considered. Once  02&gt;&amp;lt;E 03&gt; it is fulfilled, and expressions (2.8) 
do become: 

 

      ?2= ? ?03&gt;= ? 0    (2.11a) 
 

      ?2@ ? ?03&gt;@ ? 0    (2.11a) 
 
The equivalent equations set (2.7) in time domain, as stated before, thus becomes; 
 

     ?2/ ? 03 &amp;amp;/&amp;amp;( ? 0    (2.12a) 
 

     ?21 ? 03 &amp;amp;1&amp;amp;( ? 0    (2.12b) 
 

Under this circumstance, the wave number A simplifies to: 
 

     A ? F??03&gt;     (2.13) 
 

These equations set (2.11) and (2.12), represent diffusion equations (TEM is strictly a 

diffusive phenomenon method) that apply to real earth materials and lead to the attendant 

lack of resolution in EM prospecting methods (Ward and Hohmann, 1988).

2.3.3 – Boundary conditions 
 

The boundary conditions are important as they relate and rule out the behaviour of the 

electric and magnetic fields, when crossing in between regions of different electric and 

magnetic properties. They are stated as follows (Ward and Hohmann, 1988); 
 
Normal B: the normal component of the magnetic induction vector B is continuous over an 
interface between two regions (media 1 and 2) with different electrical properties. 
 

     ??G ? ?&lt;? ) H ? 0    (2.14) 
 
n is the unitary normal vector at boundary. 
 
Normal D: the normal component of the dielectric displacement vector D is discontinuous 
over an interface due to the accumulation of a surface charge density ?s. 

 

     ??G ? ?&lt;? ) H ? IJ    (2.15) 
 
Normal J: the normal component of the current density vector J is continuous over an 
interface. 
     ?!G ? !&lt;? ) H ? 0    (2.16) 
 
Tangential E: the tangential component of the electrical field vector E is continuous. 
 
     H ? ?=G ? =&lt;? ? 0    (2.17) 
 
Tangential H: the tangential component of the magnetic field vector H is continuous assuming 
that no surface currents exist at boundary. This is true for most non-metallic media. 
 
     H ? ?@G ? @&lt;? ? 0    (2.18) 
 
 

2.3.4 – Wave equations derived solutions  
 

The wave equations are of second order, linear and homogenous differential equations. To 

solve them, two sets of basic solutions are considered (Ward and Hohmann, 1988). The first 

set describes the sinusoidal dependence while the second set describes the impulsive, 

electric and magnetic fields in a full-space. 

 

 
First set solution – assuming plane waves with a sinusoidal time dependence, e

    / ? /8KLMN?OPMQ(? 
 /8MLN?OPKQ(?   (2.19a) 
 

    1 ? 18KLMN?OPMQ(? 
 18MLN?OPKQ(?   (2.19b) 
 

/8K (18K) and /8M (18M) are the initial time amplitudes (t = 0 s) of the electric (magnetic) field 
propagating, in the positive and negative z-direction, respectively.

      A ? R ? ?S    (2.20) 
 

with ? and ? being identical quantities (as conductive currents dominate over displacement 

currents), defined as: 

 

     R ? S ? TUVQ&amp;lt;     (2.21) 
 

This implies that quasi-static case waves propagating, in the positive z-direction, are just 

reduced to: 
 

     / ? /8KLMNWPMXPKNQ(    (2.22a) 
 

     1 ? 18KLMNWPMXPKNQ(    (2.22b) 
 

Since ? is a real value, the e
??z

 factor decreases as z increases. This factor represents the 

attenuation of the electromagnetic wave. As a result, the electromagnetic wave amplitude is 

reduced by a factor of 1/e at a distance called the skin depth, ?: 

 

     Y ? T&amp;lt;UVQ Z 503.3T&amp;lt;^V    (2.23) 
 

The known skin depth expression put into evidence, that attenuation depends on both the 

frequency and the conductivity of the media. Relatively high conductivity and frequency result 

in a faster attenuation with respect to depth. 

 

 

Second set solution - is derived by inverse Fourier transformation of the positive part of 

equations set (2.19) (neglecting displacement currents). It describes the behaviour of 

impulsive electric and magnetic fields at the surface of a media (z = 0 m), i.e. a plane wave 

propagating in a whole space. It yields that:

whole space due to a 1D impulse in the field. As a function of time (figure 2.4a) the field 

exhibits a modest short peak followed by a long decreasing tail. As a function of space, it is 

also possible to follow the electric (magnetic) field at each given time (figure 2.4b).

For a given spatial position, it’s possible to get the time of maximum field intensity in (2.24), 

doing the time derivative and finding the corresponding extreme peak (tmax), which is given 

by: 

 

      
klm ? UVB2n     (2.25) 
 

At figure 2.4a) this intensity’s peak occur at 0.0209 ms time (z = 100 m). 

 

Similarly, setting the spatial derivative (with respect to z) of expressions (2.24), and 

extracting the maximum, result at:

where zmax is the penetration depth. 

 

At figure 2.4b) this intensity’s peak occur at z ? 57.7 m (t = 0.0209 ms). 

 

Having the penetration depth, it’s possible, by differentiating the expression (2.26) with 

respect to time, to know the travel velocity expression of that maximum peak (Vmax): 

 

     rklm ? o G&lt;UV(p

As seen from expression (2.26) the penetration depth is proportional to t
1/2

. This is similar to 

the skin depth described by expression (2.23), which is proportional to 1/?
1/2

. 

 

Maxwell’s equations are homogenous in the frequency domain and apply only to source-free 

regions, and can be rewritten as: 

 

     ? ? EEEE 
 B?@ ? 0    (2.28a) 
 
     ? ? HHHH? D?= ? 0    (2.28b) 
 

If the region contains a source, equations (2.28) must be replaced by the following, which 

takes into account the non-homogeneity that is introduced: 

 

     ? ? EEEE 
 B?@ ? ?!ks     (2.28c) 
 
     ? ? HHHH? D?= ? 
!ts    (2.28d) 
 

where !ks  and !ts are the magnetic and electric sources currents, respectively. 
 

According to Ward and Hohmann (1988), these equations can be solved for infinite 

homogenous regions, provided that !ks  and !ts can be described explicitly. If E and H are 
described in terms of potentials, i.e functions from which E and H may be solved by 

differentiation; the equations are more easily solved. To accomplish this, Schelkunoff A and 

F potentials are introduced. 

 

TEM methods use a magnetic source !ks , transmitting a transverse electric field to the 
surrounding mean. This simplifies the situation because only the Schelkunoff potential F is 

necessary to express Em and Hm.

When this short electric pulse is emitted in a TEM square or circular transmitter loop, the 

observed induction response at receiver coil or loop can be thus computed. The response of 

a square (rectangular) or circular loop (with the same area) are similar (Poddar, 1982). The 

calculation of the circular loop response solution is easier because the integration along the 

loop can be carried out analytically. 

 

 

2.3.5 – General solutions 
 

A vertical magnetic dipole is a good approximation of a circular (square) loop, and the F 

Schelkunoff potential can be written. Assuming a circular loop at a height of h over a half-

space earth surface, with a current intensity I and radius a, the F potential at a point P(x,y,z) 

is:

Assuming that magnetic permeability is that of free space, the reflection coefficient, obtained 

by recursion from the bottom layer of the model, can be written like (Ward and Hohmann, 

1988):

If measurements are taken at the center of a horizontal loop, the response can be found by 

just setting ? equal to zero. Furthermore, if the measurements are made at the surface of a 

homogeneous earth, under the quasi-static approximation (valid when distances are much 

less than a wavelength in free space), equation (2.35) becomes (Ward and Hohmann, 1988):

and the magnetic-field intensity decays with a time dependency like t

, while the magnetic 

field’s time derivative decays with a time dependency of t

almost constant beyond 0.01 ms time (10 µs) (figure 2.7 example). Slope angular values are

The receiver in TDEM equipments is usually an induction-coil or loop sensor. So, it is 

therefore, better to handle with magnetic induction, b, instead of just work with magnetic-field 

intensity, h. This is easily accomplished, as the relation between these two fields is given by 

b = µ0 h.

2.4 – Application of the TEM method 
 

The TEM method, as previously derived, is sensitive to electrical conductivity averaged over 

the volume of ground in which induced electric currents are caused to flow. Among the 

surface applied geophysical methods that sense bulk electrical properties of the subsurface 

of the earth, this CSEM offers deeper penetration capability than GPR techniques and 

greater resolving power than DC resistivity methods. The method performs substantially 

better in conductive soils or high radar reflectivity zones where GPR often encounters 

difficulties. As mention before, TEM also performs well in highly resistive terrains where it’s 

difficult to establishing a good electrode contact with the ground, as required for most DC 

methods (Everett and Meju, 2005). 

 

Nowadays, it’s easy to operate TEM equipment at the field, with the available generation of 

commercial inexpensive instruments. The output power signal can reach several hundred 

watt, with the applied electric current from 1 A to several tens of ampere, allowing loop’s 

diameters to the hundred meters level. However, most of the TEM data is extensively 

acquired with the central loop or coincident (single) loop configurations. That is because 

most of the developed have been made for those geometries (Morrison et al., 1969; Patra, 

1970; Lee and Lewis, 1974; Kaufman, 1979; Nabighian, 1979; Verma and Mallick, 1979; 

Spies and Raiche, 1980; Raiche and Spies, 1981; Hoversten and Morrison, 1982; Rai and 

Sarma, 1986; Newmann et al., 1987; Goldman and Fittermann, 1987; Smith and West, 1988,

1989; Buselli et al., 1990; Hoekstra and Blohm, 1990; Nabighian and Macnae, 1991; Karmis 

et al., 2003, Zhdanov, 2009), because of the computational intricacies and difficulties 

associated with the TEM response for arbitrary in-loop and offset-loop receiver locations. As 

a matter of fact, only a few analytical or semi-analytical TEM response expressions have 

been published yet for the arbitrary source receiver offsets at the surface of the 

homogeneous earth model (Singh et al., 2009). The problem arises due to the computational 

complexities resulting from the product of Bessel’s functions in frequency-domain 

expressions (Ward and Hohmann, 1988). 

 

The processing of field data can be done throughout a variety of available options, ranging 

from construction of apparent conductivity curves based on simple asymptotic derived 

formulas, for rapid subsurface evaluation, like expression (2.42), to 1-D, 2-D and a few 

advanced 3-D forward modelling and inversion, for more detailed analyses. 

 

 

2.4.1 – Transient diffusion distance 
 

To implement the derived equation’s theory, a typical transmitter current waveform with a 

“slow rise” to a steady-on value is applied to the transmitter loop (figure 2.1). That just 

induces a static magnetic field, the primary field. This contains no information about the 

earth, but is proportional to the magnetic moment, M, given by: 

 

     M ? ?¶·¸¹¹º     (2.43) 
 

with n being the number of turns of the loop, Aloop the area of the loop [m
2
] and I the direct 

current intensity [A]. 

 

This steady current is followed by a rapid shut-off, as exemplified by the linear ramp decay at 

figure 2.1. This disturbance through the loop breaks the initial primary magnetic-field that 

begins to decay and generates a primary magnetic-field that is in-phase with, or proportional 

to the corresponding transmitter loop current. This current causes an electric-field to be 

induced and eddy currents to begin running in the ground near the coil, (figure 2.2). Due to 

ohmic loss by heat dissipation at the medium, these currents will soon begin to decay, 

thereby inducing a secondary magnetic field. This secondary magnetic is weak, and 

produced in proportion to the waning strength of those eddy currents. Immediately, after the 

current had been turned off, the strength of the secondary and primary fields are of the same 

order. Since the decay of these currents is a function of earth’s conductivity, the same 

happens with the secondary magnetic-field intensity. The decay of the secondary magnetic 

field induces an electromotive force in the receiver loop or coil that is measured trough time. 

Most TEM systems take voltage measurements during the transmitter off-time, when the 

primary field is already absent. The off-time measure’s advantage is that the relatively too 

much weak secondary field signal is not swamped by the stronger primary field signal. 

 

This induction process at the earth subsurface is equivalent to the diffusion of the transmitter 

loop image into a conducting medium. The similarity of the equations governing 

electromagnetic induction and hydrodynamic vortex motion was first noticed by Helmholtz

(Everett and Meju, 2005). This has lead directly to the association of this current image with 

a “smoke ring”, but care must be taken as the latter is not “blown”, as usually thought, but 

instead moves by self-induction with a velocity (maximum value given by 2.27 equation) that 

is generated by the smoke ring’s own vorticity and described by the famous Biot-Savart law. 

An electromagnetic smoke ring dissipates in a conductive medium much as the strength of a 

hydrodynamic eddy is attenuated by the viscosity of its host fluid. The medium property that 

dissipates the electromagnetic smoke ring is the electrical conductivity. 

 

During the ramp-off, the induced current assumes the shape of the horizontal projection of 

the transmitter loop on the surface of the conducting earth. This “smoke ring current like”, 

advances and diffuses downward and outward through the ground and time, at an angle of 

approximately 30º with horizontal, while decrease in amplitude. Current always flows 

horizontally with no downward component. The sense of the circulating induced currents is 

such that the secondary magnetic field tends to maintain the total magnetic field at its original 

steady-on value prior to the transmitter ramp-off situation (Lenz law). Therefore, the induced 

currents flow in the same direction as the transmitter current, to compensate for transmitter 

current decrease. 

 

The penetration depth, Zd, at a given time t was already deduced at expression (2.26). This 

depth corresponds to the vertical location of the surface current maximum (Nabighian and 

Macnae, 1991) and is also known as diffusion length or diffusion depth. Often the diffusion 

distance is defined as: 

 

     d ? 2»¼½     (2.44) 
 

The maximum depth, to which measurements can be obtained, Zlast, is not only a function of 

the applied magnetic moment, but also of the noise level, Vnoise acquisition at the measuring 

coil or loop (Christensen, 1995): 

 

    ¼¸lJ( ? o&amp;lt;&lt;¾??p
G G¥? o ¿®ÀÁÂÃÄÅp

G ¾?
    (2.45) 

 

At this depth, the measurements are greatly noise influenced, and became unsatisfactory. 

According to Christensen (1995) a practical limit could be when the SNR (Signal to Noise 

Ratio) equals the unit. This distance corresponds to the tlast time, by the expression (2.25): 

 

    
¸lJ( ? µo®?p
? ¾? o ¿&lt;¥ÀÁÂÃÄÅp

&amp;lt;¾?
    (2.46) 

 

As already mentioned, the maximum penetration depth is a function of the applied magnetic 

moment. Equation (2.45) expresses that dependency, Zlast is proportional to M
1/5

. Thereby a 

dramatic increase in magnetic moment is always needed to increase the maximum 

penetration depth. 

 

The magnetic-field configuration, for a given time, is shown at figure 2.9, with the “smoke 

ring” current superimposed. A conductive homogeneous half-space is considered.

For each time, the vertical profile of current density is calculated from the electric field at the 

earth by Ohm’s law. That current density decays rapidly with depth at any given instant in 

time, as plotted at figure 2.10, for tree time instants. The corresponding equivalent 

penetration depth (skin depth) is also represented.

2.4.2 –Time stages in the diffusion process 
 

Previous expressions (2.40 to 2.42) have been derived upon the assumption of a small ?, 

(2.38a). That means a late time (or late stage) behaviour. Let’s take a characteristic 

geometric dimension of the loop, such as r, the distance between the center of the 

transmitter and receiver loops or the transmitter-receiver loop radius for a coincident (or 

single) one loop. The stages can be defined as (Nabighian and Macnae, 1991): 

 

- early time (early stage) for d E r 
- intermediate time (intermediate stage) for d ­ r 
- late time (late stage) for d Æ r 
 

For each of these stages, simple asymptotic formulas can be derived, and thus solely valid 

and applicable in that same range. Deduced expressions (2.40) to (2.42) are the asymptotic

ones when t ? ? , and consecutively ? ? 0, a late stage condition. That means greater 

distances from the loop. For t ? 0 , and consecutively ? ? ? , early stage asymptotic 

expression also exist:

and 

     ?² ­&amp;lt;l9Ê? o±,_±e p     (2.49) 
 

The early stage apparent resistivity expression (2.49) it’s then independent of time, t. At 

figure 2.11, the early and late stage apparent resistivity is plotted against time. It shows 

clearly that asymptotic approximation to apparent resistivity values are only valid at first 

beginning of early stage and to the end of late stage, diverging otherwise. To avoid 

miscalculations of the apparent resistivity, it is therefore necessary to use the exact formula, 

given by expression (2.39), especially at the stages not covered by asymptotic expressions. 

The differences are notorious when comparing the full and late asymptotic apparent 

resistivity (figure 2.12).

loop central measure (50 m radius) over a homogeneous 100 ?.m half-space earth.

Characteristics of early and late-stage TEM vertical magnetic-field can be thus summarized 

as follows. Receiver measures with a central coil or coincident (or single) loop. 

 

Early time: 

diffusion distance is much less than transmitter-receiver separation, 

diffusion current is concentrated near transmitter loop, 

measured voltage o±,_±e p is independent of time, 
measured voltage o±,_±e p is linearly proportional to ?. 

 

Intermediate time: 

complex behaviour, 

measured voltage o±,_±e p relationship to ? is changing. 
 

Late time: 

diffusion depth greater than transmitter-receiver separation, 

measured voltage o±,_±e p relationship is proportional do 1/ t5/2, 
measured voltage o±,_±e p relationship is proportional do 1/ ?3/2. 

 

In contrast to the incident EM plane wave response of a homogenous conductive half-space 

which yields equations that can be easily solved for the true resistivity (therefore, defining a 

unique apparent resistivity result, e.g., in magnetotellurics), the usual time-domain response 

equations do not allow a single to all-time apparent resistivity solution. Nevertheless, it is 

customary to use the derived asymptotic relations to define early time and/or late time 

formulations to calculate those two apparent resistivities. That is still assumed as first 

approach, especially with some acquisition field equipment used for deeper TEM soundings.

?a(t) and exact ?f(t) expressions (adapted from Barsukov et al. (2007)).

2.5 – TEM-FAST 48 equipment 
 

Transient electromagnetic data acquisition within this thesis framework was accomplished 

with the equipment from the Applied Electromagnetic Research Ltd. (AEMR). This 

electromagnetic prospecting tool it’s the TEM-FAST 48, a very small, compact and portable 

unit, easy to deploy and apply at field work, even under hard conditions (figure 2.13). It was 

developed and builds under the chosen strategy of being a "simple - fast - robust" system. 

The complete set, with a single main transmitter-receiver unit, cables and loop weights about 

5 kg. External gel power batteries can be used, adding a couple more kilograms to be carried 

at the field. 

Figure 2.13 – TEM FAST 48 set with main unit (103 mm × 27 mm × 310 mm), loop cables 

and small pocket personal computer, (original photography from AEMR). 

 

One of the most important features of any TEM equipment is the time duration of the self-

transient process. That process is only dependent on the transmitter-antenna-receiver 

system properties. Obviously, proper quality TEM signals measures, and results are feasible 

only within the time interval where that self-transient process of the system is missing. The 

shorter the self-transient process is, earlier are the time delays and measures becomes 

feasible, allowing also the minimum depth of study. 

 

2.5.1 – TEM-FAST 48 technical specifications 
 

The 48 at TEM-FAST 48’s name stand for the maximum allowed number of acquisition 

channels. Those 48 time gate channels range from 4,1 µs to 15,4 ms, spanning over four 

decades at the ratio of 12 channel/decade. This very short beginning time of 4,1 µs after

turn-off, offer one to get information about the first few meter’s depth, when using small loops 

(1-10 meter size). The following characteristics are described at TEM-FAST 48 own manual. 

The transmitter unit output current amplitude pulses can be selected as one or four ampere. 

This is the maximum current allowed values. At the 4 A option, this extreme value is not 

usually reached. The achieved output current is only limited by the loop load resistivity value. 

The resistive loop values spans from a few to 20 ohm, with typically less than 0.01 H 

inductance and around 3 nF capacity (1 A output). The time of turning off the current's pulse, 

with a square single loop and 1 A option, is less than 3 µs (25 m × 25 m side size loop), 8 µs 

(50 m × 50 m) and 20 µs (100 m × 100 m). The ratio pulse/pause output current “square 

wave” is of 3 to 1. This special sequence of unipolar rectangular current pulses, provides at 

registration of long slow processes in well conducting media the minimal dynamic error 

caused by imposing of transients from both fronts of current pulses in transmitting loop 

antenna. Transmitted current pulse form, both theoretical and real, is given at figure 2.14. 

Figure 2.14 – Applied rectangular current pulses form of TEM FAST 48 (adapted from AEMR, 2006). 

 

Real voltage and current output test measures at loop are also shown at figures 2.15 and 

2.16, respectively. Those figures express the known fact that, useful data it’s postponed to 

increased times with the loop size dimensions. It is also expected some distortion at the 

output signal, especially at the maximum current value of 4 A (as seen at figure 2.17), as the 

extreme output voltage of the transistor used in the unit is equal to about 850 V. This effect 

can distort the measured transient process at a time less than 6-7 µs (20 m × 20 m size 

loop), 15-20 µs (50 m × 50 m) and until 40 µs (100 m ×100 m).

The input voltage to power on the unit is done by the internal 12 V, 2 Ah battery. External 

power can be provided with a 12 or 24 V option, being the 24 V the best and maximum 

power unit choice.

The receiver frequency band is greater than four MHz, allowing a correct time signal 

measure starting from the µs level. The number of automatically registered delays (time 

gates) spans from 16 to 48. The complete description and definition of these time gates are 

given at table 2.2, table 2.3 and figure 2.18. The electromagnetic cultural noise suppression 

is implemented with the 50 Hz or 60 Hz option, and is greater than 60 dB. The internal noise 

measure is at the 1 µV level (rms), with a dynamic range of 10
7
 (10 V to 1 µV) or 140 dB. A 

10 times signal amplification can be turned on. That can be necessary when in loop 

configuration is used. Constructor reported overall systematic voltage errors are 1 %. This is 

done in the operational temperature range -20 °C to +65 °C, as the acquisition system 

provides stable results of measurements at sharp changes of temperature, up to 3 

°C/minute. The unit performs also auto-calibrating and testing, tracing a correctness of work 

of the device during measurements, even in case when the noise level at input of the 

receiver achieves 1 V to 2 V.

Measurements of transient decay signal voltage E(t) for some channels is schematically 

shown at figure 2.19. For each strobe at each consecutive channel, the signal is grabbed and 

stored, to be analog stacked on the next run. Thus, the transient is gated practically 

continuously without "dead zones". This is done by the internal algorithm known as DAS 

(multi-channel strobe system, integration and storage of the analog information). After 

termination of DAS processes, the output signals are digitized by the ADC (Analog-to-Digital 

Converter), transferred to the control block, and the integrators reset into initial condition. The 

number of strobe-pulses at the analog stacking phase is given at Table 2.3, for the several 

modes of the unit operations. ADC dynamic range is 16 bits, with smallest unit being 1 µV. 

The joint work DAS plus ADC provides measurement of sizes E(t)/I in the already described 

dynamic range of 1 µVA
-1
 to 10 VA

-1
. The dynamic range of the signals E(t)/I depends on the 

value of the input parameters “Time Range”.

This procedure is automatically repeated for several times, to a maximum number of 20 

stacks. Each stack corresponds to 13 complete work cycles of DAS algorithm system. At full 

stack and with all 48 channels, acquisition time of a single TEM sounding can last almost 10 

minutes. The collected and grabbed data is saved into a small pocket personal computer 

(iPAQ), linked to the TEM-FAST 48 unit. This piece of equipment runs the program (AEMR, 

2006) that supply and controls the main unit’s selective parameters. 

 

Stacking the measured signals not only enhances the SNR, but also outputs the associated 

error to each channel measure. Typically, the higher channels (that correspond to signal late 

stages) are always more noisy when compared to the early ones, as seen at figure 2.20.

2.6 – Transient signals noise origin 
 

The TEM method measures the magnetic flux in the induction coil or loop. For accurate, 

correct and reliable interpretation of the responses in terms of subsurface geology, it’s 

important to recognize the various electromagnetic noise sources that may be present in 

TEM responses. 

 

There are natural and “artificial” (man-made) sources of EM noise. Within these two kinds of 

sources it is also essential to differentiate between what is coherent and what is incoherent 

EM noise (figure 2.21). Incoherent noise is, by definition, temporally uncorrelated with the 

TEM transmitted source current. Coherent noise will significantly change the shape of the 

TEM data curve.

2.6.1 – EM incoherent noise 
 

The predominant environmental noise sources (called spherics) are caused by impulsive 

lightning discharges whose EM radiation can propagate over thousands of kilometres within 

the earth-ionosphere waveguide. The sources of this EM radiation are the lightning 

discharges occurring all over the world. The continuous thunderstorms at the equatorial and 



TEM METHOD

 32

tropical regions of the earth’s globe, like Brazil, Central Africa or Malaysia, are the major 

contributors to this random character noise. The labels “TEM” and “TM” under spherics 

designation, refer to different waveguide modes of propagation (Wait, 1962), whereas the 

shape of the background continuum within the spherics band is determined by the cut-off 

frequencies of this two modes (Porrat et al., 2001). Usually noise from spherics has a 

frequency above 1 Hz. The lower continuum below 1 Hz frequency is caused by large-scale 

geomagnetic pulsations that arise in the response to the solar wind interaction with Earth’s 

magnetosphere. The fluctuations in the Earth’s magnetic field due to the solar wind, Earth’s 

rotation and the magnetic field are large-scale ones, do not interfere significantly with the 

measurements since they contribute only to the low-frequency noise, below 1 Hz (Spies and 

Frischknecht, 1991). 

 

The transient measured data is always an averaging of the induced electromotive force in the 

receiver loop or coil within the time gate channels. TEM equipments usually have logarithmic 

gating, that means that gate’s length is proportional to delay time (table 2.2). When the 

environmental noise is “white” (i.e., stochastic through all frequencies), this logarithmic gating 

result in an effective noise decay of t
?1/2

. However, the surrounding noises are not a “white 

spectrum”, as seen at figure 2.22. At a local scale, we can have superimposed spectra of AM 

transmitters with high amplitudes at single frequencies around 200 kHz. At these conditions, 

averaging and stacking such monochromatic signal results in an effective noise decay of t
?1

 

(Effersø et al. 1999). This contribution will dominate at early times, whereas the stochastic 

noise will dominate at late time stages. That’s also the case with the superimposed spikes on 

the background continuum spectrum at figure 2.22, caused by the 50 Hz and 60 Hz (and 

harmonics) supply power lines and radio signals from very low frequency (VLF) transmitters, 

used primarily by the navy military communication. The near-surface VLF hydrogeophysical 

investigation method uses these emissions (around 15 kHz to 24 kHz) as a signal source 

(Newman et al., 2003) (table 2.1), but for the most part, these transmissions are rather a 

source of noise. These are considered cultural noise, and will be next described. Other types 

of incoherent noise can include electronic and thermal noise in the receiver amplifiers of the 

signal. 

 

 

2.6.2 – EM coherent noise 
 

Coherent noise, however, is much more problematic. This kind of noise is temporally 

correlated with the transmitted source current and can include transmitter or receiver loop 

misalignment (when other then single loop geometry is used) or instrumental drift. Also, 

geometrical errors are introduced if the transmitter-receiver single loop is not perfectly 

squared. These geometric errors may also be induced by topography, but even if the ground 

is not flat the smoke rings currents will soon begin to travel downwards as if it was 

(Nabighian and Macnae, 1991). These effects are reduced by careful experimental and data 

processing procedures. Other sources of coherent noise are induced currents in conductive 

structures not classified as the primary target of the hydrogeophysical investigation. The two 

major classes are geologic and cultural noise. 

 



TEM METHOD

Geological noise can be defined as the electromagnetic field generated by induced currents 

flowing in fine-scale geological heterogeneities that are too small, too numerous and 

complicated to be described in detail and hence accounted in the numerical simulations to by 

done (Everett and Weiss, 2002). That includes anisotropy, frequency-dependent 

conductivity, dipping layers and near-surface inhomogeneities. Layers are commonly 

assumed to be homogeneous and parallel to the surface, and because this is obviously not 

always the case, errors are introduced. Small inhomogeneities disturb more the early times 

measures than the late times one, due to the smaller earth volume covered by the 

measurements at early times. Electrical conductivity may even vary with direction, as it is 

seen in sedimentary rocks where it is typically higher parallel to bedding than perpendicular 

to bedding. This is the called anisotropy, and a measure of this is the anisotropy factor (Spies 

and Frischknecht, 1991): 

 

     ? ? F?Ë ???      (2.50) 
 

where ?L and ?T are the longitudinal and transverse conductivity, respectively. 

 

Furthermore, electrical conductivity is not always independent of frequency, giving rise to 

induced polarization (IP) effects. After currents are turned off in the transmitter loop, vortex 

currents are induced in the ground beneath it. After signal turn-off, ions in the pore space 

fluids will begin to move in the same direction as the created vortex currents, thereby 

creating an additional current, the polarization current. The result is a decreasing resistivity 

at early times. These ions will begin ”piling up” at places of low mobility, the ”charged state” 

(Flis et al., 1989). As the vortex currents begin to decay, these ions will move back into their 

original place, to the equilibrium position, but now at a much slower rate. This movement 

gives rise to a second polarization current, this time of opposite direction. Given a sufficiently 

polarizable earth, the polarization current may dominate the vortex current at late times, 

thereby possibly reversing the signal (Flis et al., 1989). The IP effect will be detailed further 

on this chapter. 

 

Cultural noise is man-made. Major contributors are the 50 Hz or 60 Hz human power-lines 

supply. Associated to this situation, we have transient signals from switching on and off 

electric equipment, especially at densely human populated areas. Cultural noise is also the 

electromagnetic field generated by currents induced in man-made electrical conductors such 

as buried pipes, tanks and drums, fences, pipelines and power lines scaffoldings, or other 

objects (Qian and Boerner, 1995). These electrical conductors must be, if possible, included 

in numerical simulations so that their distorting effects on the TEM response can be properly 

evaluated. VLF transmitters and AM radio signals can be and are filtered out by low pass 

filters. 

 

The action at all these objects creates a measurable secondary magnetic field if they are in 

the vicinity of the sounding. The time constants of direct induction in these features are 

usually negligible as a result of the relatively small cross-section, so the main contribution 

comes from the ability to channel currents induced in the surrounding media (Danielsen et 

al., 2003), (Spies and Frischknecht, 1991). Coupling noise with TEM loop can be either 

capacitive or galvanic in origin, as can be seen, respectively in figure 2.23 and 2.24.

Figure 2.24 – Sounding whit galvanic coupling noise (adapted from Danielsen et al. (2003)). 

 

The former situation happens when the conductor is isolated, i.e. there is no contact between 

this and the surrounding media. The earth plus the insulator conductor system, work as an L-

C-R electrical circuit, giving rise to a secondary magnetic field in the conductor. Capacitive 

couplings may be easily recognized as fluctuations in the TEM sounding curves. They are 

related to modern high-power lines, insulated underground cables and telephone cables 

(Danielsen et al., 2003), (Spies and Frischknecht, 1991). 

 

Galvanic coupling requires galvanic contact with the conductor. The current runs from the 

surrounding media into the electric conductor and back, so the system can be regarded as 

an L-R electrical circuit. Galvanic couplings result only in a change of shape (bump) in the 

sounding curve, making them difficult to recognize, although the resulting attained model 

often contains an anomalously high conductivity. They are related to metallic fences, power 

line’s earthed connection, pipes or old type power cables with a metallic protection shielding 

(Danielsen et al., 2003), (Spies and Frischknecht, 1991). 

 

The intensity effect of a coupling depends on the shape of the conductor and his distance to 

the transmitter-receiver loop, r. The shape of conductors may be three-dimensional (3D),

two-dimensional (2D) or elongated with ends (referred to as 2.5D). The response of a 3D 

conductor decays proportional to r

 while the response of 2.5D and 2D conductors decay 

proportional to r
4
 and r

2
, respectively. A safety distance of 100-200 m from those noisy 

sources is often suggested. The safety distance increases with increasing resistivity 

(Danielsen et al., 2003). 
 

Geological and cultural noise like capacitive and galvanic coupling cannot be filtered or 

stacked out of TEM data easily, because of the mutual induction between the causative 

structures and the host geology. 

 

 

2.7 – Induced Polarization and Superparamagnetic effects 
 

As earlier referred, sometimes the TEM measured signals can be affected by means of 

frequency dependence of dielectric permittivity (?), known as the induced polarization (IP) 

effect, i.e. a dispersive phenomenon. It can occur also that magnetic permittivity (µ) of some 

earth layer or body is not that of free space. When such situation takes place, we can have a 

sow called superparamagnetic effect (SPM). 

 

2.7.1 – Induced Polarization effect 
 

Induction polarization is a complex phenomenon controlled by many physical and 

physicochemical reactions associated with the current passage through earth rocks. The 

effect was initially observed and discovered at galvanic measurement’s data in the middle of 

last century, and it was thereafter systematically studied and incorporated into many 

geophysical researches (Antonov and Shein, 2008). This natural phenomenon was widely 

observed at various geological media, essentially due to the influence on results at practically 

all EM researches. There is a great and positive experience of the IP effect use in classical 

researches of mineral deposits with direct and quasi-direct current methods, to achieve 

petrophysical properties of rocks with it. The applicability of the effect still is not fulfilled from 

a "practical" point of view in induction EM. IP is considered as "noise" and the recipes to 

overcome with it are yet under developed, e.g., Pelton et al. (1983 and 1984), Oldenburg and 

Li (1994), Effersø (2000), Routh and Oldenburg (2001), El-Kaliouby (2001), Antonov and 

Shein (2008). 

 

Some relationships do exist to account for this dispersion effect on TEM data. Most of IP 

models came from a phenomenological approach implying boundary-value solutions of 

Maxwell’s equations, for frequency-dependent resistivity. The Cole-Cole expression is one of 

the commonly applied to account for this polarization effect (Cole and Cole, 1941), and is 

written as; 

 

    ??&gt;? ? ?¥ Ì1 ? ??1 ? GGK?ÎÏÐ?Ñ¤Ò   (2.51) 
 

where Ó is the chargeability (or polarizability) defined as ? ? 1 ? ??/?¥, the ?? is the high 
frequency (infinite) resistivity and ?¥ the low frequency (DC) resistivity, ? is the time constant 



TEM METHOD 
_____________ 

 36

of IP process (relaxation time), ? is the so-called "logarithmic speed" or "parameter c", 

describing the variation of phase with frequency. The concepts of high and low frequency is 

not strictly determined, as in TEM practice, ?¥ is the resistivity on a constant current, and the 
?? is the resistivity at frequency range of 50 kHz to 100 kHz (which is actually the really 
measured limiting research frequency for TEM-FAST48 equipment). 

 

The IP effect comes because, when a displacement occurs in a material, there is a 

displacement current represented by the charge’s movement from the rest positions to the 

displaced positions. This current persists for only a limited amount of time, lasting from the 

moment at which the charge is first caused to move by the applied electric field to the 

moment at which the elastic restoring force brings the motion of the charge to a virtual halt. 

Over this time span, both the electric conductivity (resistivity) and the dielectric permittivity of 

the medium will vary with frequency. One of the simpler frequency-dependent behaviours in 

those electrical properties is caused by electron’s resonance, which can be characterized by 

simple harmonic motion of an electron in its “orbit” when an oscillatory field is applied. That is 

given by (von Hippel, 1954a, b): 

 

     ?Ö ? ?? 
 ×ÄM×ØGKÏ9Ð9    (2.52) 
 

where the ?? is the high-frequency limit of dielectric constant, and ?Ù is the low-frequency 
limit, and ? is the time constant of electron resonance. The low frequency can be even zero 
(DC or “static”), ?¥. The dielectric value is ? ? ?Ö ? i?ÖÖ , with ?Ö and ?ÖÖ the real (storage part) 
and imaginary (loss part) of it (Cole and Cole, 1941). 

 

This behaviour is traditionally characterized by a plot in the complex plane (the Cole-Cole 

plot), shown in figure 2.25. On this plot, the imaginary response is considered to be the 

dielectric permittivity and the real response is considered to be the dielectric loss. The form 

of the plot is a semicircle centred on the horizontal axis. Each point along this semicircle 

represents a specific frequency, increasing from right to left. The intercepts of the circle on 

the dielectric permittivity axis occur at the values for dielectric permittivity at very high and 

very low frequencies, where the displacement has not yet started and where the 

displacement is complete, respectively.

permittivity in the complex plane. ?ÖÖ is plotted as positive (adapted from Zhdanov, 2009).

In this simple and ideal polarization mechanism, the real conduction term is then zero at 

extremely high and low frequencies, meaning that no conduction takes place. In real 

materials, there is always an independent conduction term. The complexity of physical law 

governing dispersion is far more than that for simple harmonic motion. It can be described by 

equation: 

 

     ? ? ?? 
 ×?M×ØGK?ÎÏÐ?q°Ú    (2.53) 
 

where R is a characteristic parameter of the material (0 Û R Ü 1) and ?¥ is the zero-frequency 
value of dielectric constant (Cole and Cole, 1942). This is the Debye dielectric relaxation 

expression; 

 

     ? ? ?? 
 ×?M×ØGKÎÏÐ     (2.54) 
 

with R ? 0, (expression (2.52) is the real part of present one).

     ? ? ?? 
 ×?M×Ø??GKÎÏÐ?Ú?Ý    (2.55) 
 

when the symmetry parameter S is equal to unit, (when the relaxation peaks are symmetric). 
 

In real materials, some electric conduction by free charge carriers takes place in addition to 

the displacement currents. Total conduction is the sum of these two components, one being 

by free charge carriers (which is largely independent of frequency) and the other one being 

by the displacement of bound charge carriers, which is strongly frequency dependent:

circular arc for high-frequency behaviour, with a transition to a rising straight line for low

frequency behaviour. The transition from the circular plot to the linear plot depends on the 

relative importance of displacement and conduction currents. With strong conduction 

currents, the linear portion of the plot becomes dominant. 

 

Expression (2.51) describes the frequency characteristics of "infinitesimal" media cells, and 

generally speaking, does not contain any restrictions to parameters included in it. From a 

physical point of view, the question on those restrictions is more complicated. That 

expression describes a passive electrical system with the distributed parameters, however, 

having a "zeroth volume", it is then possible to assume the system only consists of the 

distributed resistors R and capacitors C, because the inductance is connected to volumetric 

magnetic interactions of fields, i.e. it is a function of volume, which considered cell have not, 

by definition. The (2.51) expression describes the characteristic of a passive RC-circuit, 

according to the classical theory of electrical circuits, impedance or admittance, as the 

complex function of frequency ã ? ä 
 ?&gt; (has poles and zeros only at ä Û 0). The ???? 
function as the following restrictions; parameter c must be 0 Û c Ü 1 and ?¥ ??? æ 1 and |???? | is a monotonously decreasing function of frequency (these restrictions are practically 
all confirmed at laboratory and field experiments), (AEMR, 2006). 

 

For homogeneous half-space with dispersive conductivity, the reaction of media to step 

power off the magnetic field consists approximately of two added parts (AEMR, 2006), as 

stated before: 

 

     E?t?/I ? E¥

It is possible, this way, to consider induction and polarizing signals additive in near zone of 

TEM (at ?t µ¥R&lt;? Æ 1). However, as exact calculations for horizontal layered media shown, 
this conclusion is only valid when ?t µ¥R&lt;?  is grater then 20-30. At earlier stages, the close 
interaction of induction and polarization signals is observed, and the additive summation is 

inconvenient. Usually, for calculations of IP in TEM, a rather simple mode is used. The 

conductivity of each layer (in integration expressions of the TEM processes), is replaced to 

frequency dependent according to A ? ?eMÉ Ðq? ? eMÉ Ð9? ? ln ??G ?&lt;???  (TEM time constants 
values ?G Æ ?&amp;lt;depend on many factors and usually can be taken as ?G ? 1 s and ?&amp;lt;? 1 µs) 
then make Fourier and Hankel transformation. 

 

In many cases, the IP effect is adequately described by the well-known Cole-Cole dispersive 

resistivity relation (2.51). But in a series of cases, Cole-Cole is not sufficient to explain the 

materials frequency dependence. More empirical relations do exist, like the Classical 

Dielectric Dispersion, Special Dielectric Dispersion, Cole-Davidson Dispersion (King and 

Smith, 1981), (Pelton et al., 1983, 1984), all of them implemented at the TEM-FAST 48 

inversions sounding algorithms. 

Figure 2.27 – The IP effect responses from a two layered earth model. Cole-Cole dispersive 

relation is applied to layers, with assigned values (adapted from AEMR, 2006). 

 

The classical example of IP effect is shown in figure 2.27. It is the output of a 25 m coincident 

single square loop size, over a horizontal layered earth with a superficial resistivity of 30 

ohm.m and 5 m thick, over a 300 ohm.m half-space. Relaxation time is 100 µs, and c = 0.5. 

Three responses are given; a first one without any IP effect (? = 0%), a second with located 

polarizability at first layer (?1 = 2.5%) and a third one with polarizability at deep poorly 

conducting layer (?2 = 7.5%).  

 

Distortion from shallow first layer is very significant, in spite of the fact that the thickness is 

just 5 m, and polarizability is rather small, compared with third response, were the 

observable distortions are hardly appreciable. At this first layer IP effect response, the late 

stages of the process have a negative sign, the typical signature at these polarized 

environments.

Conclusions about the IP effect can be summarized as: 

 

- polarizing effect Eip(t) is proportional to time derivative from the transient characteristic of 

conductivity (~? ?
î3?
?ð? ), 
- at any values of parameter c (0 Û c Ü 1) the Eip(t) sign signal is opposite to E0(t), and 
monotonously decreases in time, 

- greatest speed of decrease at c = 1 (EÎè?t? ~  ?eMÉ Ð? ? and at 0 Û c Ü 1 is EÎè?t? ~ ??? t? ?òK&lt;, 
- at some polarization’s parameters, the measured signal E?t?/I ? E¥ 
 EÎè can change sign 
at least twice, 

- polarizing signal Eip is proportional to R
3
, while induction signal E0 is proportional to R

4
, 

- with single coincident loop, the ratio E0/Eip is increased proportionally to the perimeter of the 

receiving-transmitting antenna ~ R, 

- apparent resistivity curve ?(t) for different size of loop, have essentially different form, 

- sounding curves ?(t) and E(t), sharply change at rise of loop above the ground surface, 

- effect is minimal in the coincident loop configuration, 

- reduction of IP influence can be achieved by the increase of the loop size. The ratio of 

induction and polarizing signals is proportional to the size of the coincident antenna ~ R. 

 

The IP effects are frequently very hard diagnosed on the TEM data. Exceptions are cases 

when the very intense manifestations of the polarization, at low levels of induction processes, 

repeatedly invert the sign of the observable signals. Cases occur when all observable signals 

(single coincident loop) from 4 µs to 4-10 ms time has a negative sign. Much more often the 

polarizing process just distorts measured sounding curve, without sign inversion of data 

points. At interpretation in these cases, false poorly conducting horizons come to light 

(Barsukov et al., 2007). 

 

With TEM-FAST 48 equipment, investigations have shown that most adverse interpretative 

situations (in which IP effect takes place) arise with the following conditions (AEMR, 2006): 

 

- thin, well conducting horizon of subsurface clay deposits with electric resistivity smaller than 

20-40 ohm.m, over rather high resistive layer of rocks with 300-500 ohm.m. At polarization of 

first layer (? = 1 - 3%), late stages of transient will be IP deformed. 

- glaciers, permafrost rocks and superficial deposits intensively polluted with industrial 

wastes, (including petroleum pollution), 

- weathering cores in crystal rocks and fault zones. 

 

The IP effect popup also at resistivities above 100 ohm.m when a significant polarizability 

does exist (? &gt; 10%) and the time constant ??Îè? spans a very wide range (1-1000 µs). As a 
layer superficial effect, c is approximately unitary (EÎè?t?~ ? eMÉ Ð? ) and distortions are 
observed in a narrow range of times. "Deep" IP effect is characterized by a c value around 

1/3 to 1/2, and distorts all the late stages of the signal. With the presence of IP in superficial 

and deep horizons of section, two negative minimums on early and late times are observed 

simultaneously. 

 

It is important to emphasise that since IP effect is linked to the presence of polarisable 

bodies (or fluids), it can thus be used in prospecting, tracing and monitoring those targets.

2.7.2 – Antenna Polarization effect 
 

The antenna polarization effect (APE) has been detected in TEM data soundings by many 

researchers (Bishop and Reid, 2003). No explanation was given to this effect, until recently 

(Barsukov et al., 2003). In practice, the transient characteristics (or their time derivatives) 

often show a sign reversal (usually called “negative anomalies”), which is solely due to the 

frequency dependence of electric conductivity of rocks, as previously described. 

 

With some TEM sounding’s experimental data, discrepancies are often observed that do not 

fit theoretical models of polarizable media, and the negative anomaly’s value depends on the 

resistivity of the loop wire (antenna). These differences between the experiment and theory 

cannot be explained by horizontal inhomogeneities of the studied medium or imperfection of 

modelling technique (Bishop and Reid, 2003). 

 

Distributed antenna capacity and ever-persisting resistance in the devices employed in 

geological media showing frequency-dependent dielectric permeability – produces the APE. 

This effect manifests themselves at later stages of transient process and is detected as a 

slow time decaying process ~tM?¥,?M¥,÷? with phase opposite to the induction transient 
characteristic phase. APE depends on the dispersion parameters of the medium at a fixed 

current value; it is proportional to the squared resistivity value of the antenna (loop) wire, as 

the plotted example at figure 2.28. APE is detected both with coincident (single) loop and 

with all the offset (separated) antennas, and should be taken into account in the field data 

interpretation (Barsukov et al., 2003 and 2007).

2.7.3 – Superparamagnetic effects 
 

Superparamagnetic (SPM) effect was studied by many researchers since last century, 

starting with Néel’s pioneering work (Néel 1949), followed by many more, directly connected 

to EM soundings (Nagata 1961, Averyanov 1965, Lee 1981, Buselli 1982, Barsukov and 

Fainberg 2001, etc.). In some publications, SPM effect is also called by “effect of magnetic 

viscosity”. 

 

SPM effect in rocky material is connected with the processes of orientation/disorientation of 

the magnetic moments of very fine scale particles (10
-10

 m order size) of magnetic minerals in 

the initial moments of turn on/turn off of exciting magnetic field. The researches of SPM 

effects in various areas of the world with TEM-FAST (predecessor of actual TEM-FAST 48 

system) between 1985 and 1998 have shown the following facts: 

 

- most intensive SPM effects exist in areas of effusive and volcanic-sedimentary rocks. 

Superficial clay formations covering parent rocks are most superparamagnetic, 

- SPM effects take place in conditions of long-term permafrost and usually are located on the 

border of zones of thawing frozen rocks, 

- significant SPM effects are observed on glaciers, 

- SPM is created, as a rule, by particles (radius of 10
-9
 to 10

-7
 m) of magnetite and 

maghemite. In practice, a SPM effect in TEM is usually treated as frequency dispersion of 

the rocks magnetic susceptibility, by analogy with frequency dispersion of conductivity (IP 

effect). The transient characteristic (reaction to step-type power off a magnetic field) of 

magnetic susceptibility øsùú it is conveniently simulated as a relaxation model of SPM in 
TEM.

The characteristic signature of SPM effect is the slow speed of the transient decay in time, 

with E(t) ~ t
-1
. For induction processes, E(t) decreases not slower than ~ t

-5/2
, as described 

early (expression 2.39). The usual identification of SPM in the TEM registered data is 

normally done with a t.E(t) versus t plot, as the late stages of transient signal containing SPM 

component, will show an almost constant behaviour in time (figure 2.29). In practice, 

because of different reasons the observable SPM processes decrease as E(t) ~ t

Figure 2.29 – Half earth model response without and with SPM effect from top layer, 

(k = 0.1 at 0.5-2.5 m depth influence). 

 

The precise calculations of transient’s response of horizontal layered conductive and SPM 

media, have shown, that the interaction of induction currents and SPM effects can be 

neglected, i.e. it is possible to consider these effects as purely additive. Reduction of SPM 

effect influencing TEM sounding data at the acquisition level is possible by doing the 

following operations: 

 

- Reduce mutual inductance of antennas (M), when offset configuration is applied. Using two 

identical antennas shifted at some distance, ensuring practically zero stream coupling 

(mutual inductance of antennas M), can provide 50-100 times suppression of SPM signal. 

However in real field conditions, applicability can be tricky, and it is rather time-consuming. 

- Increase the size of the coincident loop. 

The signal in the coincident configuration is proportional to the square of the loop's area ~R
4
, 

while the SPM effect at small depth of bedding of magnetic layers, is proportional to size of 

antenna ~R. Thus, at the increase of the antenna's size from 50 to 100 m, the ratio between 

"useful" induction and "harmful" SPM effects will increase as a minimum at 8 times (~R
3
). 

- Uplift the coincident antenna above the surface of media. 

If SPM effect to a soil layer is not too intensive (that’s the case at 80% of situations) using 

small coincident antennas with a size not more than 50 m × 50 m is a rather effective way 

both from the point of view of results, and from the point of view of minimization of work time. 

The rising of a 25 m × 25 m loop antenna at 1 to 1.5 meters aboveground is easily realizable 

and allows a SPM effects reduction of 3 to 4 times.

Figure 2.30 – SPM effect with three different sizes square loop, over sedimentary 

rocks in permafrost conditions at Norilsk, Russia (adapted from AEMR, 2006). 

 

At field acquisition, it is necessary to do analysis of registered data to control SPM signal 

distortions and if necessary, change the antenna’s configuration. This analyses is done 

under the assumption that SPM distortions act at late stages of the process with E(t) ~ t
-1
. 

The observed resistivity ??t?  sharply decreases to "unreal low" values and the apparent 
resistivity curves ?²?t? , on late times for different loop sizes, show parallel abruptly falling 
down branches, like the given example at figure 2.30. The SPM effect can be taken, not as a 

harmful signal, but as useful information about researched media, which can be accessed 

with different configurations of loops. It is also possible to measure SPM in rock samples at 

the laboratory (or directly in-field conditions, using special portable sensors) (AEMR, 2006).

TEM MODELLING THEORY 

 

This third chapter presents an overview of TEM data modelling. The forward (direct problem) 

solution for a layered half-space (1D problem) is described. Inversion methods are also 

discussed, including joint TEM and VES soundings. 

 

 

3.1 – Layered half-space TEM response 
 

The conductive half-space TEM response, with their full and asymptotic formulation has been 

given on previous chapter. We have seen that with a loop source over a horizontal ground, 

the only field transmitted in the TEM method is a transverse electric field (TE). Hence, only 

the Schelkunoff scalar potential F is necessary for a derivation of the vertical magnetic field 

in the loop’s centre. Under this one-dimensional (1D) layered earth assumption, potential F 

consists of one component only, the z-component. The z-direction is the vertical (positive 

downward), x and y defines the horizontal planes. The TE mode of this potential F is: 

 

    ? ? ???? ; TE	    (3.1) 
 

where ?? is a scalar function of x, y and z (?? is the unit vector in the z-direction). TE	 denotes 
the transverse electric field, which is the field propagating in the xy-plane. 

 

Substituting expression (3.1) into chapter 2 equations (2.29) and (2.30) enables the 

expression of the field components; 

 

   
? ? ??
 ?2??????  ; ?? ? ? ????y    (3.2a) 
 

   
? ? ??
 ?2??????  ; ?? ? ????x    (3.2b) 
 

   
? ? ??
 ? ?2??2 ? ??? ?? ; ?? ? 0    (3.2c) 
 

For a parallel plane 1D model consisting of source-free regions, as well as regions containing 

sources, the derived general Schelkunoff F potential has been written as an expression 

(2.31). From expression (2.34), a circular loop (radius ? and current I) with a vertical dipole 
magnetic moment m, is then (Ward and Hohmann, 1988):

The derived vertical magnetic component at the centre of the loop, with the loop position on 

the earth’s surface (height null for z and h), by (3.2c) application, became:

with r01 the already mention reflection coefficient. 
 

The reflection coefficient relates the amplitude amount of the plane-wave EM components 

that are reflected to the original travel media, when an interface exists (between two different 

media). It can be written in terms of the plane-wave impedance or admittance (Ward and 

Hohmann, 1988), which is defined as the ratios of the amplitudes of the orthogonal electric 

and magnetic-field pairs: 

     ; ? 1&lt;=&gt; ? ? 1&gt;=&amp;lt;    (3.5a) 
 

     ? ? =&gt;1&amp;lt;? ? =&lt;1&gt;     (3.5b) 
 

These relations hold for wave propagation in the positive z-direction. If waves are traveling in 

negative z-direction, the relations reverse their sign. 

 

The reflection coefficient, for normal wave incidence, is written as: 

 

     r01 ? @A,@B@AC@B     (3.6a)

quantities already introduced at chapter 2. Knight and Raiche (1982), have found that for 

greater numerical stability, this recursive relation works better if formulated with f,?IV instead 
of tanh Zg$. 

Figure 3.1 – Horizontal and parallel N-layered half-space earth, 

with defined physical parameters at each layer. 

 

Equation (3.4) is expressed in the frequency domain (r01 is a function of frequency). The 
response in the time-domain (transient response), is obtained by inverse Laplace transform 

or inverse Fourier transform. The integral in (3.4) is called a Hankel integral. There is no 

analytical solution for this integral, and it must be evaluated by numerical methods. That task 

is faster if digital filtering is applied, instead of just compute the numerical integration of the 

Hankel transform (Bessel function decays slowly and set direct numerical integration to be a 

time-consuming task). The integration function (3.4) is the product of two functions; Bessel 

function times a kernel function, the latter with model and signal information. An alternative 

method to Bessel function evaluation was given by Koefoed et al. (1972) by digital filtering. 

Anderson (1979) defines latter digital filters to this problem. The linear relation between the 

kernel function and the magnetic field is used. The magnetic field is given by linear filtering. 

With this procedure, it’s not necessary to re-compute the kernel function every time, 

speeding numerical calculations. Applying the natural logarithmic transforms as stated by 

Koefoed et al. (1972), results into a convolution between the input function and output filter 

response. The input function can be taken as the adding of sinc functions. The output 

function is given by the integral adding of the sinc filter response. (Koefoed et al., 1972). The 

sinc filter spectrum response is the sinc spectrum times the filter spectrum. The final result is 

given by inverse Fourier transform of the sinc filter response. 

 

Modelling TEM responses includes sometimes convolutions with low-pass filter, like specified 

by Effersø et al., (1999) and turn-on and turn-off ramps effects (Fitterman and Anderson, 

1987). Each equipment has its own acquisition specifications, and those parameters must be 

taken into account for a perfect modelling and comparison with field data.

3.1.1 – Forward 1D TEM response 
 

For the N layer model, we have the usual 2N-1 number of model parameters, if we just take 

the N layers electric conductivity and the N-1 layer’s thickness, with permeability and 

permittivity equal to their free space values. With this parameters set, a response at the earth 

surface can now be computed. 

 

Three models are presented at figure 3.2; a uniform half-space and two 3 layers models. The 

forward solution to these models is given at figure 3.3. It expresses basic different behaviour 

between a half-space to a layered one. The responses are for a single 50 m × 50 m square 

loop. 

Figure 3.2 – Uniform half-space (model 1) and three-layer models; one with a low-resistivity 

layer embedded in a high-resistive background (model 2) and one with a high-resistivity 

layer embedded in a low-resistivity background (model 3). 

 

The emf signal offset between model 2 and model 1 response is greater than offset between 

models 3 and 1 response (figure 3.3a). Model 2 and 3 signals do not decay anymore with 

t
-5/2

. The apparent resistivity plot exhibit also great differences. The top layers definitely 

perturb the sounding curve, and no uniform half-space can represent this behaviour 

anymore. Regardless of these, later stages points converge asymptotically to the bottom 

layer resistivity (figure 3.3b). 

 

Figure 3.4 plots the spatial current density at three different times after transmitter signal 

turn-off, for the same set of models. Only one side section of the current system is shown. 

Figure 3.4a) shows the current density in the homogeneous half space. For the 1D half-

space the current flows cylindrically and symmetrically around the vertical axis through the 

centre of the transmitter loop. The current maximum moves downwards and outwards as 

time passes. The current densities are normalized to the maximum value at that time giving 

the same maximum amplitude in all plots. Although the real values are very different, with 

maximum amplitude at time 10 µs some 10
6
 times larger than at 1000 µs. The darker grey 

regions indicate larger current densities. 

 

For model 2 (low-resistivity layer embedded in high-resistivity layers) at figure 3.4b) we see 

that already at 100 µs after the turn-off of the current pulse, the maximum of the current 

density is located in the low-resistivity layer (layer 2). Later at 1000 µs the maximum stays in

that layer. Later at 1000 µs the maximum stays in that layer. When compared to the 

homogeneous half-space (figure 3.4a), the low-resistivity layer interrupts the normal diffusion 

pattern and acts as a shield for the high resistivity layer below.

with TEMRES software (AEMR)

For model 3 (high-resistivity layer embedded in low-resistivity layers) at figure 3.4c) we see 

that at 100 µs the current density exists and is divided between the top and the bottom 

layers. The current density in the high-resistivity layer is very low. At 1000 µs the current 

density distribution is “entirely at the bottom layer skipping the high-resistivity layer” in the 

middle. The implication to this is that the resulting sounding curve retains very limited 

information on this resistive layer. 

 

These different responses put into evidence that TEM method is highly sensitive to low-

resistivity layers (conductive layers) simply because a larger amount of the current flows in 

these layers. The diffusion speed depends on the resistivity of the layers, i.e. the diffusion 

speed is high for high-resistivity layers and low for low-resistivity layers, as given by 

expression (2.27). 

 

 

3.2 – Inversion methods 
 

To analyse the field data sounding curve, we need to compare it against an output curve 

from a give forward model result, for instance a 1D layer model. There are several schemes 

proposed for direct problem or approximate analysis of TDEM data, e.g. (Nekut, 1987), 

(Smith et al., 1994). Meju (1995) proposes a simple approximate scheme for electromagnetic 

data analysis. The scheme for transforming TDEM apparent resistivity data into approximate 

resistivity-versus-depth information is an adaptation of the Niblett-Bostick transformation 

used in magnetotelluric data analysis (Bostick, 1977). 

 

If the field and computed curves have a good match, then the suggested model is a 

(possible) model to explain the field data. This is a trial-and-error process that is a kind of 

inverse problem. Many techniques have been developed, and the underlying theory of the 

inverse problem is well described in the geophysical literature from several authors, e.g. 

Jackson (1972 and 1979), Twomey (1977), Tarantola and Valette (1982), Menke (1984), 

Constable et al., (1987), Meju (1994a and 1994b), Parker (1994), Newman and Alumbaugh 

(1997), Scales et al. (2001), Tarantola (2005), Aster et al. (2005). 

 

3.2.1 – General data inversion 
 

Knowledge of the subsoil properties by data acquired on earth’s surface is a typical case of 

the inverse problem’s geophysical applications. For a given set of model’s parameters and 

values, response must fit the observed data at discrete points. This model is not unique and 

equivalence problems can exist. The number of solutions (models) is also enhanced by the 

addition of data errors. 

 

To solve the inverse problem it’s necessary to: 

 

1 - Parameterize the model, i.e. split the earth domain under study to discrete and uniform 

proprieties’ regions. Assuming 1D models these are just thickness layers with some physical 

attributed parameters (resistivity or conductivity). At 2D we have cells and at 3D volumetric 

defined blocks.  



TEM MODELLING THEORY 
________________________ 

 51

2 - Express a relation between the model parameters and observational data – direct 

problem issue for the used array. 

 

3 - Apply a satisfactory method that finds the closest model response to observed data. At 

this stage, two kinds of methodologies can be used; local and global search methodologies. 

The local methods seek solutions from the start model. At the global one, solution search is 

done at a wider solution space. The former can be the least-square adjustment and the later 

the simulated annealing method. 

 

 

3.2.2 – Model parameterization 
 

The complexity of a discrete model is a function of the given dimension. Any finite space h, 
were some variable physical properties do exist, can be divided into a limited number of 

discrete geometric elements, with constant physical properties of each element. Taken the 

classical 1D TEM approach, the physical property under study is the electric resistivity (?) 

and geometric thickness (h) of each horizontal layer. These comprise the m vector’s 

parameter of the problem with M elements. 

 

Being i j$ the functional relating model parameters to model response (direct problem), the 
model response over h space is then: 
 

    ) k l$mno p q k[lr]DrsP ? t   (3.11) 
 

Where u is the data vector. 

 

The corresponding matrix equation is: 

 

      t ? ?j    (3.12) 
 

and ? is the matrix relating the u data line matrix to the m parameters column matrix. 
 

 

3.2.3 – Least-square linear inverse problem 
 

When a linear relation prevails between u and m, when expression (3.12) can be written for 

discrete data and model regions: 

 

     ZK ? q ?KrlrDrsP     (3.13) 
 

In reality, the collected data have always an associated error, leading to the impossibility of a 

model response to perfectly match it. To account for this, the data error vector e is added to 

the problem, 

 



TEM MODELLING THEORY

      t ? ?j ? u    (3.14) 
 

“Finding a solution” is the same as to minimize the difference between the observed data and 

calculated values from the direct problem. The way is to reach a minimal value to the added 

residual squares – the least squares’ method (Menke, 1989). That is accomplished with 

minimization of the objective function Q, that quantifies misfit. 
 

    Q ? uwu ?  t ? ?j$w t ? ?j$   (3.15) 
 

Where u represents the observed data and Fm the model response. The minimization, 

against parameters mj , is given by: 

 

      
?x?ly ? 0     (3.16) 

with solution: 

 

     j ? [?w?],??wt    (3.17) 
 

This is the least square solution to the linear problem, without any constrains, and [?w?],??w 
is the known generalized inverse matrix operator, which applied to the data vector u 

recover the m vector of parameters. This is true if the number of model parameters equals 

the number of observed data points. In this linear case, the model can be found from data in 

just one step. On the other hand, if the number of data exceeds the number of model 

parameters, the problem is over-determined and there will be an infinite number of solutions. 

 

 

3.2.4 – Least-square non-linear inverse problem 
 

With a non linear situation, expression (3.12) is still valid if a conversion to a linear 

approximation is found. The usual way is to expand the model response by Taylor’s series, 

around a starting initial model (m
0
); 

 

      i j%$     (3.18) 
 

Taken i j$ to be linear around the m0 model, the Taylor expansion becomes: 
 

 iz[j%] ? {iz{|? }|? ? {iz{|( }|( ? ~ ? {iz{|? }|? ? higher order terms (3.19) 
 

In short condensed form; 

 

  i j$ ? i[j%] ? ?? ??? ?$?ly
?
rsP ??s?. ?

?lr? ? O ??l??$  (3.20) 
 

regardless of superior order terms. This approximation is only valid to converging series; that 

is, ?lr must be small for all j indexes.  



TEM MODELLING THEORY 
________________________ 

 53

Like previously result, the misfit between data and model response must become: 

 

     ? ? t ? i j$     (3.21) 
is the difference vector between observed data (u) and model response. 

If the Jacobean matrix 3 with partial derivatives of i against lr parameter is: 
 

    3 ?
??
??
??G ?$?l1 ~ ??G ?$?l?? ? ???A ?$?l1 ~ ??A ?$?l? ??

??    (3.22) 
 

and 

     ? ? ?j     (3.23) 
 
is the adjustment vector to be applied at each lr parameter, misfit vector e can now be 
rewritten as: 

 

   t ? i j$ ? ? ? *?[j%] ? 3?2 ? ? ? 3?   (3.24) 
 

Again, by least square method, a similar expression to (3.17) is found: 

 

     ? ? [3w3],?3w?    (3.25) 
 

b represent the small change over the m parameters to gets a better fit to the starting model 

response. 

 

     j? ? j% ? ?     (3.26) 
 

If the new model m
1
 is still far from the “true model”, i.e., if the model response does not fit to 

a certain degree the observed data, the process is repeated, but now taking as new starting 

model the m
1
. These operations are repeated iteratively until a reasonable solution with a 

good fit is found. The next expression gives the generic iterative process scheme: 

 

     j?CP ? j? ? [3w3],?3w?   (3.27) 
 

and to each iterative step a new Jacobean matrix 3 must be calculated. New model is always 
found from previous one. This iterative method is known as Gauss-Newton method (Meju, 

1998). 

 

The method is simple and powerful, but can be tricky producing solutions with no physical 

meaning when the 3w3 matrix is singular (or almost singular). That is, when eigenvalues are 
near zero. When the 3w3 matrix is not singular, very slow convergence can take place or even 
diverging situations, due to a wrong chosen starting model. To overcome this, any previous 

information – a priori information, like former processed data, logging data and geologic 

knowledge can be incorporated to have a better start model.

3.2.5 – Smoothed inverse problems 
 

It’s possible to impose certain limitation to the m parameter values. That is done, for 

instance, to 1D inversion, by fixing lower and higher limits to each of the electric resistivity 

and thickness layer’s values. In 2D and 3D inversion, the assigned parameter values of each 

domain cell or block element can be “closely” related with the neighborhood ones by the 

roughness quantity. Smooth constrains methodology applications are published from various 

authors like Constable et al. (1987), Sasaki (1989, 1992 and 1994), DeGroot-Hedlin and 

Constable (1990), Sasaki et al. (1992), Zhang and Hobbs (1992). 

 

A similar methodology for 1D inversion, taken into account nearby soundings to construct a 

quasi-2D pseudo-section, is known as Lateral Constrained Inversion (LCI), and has been 

applied over galvanic and EM data, (Auken et al., 2001, 2002 and 2005a), (Santos, 2004), 

(Auken and Christiansen, 2004), (Mansoor et al., 2006). Viezzoli et al., (2008) have 

presented a new methodology, Spatially Constrained Inversion (SCI), which produces quasi-

3D modeling by taken into account not only soundings along a given profile, but also from 

across profiles. 

 

The roughness of the model parameters can be expressed as: 

 

      ? ? ?j    (3.28) 
 

where ? is the Laplacian roughening matrix. 
 

The objective function Q, must now include not only the data misfit term (Q?) but the 
smoothness one also (Q?). 
 

    Q ? Q? ? _Q? ? uwu ? ??w?    (3.29) 
 7 is the Lagrange multiplier (damping factor) that controls the amplitude of the parameter 
corrections and oscillations and the fastness of convergence. Too high ? value means a very 
smooth model and a worse data fitting. Too low ? vanish with the smooth constrain. The 
usual procedure is to start with a relatively high ? value and diminish it throughout the 
iteration process. 

 

With this new formulation, the solution of the inversion using the linear approach becomes 

(Menke, 1989): 

 

    j ? [?w? ? ??wC],??wt    (3.30) 
 

and the parameters correction for the non-linear case are calculated by: 

 

    ? ? [3w3 ? ??wC],?3w?    (3.31)

3.2.6 – Matrix equations solving methods 
 

There are several different methods to solve the (3.12) equation system. The conjugate 

gradient is an iterative method to search local minimum by gradient method analyses of 

minimizing function (Hestenes and Stiefel, 1952). Converging process ends by reaching a 

predefined limited number of steps or to a predefined misfit value. The implemented code 

algorithm it’s easily found in the literature, like Press et al. (1992). From this method, several 

others do exist, e.g. the biconjugate gradient method. 

 

 

The singular value decomposition (SVD) (or spectral decomposition) is an important 

factorization method of a rectangular real (or complex) matrix. It’s an excellent method to 

perform the least square’s data fitting, and is nowadays most applied at geophysical data 

analyses, because is mathematically robust and numerically stable giving also tools for 

analyses of the model results. Applied computing SVD data methods back to the fifths of last 

century, and a detailed description is given by Lanczos (1958) and Jackson (1972). Today 

the computing most-used code is the one from Golub and Reinsch (1970). The 

decomposition of the matrix F is written as: 

 

     ? ?  ¡¢w     (3.32) 
 

where   is an orthogonal data space eigenvector matrix with the same dimension (m × n as ?), ¡ is a diagonal matrix (n × n) of nonnegative elements (singular values of ?, usually listed 
in descending order) and ¢ is a singular orthogonal parameters space eigenvector matrix (n 
× n) (Meju, 1998), and: 

 

     w  ? ¢w¢ ? ¢¢w ? £    (3.33) 
 

where £ is the identity matrix. 
 

Whit this formulation, expression (3.17) becomes then; 

 

     j ? ¢¡,? wt    (3.34) 
 

and the damped equivalent expression (3.31) becomes; 

 

    j ? ¢[¡( ? ??wC],?£¡ wt    (3.35) 
 

 

The advantage of the SVD is that it also gives the inversion statistics, with the importance 

value of each model parameter. A unitary importance means that parameter has strong 

importance on the model’s fit output, and a smaller value (near zero) means that parameter 

has little influence on the model’s fit (Strack, 1992).

3.2.7 – Simulated Annealing method 
 

The Simulated Annealing (SA) it’s a global minimization method (Monte Carlo class), with the 

ability to lock for the solution over a wider solution space. The process is similar, and its 

name comes from the annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled 

cooling of a material to reorient internal particles and reduce their defects. This method is 

controlled by the initial temperature (T0 &gt; 0 and generally high) and cooling rate of T. With a 

high-temperature value the model parameters are allowed to have a greater variability (like 

kinetic energy of the particles in the metal), but as temperature drops those values freezes 

around the absolute minimum of it. To avoid falling at a local minimum, even with a rise in the 

objective function, a comparison is made between the acceptance probably function, defined 

as: 

 

      ¤ ? u ,¥? w? $    (3.36) 
 

and a generated random number ¦ (between 0 and 1). ?E is the objective function variation. 
If ¨ © ¦ then the variation of the parameters is accepted. This is the basis of the Metropolis 
algorithm proposed at Metropolis et al. (1953). From (3.36) equation we see when T is high 

(at beginning) almost all variations are taken, but with low T the chance to be accepted is 

less and less probable. Application and introduction of this process in the framework of 

inverse theory was done by Rothman (1985a, 1985b, 1986). 

 

To be efficient, the cooling temperature rate must be small, to allow a correct search over the 

model parameters’ space (which is normally limited). But if this is too small, and if initial T is 

also too high, we get a long computing time. With this method, and because the process is 

randomly established, each run output a different model. The final model is usually 

calculated from the analysis of several runs (e.g. 10) to check coherency between all of 

them. 

 

 

3.2.8 – Joint inversion method 
 

The acquired geophysical data over the earth have the signature of the structures beneath it, 

and each method sample only some physiochemical state of geological and/or man-made 

targets. Upon this, conclusions can be drawn about the structures. However, each applied 

method as its own practical and theoretical limitations. For instance, no single conductivity 

sounding technique provides complete, consistent and sufficient data to characterize 

completely the subsurface. Moreover, the effectiveness of each technique varies from one 

geological environment to another, as the various measurements’ sets are influenced 

differently by the presence of small-sized three-dimensional bodies in the very near-surface 

(Meju, 2005). 

 

When different sets of geophysical data do exist from the same area, taken with different 

methodologies or techniques, a joint inversion can be done if they share some (or not) 

common physical propriety. The resulting model’s parameters must give a good solution 



TEM MODELLING THEORY

replicating the different data sets. There are basically two approaches to the joint inversion 

problem. The first one is the structural approach, where the inversion seeks for a common 

structure of the models. In the second one the inversion seeks for values of parameters that 

are related through empirical relationships. For example, the joint inversion of seismic and 

resistivity data can only be done using the structural approach (Gallardo and Meju, 2003 and 

2004).The parametric approach is commonly used with electromagnetic and electrical 

resistivity data. In this case, both the geometry (thickness) and resistivity values are taken as 

parameters into the inversion process. The integration of these data (e.g. DC and TEM) can 

improve the robustness of model interpretation and the cumulative probability of detection of 

subsurface targets. Several authors have developed joint inversion with DC resistivity, 

magnetotelluric (MT) and TEM data, e.g. Vozoff and Jupp (1975), Jupp and Vozoff (1977), 

Meju (1996), Harinarayana (1999). 

 

The 1D joint inverse problem can be accomplished by the use of a least-square criterion with 

SVD as a solving method (sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.6) or by SA approach (section 3.2.7.). 

Concerning the DC and TEM joint inversion, besides the parameters’ calculation, attention 

must be taken also to the well know “static shift” effect of the DC data. This effect arises from 

small-scale irregularities around the source and readings’ electrodes, and gives a constant 

(logarithmic) resistivity shift to the same aperture MN/2 segment data (DC soundings). That 

can be known and corrected comparing the TEM and DC apparent resistivity curves. To 

perform such comparison, we can use the empirical relation from Meju (2005) in order to plot 

them together: 

 

      t ? ªM.«Q?¬     (3.37) 
 

with t the transient time (in s) and L the half electrode-array length (AB/2 distance, in m). 

 

Sometimes TEM data soundings’ acquisition is exclusively used to quantify and correct the 

static shift over DC and MT data sets. 

 

 

3.2.9 – Lateral and spatially constrained joint TEM inversion 
 

The joint inversion of nearby soundings, usually stitched-together along a profile, was 

originally developed for inverting continuous DC data sets (Sørensen, 1996). The 1D-LCI 

technique, already mentioned at 3.2.5 section, uses sharp layer boundaries and solves a 

number of 1D problems simultaneously with constraints between neighboring models. The 

limitations are that it requires all separate 1D models have the same model parameters’ 

subset, and it works best at environments with relatively smooth lateral resistivity variations, 

like sedimentary areas. All the models and the corresponding data sets are inverted 

simultaneously; minimizing a common object function (Auken and Christiansen, 2004) 

thereby creating a quasi-2D image from a 1D based forward solution. The lateral constraints 

and constraints from a-priori information are all part of the data vector together with the 

measured apparent resistivity data. Due to the lateral constraints’ algorithm, the model 

parameter’s information will spread smoothly to the neighbours models so the parameters in 

those near models have to be equal within certain limits.  



TEM MODELLING THEORY 
________________________ 

 58

Auken and Christiansen (2004) have also introduced the 2D-LCI algorithm. It uses the same 

formulation as the 1D-LCI inversion scheme, but the difference is that the forward model is 

2D. This means that 2D formulation can handle larger lateral variations in the subsurface 

resistivity. With the 1D-LCI method approach, inversion of TEM data in a 3D environment is 

possible. Studies show that if the geological environment consists of gently varying 3D 

structures with moderate resistivity contrasts, the 1D inversion approach in most cases will 

give a good recovery of the true model. When environments with high-resistivity contracts 

and strong 3D features exist the 1D based inversion algorithm is strongly influenced by 3D 

effects and will in many cases provide unreliable models. These 3D structures’ effects in 1D 

interpretation of TEM data have been dealt by; e.g. Newmann et al, (1987), Goldman et al. 

(1994), Auken (1995), Hördt and Scholl (2004) and Auken et al. (2008). 

 

The quasi-3D inversion, the mathematical formulation of the SCI method is very similar to 

that of the LCI method (Auken and Christiansen, 2004). It is a least-squares inversion of a 

layered earth regularized through spatial constraints, which gives the smoothed lateral 

transitions. Main difference between the SCI and LCI methodologies are the entries in the 

roughening matrix ?. In SCI, the constraints are also applied to offline soundings so each 
model parameter is connected to many other model parameters of the same kind, not only to 

neighboring along-line soundings. Nevertheless, in both LCI and SCI, ? is sparse. Another 
major difference is that over the spatial domain, the constraining points have to follow a 

Delaunay triangulation (Viezzoli et al., 2008). 

 

Upon this SCI methodology, a spatially constrained 1D inversion algorithm for quasi-3D TEM 

response was tested over synthetic data models. The algorithm code was implemented by 

Fernando Santos (personal communication) and details are given at Santos et al. (2011), 

Santos and El-Kaliouby (2011). The forward 1D calculation is based on the single loop 

configuration for a layered earth (Raiche, 1984). Care was taken to accurately calculate the 

early times’ response and this forward TEM algorithm account for the ramp time effect. The 

data are the logarithms of the apparent resistivity values (versus time) at sounding’s sites. 

The model parameters are the resistivity logarithms of the hexahedral model blocks beneath 

each sounding measurement site. The block thickness increases to depth following an 

exponentially rule, with an initial value (Z0) and an increase factor (step) given by: 

 

     ;Hf­®¯° W,P$ m    (3.38) 
 

to the n
th
 thickness layer. The number of layers (vertical blocks) is chosen by user. 

 

The minimization of an appropriate objective function allows the estimation of the corrections 

to the model parameters at each iteration. At this code, the defined objective function is: 

 

   Q ? ?¡± ?± ? 3?³$?( ? ??? ³ ? ³%$?(   (3.39) 
 

where ¡± is a diagonal matrix, consisting of the reciprocal of data error standard deviations, ?± is the vector of the differences between the logarithms of the apparent resistivity of the 
calculated model responses and of the observed measured data, 3 is the Jacobian (derivative 
matrix) containing the derivatives of the model responses with respect to the model

parameters, ?³ is the vector containing the corrections to the model parameters, and ³% is 
the a priori defined model. Damping factor ? it is set (empirically) at beginning and decreased 
by a factor of 0.8 at each iteration. The elements of the matrix ? are the roughness 
coefficients of each parameter (block resistivity); defined in terms of the neighbor’s proximity. 

Minimization of expression (3.39) yields the normal equations: 

 

  ?³ ? [3w¡±w¡±3 ? ??wC],? 3w¡±w¡±?± ? ??w? ³ ? ³%$$  (3.40) 
 

After solving this equations set, the model parameters ³ are then updated by adding the 
vector ?³. The iteration procedure continues until the misfit is reduced to an acceptable level 
(user defined) or an iteration limit number is reached. 

 

Firstly, over the inversion of data acquired over a uniform 10 ohm.m resistivity half-space 

was tested. Apparent resistivity TEM curve response was computed for a single 25 m × 25 m 

side square loop sounding (figure 3.5). The numbers of soundings were set to 5; one at each 

corner of a 100 m side square and at its centre. This response curve was decimated to just 

21 data points, from 5.07 µs to 7.65 ms time. The number of layers to be inverted was 15. 

Shallow layer was set to 2 m (Z0) and the incremental step to 0.121. 

 

The computed outcome, from an initial damping factor of 2.0 and stopping criteria of 40 

maximum convergence iteration or 0.02 model to data misfit error, it’s below at figures 3.5 

and 3.6. All the computed five soundings 1D quasi-3D models are equal (as they had started 

from the same model and data set). 

Figure 3.5 – Synthetic apparent resistivity data points and model inversion response, 

to 10 ohm.m uniform half-space model. 

 

To quantify the misfit between the true model and the quasi-3D inversion calculated model, a 

measure root-mean-squared (rms) misfit error is defined:

with ?oi the observed apparent resistivity M data points and ?ci are the computed apparent 

resistivity model response, were N is the number of model parameters to fit. 

 

For this first test, the initial starting model was set uniform with 20 ohm.m. The difference 

between the computed model and the true model is high, 29.6% (after 21 iterations). Half this 

misfit value comes from the last layer. With this inversion methodology, all models are to be 

greatly smoothed when compared against usual 1D inversion, as the fixed layers’ depth 

inhibits sharp and high resistivity contrast layers. 

Figure 3.6 – Inversion model against true model (corresponding to figure 3.5 data). 

 

Next step was to recovery the resistivity values for a three-layer model with the same TEM 

geometry (see Table 3.1). The two tested models decrease their resistivity values with depth. 

Figure 3.7 shows the responses of those models.

The starting model was again set uniform to 20 ohm.m with the same 15 layers and initial 

damping factor equal to 2.0. The difference between the calculated model and the true one is 

16.6% (14 iterations) and 39.7% (27 iterations), respectively to model2 and model3. Model3 

misfit drops to 18.4% if the second layer is not accounted for (figure 3.8). All five soundings 

calculated from the models are accordingly equal and fit well the data. With the layer 

thickness increased a better step and contrast response is achieved. The last layer resistivity 

value is very well established for these two test models.

The fourth model test has a dipping initial layer. 1D models beneath TEM soundings 1 and 2 

are designed as model4a, beneath TEM sounding 3 as model4b and beneath TEM 

soundings 4 and 5 as model4c, as described at Table 3.2 and presented at figure 3.9, with 

the same size loops. The starting uniform model was set to 20 ohm.m with 15 layers and 

initial damping factor equal to 1.0. Outputs of the inversion are given at figure 3.10 and 3.11. 

Results after 38 iterations show differences to the true model of 19.5%, 16.1% and 18.2%, 

respectively at TEM 1 and 2 (model4a), TEM 3 (model4b) and TEM 4 and 5 (model4c). The 

dipping layer is detected and represented by layers with smooth resistivity transition between 

the top and lower model layers when in between those there is a thinner layer.

With the same TEM data sounding inputs the quasi-3D models beneath TEM 1 and 2 

soundings are almost the same ones (the same is true with TEM 4 and 5). The fifth quasi-3D 

test was done with the same previous settings, but adding a maximum 5% random noise to 

each TEM data sounding. The quasi-3D pair models’ TEM 1 and 2 results are much alike 

and similar to the model than those from earlier test (figure 3.12). After 30 iterations, the 

difference between true and calculated models is 17.9% and 16.2%, for TEM 1 and 2 

respectively.

A comparable result is obtained from TEM 3. With this noise level, the model is much alike 

the previous one (figure 3.13). After 30 iterations, the difference between true and calculated 

models is 19.1%, slightly higher than that from early test.

The quasi-3D models from TEM 4 and 5 results are also much alike and similar to the 

previous models (figure 3.14). After the same 30 iterations, the difference between true and 

calculated models is 18.9% and 19.3%, for TEM 4 and 5 respectively. 

 

Figure 3.14 – Inversion models against true models, for a) TEM 4 and model4c, 

b) TEM 5 and model4c. 

 

These tests showed that the quasi-3D algorithm successfully recovers the existing resistivity 

structure with 20% error level, just starting with an initial uniform half-space resistivity model. 

The higher number of model layers greatly smoothes the resistivity contrast results, as 

expected. The resistivity of the last layer is usually very well calculated at all tested models.

TEM-FAST 48 TESTS 

 

On this chapter, the TEM-FAST 48 equipment and some software are tested over a known 

conductive environment where DC geoelectric soundings have also been acquired. Results 

are compared between each method and with seismic profiles. Joint inversion of TEM with 

VES (Vertical Electric Sounding) and TEM to VES data conversion was also tested. 

 

 

4.1 – Test site description 
 

To test the TEM-FAST 48 equipment system a wide open and flat land space was chosen, at 

the Lower Tagus Cenozoic Basin (LTCB). It is a tectonic depression filled with Cenozoic 

sediments that hosts the lower reach of the Tagus River which flows along the Lower Tagus 

Valley (LTV), figure 4.1.

4.1.1 – Test site geologic description 
 

The test site geology is characterized by recent (plisto-holocenic and quaternary) 

sedimentary deposits of yellowish gravel with intercalated grey clay and an expected 

thickness of 60-70 meter (figure 4.2). Above this we have recent soil and silt filling in the 

many natural and man-made channels that drain the water from these flat and low lands (2 to 

3 m above the Tagus river water surface). Bellow these initial formations are 150 m thickness 

pliocenic yellow and whitish coarse sandy with rubble and small brown clay intrusion, 

followed by the miocenic one composed by shells limestone sandstone. Miocenic formation 

attains some 200-400 m thickness in the southwest part of the basin. 

Figure 4.2 - Well locations and available logs in the Porto Alto area (at northeast of test area), drilled 

for water supply. a: Holocene; P - Pleistocene; N - Neogene. Profiles locations are also shown. 

(Adapted from Carvalho et al., 2006). 

 

The underground water free level is very near the surface, some 0.5 to 1 m depth. This 

groundwater is highly conductive because all the area is under estuarine water influence, a 

mixture of fresh waters from the river and Atlantic ocean salty water. The measured water 

electric conductivity value at the surface drainage channels was 9300 µS.cm
-1
 (1.08 ?.m) at 

20 ºC. 

 

 

4.2 – Test field work 
 

The locations of the TEM and VES soundings are given at figure 4.3. They were conducted 

over three nearby and parallel north-30-east profiles. The centres of VES arrays are 

coincident with TEM square loop centres. The VES array direction is also along the profile’s 

orientation. TEM single square loops are 50 m × 50 m and loops centre are contiguous 25 m 

apart each other. Profile PA3 comprises 16 TEM soundings. Profiles PA4 and PA5 have both 

10 TEM soundings. Over each profile, five VES have been done, also spaced by 25 m. 

Westwards the PA5 profile is 50 m apart from PA4 profile (at the west side of the country 

road), and the latter is 85 m from the eastern PA3 profile (at the east side of the road). The 

fieldwork was conducted during 2005 summer’s beginning; with a dry soil condition (2005 

was a very dry year in Portugal).

All these profiles have been done coincident with seismic lines, named PA3 to PA5 (Porto 

Alto), acquired in a previous work concerning the application of high-resolution seismic 

reflection method to detection near-surface faulting in two major tectonic structures at Tagus 

Valley (Carvalho et al., 2006). At that time, VES with larger AB/2 distances were also 

acquired nearby the seismic profiles. 

 

The region is a wild life protected area, but many places are still mainly used to bovine cattle 

production, and the land is usually grass covert. Some of these wide areas have metallic 

fences stacked to the ground by wood pools. That was the situation at the tested place, with 

a border fence along each side of the road. The nearest high-power transmission lines are 

far way, 10 km north and also 8 km to the west.

4.2.1 – VES data 
 

The VES data acquisition followed the traditional and standard field procedure for the 

Schlumberger array. Field equipment belongs to the Geophysics Group (Lisbon Science 

Faculty), and it is self-made equipment. Current electrode separation (AB/2) varied from 1 m

up to 200 m, giving eight apparent resistivity values per logarithmic decade. The measured 

electric potential (MN) was done with the gradual step spreading, from 0.5 m to 8 m. The 

VES soundings’ data (apparent resistivity) are shown in figure 4.4. 

Figure 4.4 – VES sounding curves data points at each profile, apparent resistivity versus depth (AB/2). 

 

The VES curves are of the H type, starting at a mean apparent resistivity value of 3-5 ?.m, 

decreasing to mean value of 0.6-0.8 ?.m and increasing afterwards to higher apparent 

resistivities. The last couple points exhibit greater experimental errors, at 20% order. With 

these low apparent resistivity values, effective depth of investigation is much less than real 

AB/2 distances, as most current density flows and stays at the near surface. 

 

 

4.2.2 – VES data modelling 
 

1D inversion of the VES data was done with the classical horizontal layers’ inversion tools. 

The forward problem is solved calculating the electric field created by a point source over a 

homogeneous and isotropic horizontal layer earth (Stefanesco et al. 1930). The digital 

filtering theory (Ghosh, 1971a, 1971b) is applied to relate the apparent resistivity to the 

resistivity transform as defined by Koefoed (1970, 1979). In this way, the apparent resistivity 

response of a model (with specific layer’s resistivity and thickness) is computed. 

 

The inversion problem is solved as stated at previous section (3.2), by the SVD method. The 

starting model to initiate the process is taken from the asymptotic analyses of the data field 

curve. From all possibilities, the simpler (fewer number of layers) model is chosen. At some 

VES, the misfit of the five layers model was the smallest, but the corresponding geoelectric 

model makes nonsense when compared with the surrounding ones. At this level, we are just 

modelling the noise data features, as higher scattering is present at the last VES data points. 

The number of the layer that best satisfy all VES data is four. The observed shift between 

different constant MN segments is smaller, and correction was made to the initial MN branch. 

VES curves are similar, but a slight shift does exist among them.

The four layer models with the best fit are shown in figures 4.5 to 4.7. Minimum and 

maximum equivalent models were also computed. The mean values of the parameters and 

their bound’s errors (Raiche et al. 1985) are included in Tables 4.1 to 4.3. These Tables 

include also the computed root-mean-squared misfit error between the observed and

The first and very shallow layer is not well solved, with thickness always better solved as 

uncertainty is bigger to the computed resistivity. An S-equivalence (conductance 

equivalence) happens at several VES for the second layer. The third layer exhibits also 

equivalence, with thickness the worse constrained parameter. The first layer resistivity value 

and the third layer thickness are very bad resolved parameters. 

In the profile PA3 the bottom of the third layer varies from the profile edges to the centre, 

getting thicker at the middle of the profile. This behaviour can be accounted for the scattering 

of the data or can reflect a real feature as stated ahead. Note, however, that the third layer in 

profile PA4 and PA5 have less variation.

Looking to the third layer bottom position mean values; 24.6, 36.0 and 37.1 m, respectively 

from PA3 to PA5 profile, a bending interface can be inferred, deepping towards west. These 

values are in relatively good agreement with seismic refraction interpretation of a change in 

the seismic character of the reflectors at an average depth of 35 m to 45 m and correspond 

to the Quaternary base, figure 4.8 (Carvalho et al., 2006). 

 

The variations of the misfit error difference values between VES are justified by data quality 

of each curve. Curve model fit response against VES data points is plotted in figures 4.9 to 

4.11. The mean model at each profile was also computed, and parameters are very similar to 

each other, as can be seen at table 4.4.

4.2.3 – TEM data 
 

TEM data acquisition with TEM-FAST 48 was done with one external 12 V power battery. 

The EM induction signals were grabbed at full 48 time gate channels, with 15 stacks. That is 

3/4 of allowed maximum number of stack parameter. Registered mean output current value 

was 1.40 A, with a 200 m long electric cable (50 m × 50 m single, one turn loop). Most of 

TEM curve data points have very small residual errors (below 1%), except the last ones, 

above the 10 ms time mark, with more than 5% errors. The measured average noise level at 

1 ms time mark is around 2 to 3 nVm
-2
. The first three points, till the 6.07 µs are distorted by 

the antenna self-process at turn-off time. The curves are all very similar with small 

differences at first glance. The normalized emf measured values for selected time range 

channels are given at figures 4.13 to 4.15. The figures 4.16 presents some of the TEM 

soundings at profiles PA3 to PA5, corresponding to the VES positions.

Those intensity values are very similar in sounding to sounding and also between the 

different profiles, with minor differences. The apparent resistivities of these soundings are 

consequently, very similar too and are plotted at figure 4.17. Minimum apparent resistivity 

value is near 1.5 ?.m, and curve mimics the VES observed ones, as expected.

4.2.4 – TEM data modelling 
 

The 1D inversion of TEM soundings was done using the smaller layers’ number that gave 

best rms misfit error. The number of achieved layers (6) is greater than those ones found 

with VES, as TEM data exhibit greater quality. Side by side, comparison shows that TEM 

data point’s quality is higher than of VES, with very small scattering, except at the very last 

points (late time channels). 

 

Tables 4.5 to 4.7 contain TEM best models in profiles PA3, PA4 and PA5 respectively. Those 

soundings are at the same location of the VES soundings at each profile. The models are 

shown in figures 4.18 to 4.20, again respectively for profiles PA3, PA4 and PA5. Also 

included in each figure are all TEM soundings’ models for each profile.

TEM method can detect the first two layers, but as they are very shallow ones compared to 

the loop square length side, the corresponding thickness is not well solved. That is also true 

for the last but one layer thickness (fifth one), were a T-equivalence do exist between layers’ 

parameters. This fifth layer thickness is related to the last layer resistivity values that come 

from less quality data points (late time points with low SNR). 

 

The bottom of fourth layer with mean depth of about 35, 42 and 35 meters, at PA3, PA4 and 

PA5 profiles respectively, match the Quaternary base position taken from the seismic data. 

All the TEM models show also a low resistivity contrast between layer three and layer four. 

This interface exhibits a mean position value of 15.8, 22.2 and 24.8 meters, at PA3, PA4 and

PA5 profiles respectively. This finding agrees very well with the interpretation of the reflection 

seismic data from profiles PA3 to PA5, where the interface mean position is placed at 17, 20 

and 23 meters depth, respectively, as seen in figure 4.22. 

 

Figure 4.22 – Refraction interpretation of the reflection seismic data from profiles PA3 to PA5. 

Interface letters represent emerging rays from the respective surface shot. P-wave velocities are 

indicated for each layer. Also shown are the locations of the VES and TEM soundings over the 

seismic profiles. (Adapted from Carvalho et al., 2006). 

 

 

With these few seismic P-wave velocity values, it’s impossible to properly quantify the 

relationship between velocity to electric resistivity relation, as stated e.g. by Meju et al. 

(2003) and references therein. The common link is that resistivity and velocity are both 

functions of porosity. At present situation, one can conclude that the resistivity is more 

uniform in shallow layers than in the deeper one. These resistivity values of the deepest layer 

decrease from profile PA3 (east) to profile PA5 (west side), along with increasing deep. The 

explanation is a change of the stratigraphic unit parameters from east to west, namely the 

clay content, having upper layers higher porosity. TEM method performs a volumetric 

integration response and it smoothes all the small-scale and small contrast geologic 

variations. As a consequence, the perfect match between TEM models and seismic data is 

not achieved. The latter is only affected by ray path and lateral velocity variations.

4.3 – TEM versus VES comparison 
 

The models from VES and TEM soundings are roughly the same, although with few 

differences, especially between profiles, as exposed in tables 4.4 and 4.8 .VES gives better 

solution to the very shallow first layers, and TEM a better resolution to the small variations 

between low resistivity layers. Figure 4.23 shows the resistivity cross-section and figure 4.24 

the side by side collocated VES and TEM models. 

 

Profile PA3 - Both models give similar resistivity values for the bottom layer. The major 

differences are at the thickness of two first layers (as stated before) and VES third layer 

depth interface position which is approximately in the middle of the fourth TEM layer. The 

resistivity of the third VES layer matches that one calculated from TEM data for the third 

layer at most of the sites. 

 

Profile PA4 - At this profile the same pattern is seen, but resistivity values seem to be 

somewhat shifted. 

 

Profile PA5 - The major difference between this profile and the previous two profiles is that 

the interface position of the third layer calculated from VES is approximately the same of 

fourth TEM layer. This has to do with resistivity contrast between third and fourth TEM layers, 

as fourth layer resistivity value is in-between more resistive upper and lower layers.

It seems clear that over this geologic sedimentary environment, with high conductive electric 

layers, TEM method as the ability to detect interfaces between layers with small contrast very 

near the surface (at half one of the loop sides). Closer to the surface, where the loop is laid 

down, the method detects low resistivity layers, but it’s impossible to ascribe a correct 

thickness to them. These findings are in accordance with technical descriptions and 

specifications of TEM-FAST 48. Equipment’s manual states that investigation depth, with an 

L side square single loop, ranges from L/10 to 3L below the surface (AEMR, 2006). With a 

loop 50 m × 50 m this will correspond from 5 m to 150 m. 

 

The upper limit it’s confirmed with this test data. If a better resolution is intended at the 

shallow surface, we have just to decrease the loop size. 

 

The lower limit is not fulfilled although the last layer’s model (sixth layer) is within the 

“theoretical limit”. However, the last data points’ quality does not clearly support it. That can 

be explained by the loop low magnetic moment input signal. Loop’s current stays always 

around 1,4 A, below the possible equipment’s maximum of 4 A. Being so, the lower limit is in 

the L to 2L range at present situation test. 

 

 

4.3.1 – Resistivity static shift 
 

The DC resistivity method values could be affected by an offset, called electric static shift (or 

galvanic distortion). This is due to the presence of small-scale heterogeneities, near the 

ground surface at the sounding place. The result is a distorted or shifted curve (e.g. Barker 

1981; Bahr 1991; Spitzer 2001) and that must be (when possible) accounted before 

interpretation. If not, it will lead to erroneous interpretations, especially at resistivity values. 

 

To have the quantitative static shift value, a scaling relationship between the spatial (VES) 

and temporal (TEM) sounding configurations must be applied. That relation is given by Meju 

(2005), as: 

 

     ? ? ????? 2?      (4.1a) 
 
or 
 

     ? ? 711,8???     (4.1b) 
 

with t the transient time (in seconds) and L the one-half electrode-array length (AB/2). 

Material’s magnetic permeability is taken to be equal to that of free-space. 

 

Those relations were applied to collocated VES and TEM data, as plotted at figure 4.25. As it 

can be seen, most of the VES soundings present any or meaningless static shift, namely at 

profile PA3, but several ones are notoriously shifted against the TEM data scaled values. 

Contiguous VES 5 and 1 at profile PA4, and also contiguous VES 3, 4 and 5 at profile PA5 

exhibit an upper and non negligible shift.

et al., 2010) are very similar to the 1D model inversions, which proven the validity of both 

inversion algorithms.

ELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP 

 

On this fifth chapter, the relations between the measured geophysical data, namely the 

resistivity and the hydrogeological properties of rocks, soils and groundwater chemical 

characteristics is studied. 

 

 

5.1 – Introduction 
 

To be useful, the geophysical data, most times acquired at the surface, must be correlated 

with subsurface properties. That’s the main goal of most hydrogeophysical studies. 

Estimation of subsurface porosity and hydraulic conductivity is often the primary objective at 

water-saturated environments. The usual difficulty arises by the fact that hydraulic 

conductivity at geologic formations can span’s orders of magnitude over relatively small 

spatial scales. It is then a challenge to accurately characterize the subsurface aquifer 

properties by just working piecewise information from networks of widely spaced boreholes 

or at worse cases only a few ones. 

 

A more accurate and complete underground characterization can be achieved by using an 

integrated exploration approach in which wells, boreholes and geophysical data sets are 

interpreted together. The necessary key step is the transformation of measured geophysical 

properties into the desired hydrogeological parameters, not only qualitatively but especially 

quantitatively. This conversion typically relies on petrophysical relationships. These 

relationships can be developed at the field-scale level, by co-located hydrogeological-

geophysical data sets or through laboratory experimentation over rock and soil samples. It 

can come also from theoretically based models. 

 

However, even with joint analyses, the generic hydrogeophysical site characterization can be 

a difficult problem. The subsurface geology may contain much localized features such as 

weathered areas, bedding planes, bedrock, faults, joints and fracture zones, in addition to 

continuously distributed textural and composite variations. This gives rise to an expected 

multiscale complexity, and the geological medium can be viewed like a discrete hierarchy 

(Vogel et al., 2002), were different length scales possess different patterns of spatial 

variability and correlation or like a fractal (Mandelbrot, 1988), in which each length scale 

possesses a similar pattern of spatial variability and correlation. The corresponding 

spatiotemporal response by EM controlled source over a discrete hierarchical or fractal 

geological medium is surely a complicated one, characterized by some broadband, power-

law spatial wave number spectrum (Everett and Weiss, 2002).  

 

The behaviour of the different geological scale, affects most of the measured hydrogeologic 

property’ values, principally the hydraulic conductivity (Neuman, 1994; Winter and 

Tartakovsky, 2001). This important parameter increase to increasing measurement scale, as 

seen in figure 5.1. At Basin-scale, the hydraulic conductivity estimates are often one to two 

orders of magnitude higher than aquifer pumping test determinations, which by turn are 



ELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP 
_____________________________________________

larger than laboratory measurements on core samples of the same aquifer material. The 

electric conductivity (EC) like the hydraulic conductivity are both transport properties of the 

geological medium. They depend on geometric parameters at many length scales, such as 

the fracture’s networks connectivity and the tortuous microstructure of the pore space. Thus, 

EC should also exhibit similar scale effect. Field-based studies on these subjects are scarce 

(Purvance and Andricevic, 2000). 

Figure 5.1 - Dependence of hydraulic conductivity with measurement scale, 

(modified after Person et al., 1996). 

 

The geophysical electromagnetic field data, acquired by different methods, can provide high-

resolution information about underground conditions. Both the structural and the electrical 

property information, by spatial mapping, can provide important models constraints to 

hydrogeology. Structural geometric information can be used to define and delineate 

hydrostratigraphic units as well as the locations of fractures and faults. The EC values are 

used to qualitatively characterize the rock and soil type as well as the pore fluid properties 

estimation. Petrophysical models can often be used to make quantitative predictions about 

the rock and soil properties, such as water content, water conductivity, porosity, clay content 

and hydraulic conductivity. 

 

These petrophysical models of the EC and hydrogeological properties of rocks and soils are 

usually formulated in terms of intrinsic properties of the geological material, like pore and 

grain topology and of the chemical and physical properties of the pore fluids. Relationships 

are often non-unique, even with some common controlling factors. The use of multiple 

source data can be used to constrain results, knowing, for instance, the pore fluid 

conductivity, porosity, and other relevant geological information. In general several 

simplifications have to be done before empirical relationship’s application between the 

hydrogeological and electrical properties. These empirical relations are typically based on 

correlations made between the electrical and hydrogeological measured data from a specific 

site. The problem with these empirically relations between electrical and hydraulic 

parameters, is that they often work reasonably well only to the specific study site or to sites 

with similar characteristics (e.g., Huntley, 1986; Purvance and Andricevic, 2000).

5.2 – Hydrological and electrical properties 
 

The most important and relevant parameters used to characterize the aquifer and fluid 

behaviour, that are usually estimated from or measured in the fields collected data are next 

described. 

 

5.1.1 – Hydrological properties 
 

The underground soil and the rocks are composed by solid mineral grains and the 

corresponding pore space. The porosity (?) is defined as the ratio of pore volume (or non 

solid space of soil) (Vp) to the total volume of the sample (Vt). A distinction has to be given in 

the materials who contain isolated (not connect) pores. In these cases, the effective (open) 

porosity of the connected pore space is less than the total porosity. Fractured systems like 

some basaltic ones can be seen (at-large scale) as a porous medium, although geometry of 

pore space is rather different from a common sand or sandstone aquifer system. The 

porosity associated to this fractured system is considered as a secondary porosity overlaying 

the primary pore space network, and can surpass primary one. Table 5.1 gives measured 

range porosity values for most geologic environments, collected from several literature 

sources.

In saturated media, from where most data concerns, the rate of fluid flow through porous 

materials is controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K). For homogeneous and 

isotropic materials, K (in m.s
-1
) is given by (e.g., Fetter, 2001): 

 

     ? ? ??

with; ks the hydraulic permeability (m
2
), g the gravity acceleration (m.s

-2
), ?w the fluid density 

(kg.m
-3
) and µ the fluid dynamic viscosity (Pa.s). 

 

The flow rate is proportional to K and to the hydraulic gradient through classical Darcy’s 

relation, for laminar flow. The range of values for the hydraulic conductivity is given below in 

table 5.2.

The traditional (empirical) expressions to predict hydraulic permeability of saturated sands 

from just particle grain size was formulated by the end of XIX century, e.g. Seelheim (1880) 

and Hazen (1895) (Matthess and Ubell 2003). Both are power law based expressions. The 

Hazen original formulation (K in cm.s
-1
) is given by: 

 

      ? ? 	
??
?     (5.2) 
 

with CH the Hazen empirical coefficient and D10 the particle size for witch 10 % are finer (in 

cm). Published value of CH ranges from 1 to 1,000 and Hazen formula’s applicability is 

generally limited to 0.01 &amp;lt;D10 &amp;lt;0.3 cm (Hazen 1892, 1911; Holtz and Kovacs 1981; Coduto 

1999). 

 

Many variants of this power law had been establish, most of them having exponent values in 

the 1.10 to 2.05 range, with most values significantly less than 2 (e.g. Shepherd, 1989). All 

these empirical formulations are less accurate when compared with latter developed semi-

empirical and semi-theoretical expressions (Carrier, 2003). As the hydraulic permeability, is a 

function of the existing pore size distribution, they connectivity and tortuosity of pore network. 

In granular materials, the topology of the pore space is given by the grain size distribution, 

their packing and cementation. 
  



ELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP 
_____________________________________________ 

 91

The formulations of hydraulic permeability models can either be in terms of the pore space 

characteristics or in terms of the solid mineral grains (e.g., Nelson, 1994). The equivalent 

channel fundamental model developed by Kozeny (1928) and Carman (1937), known as K-C 

model, assumes that flow through a porous medium can be represented by the flow through 

a bundle of capillaries (Carman, 1939). Each of this capillary is assumed to represent an 

independent flow path through the medium. The fractured mediums can act and can be 

thought accordingly. The effective path length (La) is greater than (or equal) to the 

macroscopic sample length (L). The tortuosity (T) is defined as the square of effective path 

length to sample length ratio. The relation between these parameters is given and follows 

experimental considerations of laminar viscous flow through tubes, (e.g., Scheidegger, 

1974); 

 

     ?? ?
????
??      (5.3) 

 

with; rh the effective hydraulic radius (in m) and ? the tube shape or form factor (a 
dimensionless number between 1.7 and 3.0). ? is porosity. 
 

The more common indication of the hydraulic radius is given by reciprocal of the specific 

surface area (Sp) (in m
-1
), the ratio of pore inner surface area to its volume. Furthermore, the 

defined tortuosity can be related to electrical (resistivity) formation factor (F) through the 

following relationship (e.g., Nelson, 1994); 

 

      ? ? ???? ?

were ?w and ?b are the fluid and system bulk EC (?w and ?b the corresponding resistivity 

values), respectively. It is a purely geometric parameter, describing how the porous medium 

obstructs transport processes. Thus, it is often assumed to be an indicator of the hydraulic 

tortuosity (Archie, 1942). It is detailed further on this chapter. Table 5.3 presents the range 

value of the formation factor of several media.

The K-C equation (5.3) is more practical when expressed like: 

 

     ?? ?
?

?!?"?
? ???

?

??      (5.6) 

 

because the F and Sp are well-defined physical parameters that can be measured, whereas 

T and rh are theoretical ones that cannot be directly measured. 

 

More relationships like those ones expressed by equations (5.1) and (5.6) have been 

identified and also updated by many authors. Relationships between porosity and hydraulic 

properties are usually proposed by semi-log and log-log regression’s analyses with physical 

basis in a set of geometric and hydrodynamic considerations. Those correlations were 

obtained empirically, often aided by dimensional analysis and theoretical considerations, and 

are known as phenomenological models (Dullien, 1979). Those relationships with hydraulic 

properties include particle’s dependence on pore sizes for both mean values as well as the 

entire distribution of values. At grain-scale permeability, models can predict ks to be 

dependent and function of the square of an effective grain size and grain sorting, (e.g., 

Fetter, 2001). Those based on particle size are typically empirical or phenomenological, 

while the models based on pore sizes more often include assumptions regarding pore 

structure, shape, connectivity (or tortuosity). A rather complete list of these relationships is 

given by Flint and Selker (2003). A common and generalized applied expression is the one 

from Georgi and Menger (1994);

All these K-C models, often called hydraulic radius theory, are closest to a geometric model 

because assumptions on pore structure are made, whereas a purely phenomenological 

theory based on empirical tests often makes no such assumptions. When particles deviate 

strongly from spherical, broad particle size distribution, the K-C model often gave worse 

results. The disagreement’s reasons between ks predictions and experimental values are 

primarily due to the fact that natural porous mediums are not composed of well-connected, 

tubular flow conduits, or constant-diameter pores, which is the basis for many of the theories 

and proposed models. The empirical coefficients are introduced to account for the following 

situations. Anomalously high tortuosity (in high porosity media), the assumption of conduit 

flow is rather and more appropriately a ‘‘flow around submerged objects’’. The friction drag 

mechanisms are dominant over viscous shear mechanisms that determine the friction in 

conduit flow. If pores of different sizes are present and operate in parallel, the ks is 

dominated by the largest pores rather than if all pores had the same diameter. If pores of 

different sizes are operating serially, the sequential variation in the effective cross-section of 

flow channels tends to result in a ks linked with the smaller cross section. These two last

assumptions operate oppositely, and there may be some cancellation effects in a porous 

medium (Flint and Selker, 2003). 

 

Better results are expected when knowledge of tortuosity is introduced. Pape et al. (1987) 

had shown that tortuosity behaves as a fractal and depends on the effective radius of pore to 

grain radius ratio relation (rh/rgrain) with an exponent involving the fractal dimension (D) of 

media. Tortuosity increases with increasing fractal dimension in the range of 2.0 &amp;lt;D &amp;lt;2.4. 

Strongly fractured and claystones rocks show a fractal dimension in the range of 2.4 &amp;lt;D &amp;lt;

3.0. These later rocks are characterized by a high degree of connectivity of the pore space 

system, which in turn reduces their tortuosity (Pape and Schopper, 1988). 

 

 

5.1.2 – Electrical properties 
 

The observed and measured electric conductivity of soils and rocks is essentially a function 

of the: water (electrolyte) content, the conductivity of the electrolyte saturated solution and 

the lithology. The electrical conductivity of aqueous solution increases with the concentration, 

mobility and electronic charge of the ions in the solution, as well as with the temperature of 

the solution. Considering pure water, it has a relatively very low electrical conductivity of 

about 0.04 µS.cm
-1
 (or 250000 ?.m electric resistivity) (Weast, 1983). The conductivity of 

natural groundwater with dissolved salts and other ionic components is much larger. The 

pore water conductivities range from about 100 µS.cm
-1
 (100 ?.m) for freshwater aquifers to 

200000 µS.cm
-1
 (0.05 ?.m) for oil field brines (e.g., Schön, 1996) being the seawater EC 

around 50000 µS.cm
-1
 (0.2 ?.m). Thus, groundwater EC value can give us directly the quality 

condition. That is, the salt content amount, as described later on. Table 5.4 shows the range 

of EC values for several waters found in nature.

The EC of an aqueous solution containing m ionic component is given by the following 

expression, valid for low salt concentrations, when ion-ion interactions can be neglected: 

 

     +, ? ? ./0/1/2/3/4?     (5.8)

components, the hydroxide (OH

The EC temperature dependence of the electrolyte is almost entirely due to the liquid 

viscosity temperature dependence, which in turn affects directly the ionic mobility of water 

components and the degree of dissociation (Lesmes and Friedman, 2005). 

 

The observed and measured EC variations with temperature are approximately linear over 

the range of normal ambient temperatures. Temperature dependence of pure Sodium 

Chloride (NaCl) solutions has been studied and described by several authors (e.g., Arps, 

1953; Worthington et al., 1990). They empirical equations gave a slope temperature 

coefficient variation of 0.022 °C
-1
. This value is also valid for other ions. For natural waters, 

the actual slope value is very similar. That is, around a mean value of 0.019 °C
-1
 (Hayashi, 

M., 2004). Thus, the electrolyte groundwater conductivity for a temperature other than 

standard can be computed by: 

 

    +,$?&amp;amp; ? +?561 8 0,020$? &amp;lt;25&amp;amp;&gt;   (5.9) 
 

were +?5 is the water solute EC value at standard 25 °C. 
 



ELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP 
_____________________________________________ 

 95

This means a 2.0% EC change per Celsius degree and a doubling EC value with a 50 °C 

temperature increase. A groundwater aquifer system with a temperature variation of just a 

couple of degrees throughout the year exhibits only a minor EC temperature induced 

variation. 
 

Empirical relationships also exit relating EC of aqueous solutions to the total dissolved solids 

(TDS) content (e.g., Fishman and Friedman, 1989); 

 

     +, ? @ A TDS     (5.10) 
 

with water EC unit in µS.cm
-1
 and TDS in mg.L

-1
. 

 

Depending on ionic composition of water solution the constant ? can ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 

(at normal ambient temperatures). The average value for ? is 1.5, usually applied to predict 

the electric conductivity of natural waters at 25 °C (Fishman and Friedman, 1989). 

 

The major salt component of seawater is NaCl with an 85.6% total salt mass content (salinity 

of 35). In figure 5.2 the EC (and resistivity) dependence with NaCl mass concentration is 

shown. 

Figure 5.2 – Sodium Chloride concentration versus EC, at 20 °C, (after Worthington et al., 1990). 

 

The effective shape of the grains (or pores) and orientation also affects the conductivity 

response. Solid matrix surface conductivity at the grain interface can have a significant 

importance in fine-grained materials, especially when solution conductivity is low. In this 

case, the surface conductivity models are dependent on the amount of surface area and the 

surface chemical properties of the solid to liquid interface (Lesmes and Friedman, 2005). 

 

If the water solution conductivity is known, for instance, from field borehole measures, 

electrical conductivity measurements can be used to estimate the effective porosity of water-

saturated formations or the water content of partially saturated formations. The most widely 

used relationship to predict the effective electrical conductivity response of water-saturated 

geological materials is the famous Archie’s empirical 1
st
 equation (Archie, 1942), or the 

modified version to under-saturated formations, 2
nd

 equation. Although being an empirically 



ELECTRICAL-HYDROGEOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP 
_____________________________________________ 

 96

based expression, it has been also derived from a fractal model for porous rocks by Pape 

and Schopper (1988) and Shashwati and Tarafdar (1997). 
 

The empirical Archie’s law (1
st
 equation) is expressed by: 

 

      +, ? E+F?%3    (5.11a) 
or 

      ? ? E?%3    (5.11b) 
 

linking the porosity to formation factor. The constant E, named tortuosity factor (or lithology 
coefficient) it’s applied to correct and account for variation in compaction, pore structure and 

grain size of the sample. Tortuosity factor varies in the range 0.5 to 2.0 (Serra, 1984). Archie 

found that exponent m ranges from 1.3 for unconsolidated sand to 1.8-2.0 for consolidated 

sandstones, naming this parameter as the cementation index. 

 

Table 5.8 resumes some measured cementation index values for several materials and rocks 

found in published literature (e.g., Stefansson et al., 1982; Lesmes and Friedman, 2005). 

Experimental measures and theoretically derived petrophysical models, relate this 

cementation index to the effective grain shape. The index increases as the grains became 

less round (spherical), but keeps almost unchanged to variations in grain size and sorting 

(Jackson et al., 1978). 

 

Table 5.8 – Archie’s cementation index parameter for several medium. 

(after Lesmes and Friedman, 2005) 

Geologic medium / material Cementation index m 

Clean sand 1.3 

Consolidated sandstone 1.6 - 2.0 

Shaley sand 1.52 

Quartz sand  1.44 

Limestone 1.9 - 2.3 

Fractured basalt 1.0 

Glass beads (spheres) 1.20 - 1.38 

Prisms 1.63 

Cylinders, Cubes 1.47 

Disks  1.46 

 

This Archie’s law implicitly assumes that the effective porosity and total porosity are equal, 

and that all electrical conduction in a water-saturated rock or soil results from the ion’s 

migration in the bulk pore-solution. If there are non interconnected pores through which ions 

cannot migrate, then Archie’s relation will be over predicting electric conductivity. 

 

As stated before, in fine-grained materials or at saturated materials with resistive pore 

solutions, surface conduction can be of a significant amount, causing Archie’s law to under 

predict the EC. That’s the situation when clay minerals are present due to clay's structure 

and cation exchange capacity. This means that the formation factor as defined by expression 

(5.5) is strictly valid only to a certain class of petrophysically rocks (Archie rocks). Formation

factor is known as the apparent formation factor when it varies with solute EC, temperature 

and ion type solution. Archie’s 1
st
 equation has been modified to include this surface 

conduction term (+?) in parallel with the bulk conduction term, which results from the 
migration of ions through the bulk pore solution (e.g., Schön, 1996) and also to be applied 

under unsaturated areas (2
nd

 equation): 

 

      +F ?
??
! G,

H 8 +?   (5.12) 
 

with G, the saturation index of material, n the saturation exponent value, usually close to 2. 
Departures from this value are variously attributed to the influence of wettability and nature of 

desaturating fluid (Schön, 1996). 

 

Although not being expected that bulk and surface conduction mechanisms act strictly in 

parallel (e.g., Friedman, 1998), the simple parallel-conduction model consideration has 

several practical advantages. One is that differentiation, and estimation can easily be done 

between F and +? by analysis of the plot +F versus +, (e.g., Waxman and Smits, 1968; 
Nadler, 1982). 

 

The effects of lithology and solution chemistry on the surface conductivity term in (5.12) were 

introduced and accounted for by Waxman and Smits (1968), (W-S models) like: 
 

     +? ?
IJK
?      (5.13) 

 

where JL is the cation exchange capacity (CEC) per unit pore volume, a measure of the 
effective clay content, and B the equivalent ionic conductance of the clay exchange cations. 

 

Waxman and Smits empirically obtained formulas for the dependence of B on the solution 

conductivity. Sen et al. (1988) developed one version in which the empirical parameter B is a 

function of; the solution conductivity (in µS.cm
-1
) and also the cementation index (m). 

 

     I ? ?,MN3?OP


 ???      (5.14) 
 

The advantage of this Sen et al. formulation (based upon saline solutions) is that it accounts 

for lithologic effects on the surface conductivity response. However, the empirical parameters 

at expression (5.14) are still dependent upon the solution type. The JL value can be 
expressed by: 

     JL ?
 R?S$?%?&amp;amp;

? A CEC    (5.15) 
 

with V3WX the material matrix density. 
 

Ground and soils CEC range values are naturally linked to the clay mineral composition. The 

critical parameter for conductivity of clayey material is thus not the clay content, but is CEC 

value (Kirsch, 2006). CEC unit is usually provided as milliequivalent of hydrogen per 100 g 

(meq
+
/100g), Many such values have been measured and are listed, for example; Kaolinite 

(3 to 15 meq
+
/100 g), Chlorite (10 to 40 meq

+
/100 g) or Volclay Bentonite (80 meq

+
/100 g).

SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS 

 
On this sixth chapter, the principal settings of Santiago Island (Cape Verde) are given, 
namely the geology, climatology, hydrogeology and hydrochemistry ones. 
 
 
6.1 – Santiago island location 
 
Santiago Island belongs to the Cape Verde archipelago. It is the southernmost archipelago of 
the Macaronesia system, at the North Atlantic Ocean. Santiago is the biggest of the ten 
major islands, five smaller desert islands and several islets, composing the Cape Verde 
archipelago. The major town and capital of the country, Praia, is located in the southern side 
of the island. Praia had 100000 inhabitants and total island’s populations were 235000, 
according to the last population’s CENSOS (INE, 2000). This CENSOS also indicates a total 
432000 inhabitant in the archipelago. 
 
Cape Verde is a volcanic archipelago located at the eastern north Atlantic border 450 km 
from Africa western coast of Senegal and 1400 km south-south-west from the Spanish 
Canary island’s archipelago, at the Sahel region. It is limited by north parallels 14º 48’ and 
17° 13’, and by the west meridians 22° 42’ and 25° 22’. The archipelago is divided into three 
sectors; the north one, the western one and the eastern and south one. Santiago belongs to 
this latter and it’s located between 14º 54’ and 15º 20’ north latitudes and between 23º 48’ e 
23º 27’ west longitudes. Total Isle surface is 991 km2 with a maximum length of 54.9 km by 
28.8 km maximum wide, north-west to a south-east oriented (figure 6.1). The island summit 
is 1394 meters above mean sea level and is the third highest island of the archipelago.

6.1.1 – Geologic regional settlement 
 
The Cape Verde archipelago is an emerged portion of a Mesozoic-Cenozoic volcanic 
accretion in the form of a westward-facing horseshoe along fracture zones converging from 
the mid-Atlantic ridge toward Africa (figure 6.2). The interior abyssal plain slopes westward, 
increasing in depth from 2.7 to 4.5 km (Duprat et al., 2007). The archipelago is located on the 
southwestern part of the Cape Verde Rise, a swell about 2.2 km high and 1400 to1600 km 
wide that is considered the largest oceanic intra-plate bathymetric anomaly (Lodge and 
Helffrich, 2006). Islands stand on 120 to 140 Million years (Ma) old (Williams et al., 1990, 
Müller et al., 2008) and about 85 km thick (Cazenave et al., 1988) oceanic lithosphere. The 
crustal thickness is anomalously high beneath the islands (reaching 22 km), but have a 
normal 7 km between them (Lancelot, Y. and Seibold, E., 1977, Ali M. Y. et al., 2003; Lodge 
and Helffrich, 2006; Pim J. et al., 2008). 
 
An important residual geoid gravimetric and heat flow anomaly is present (Dash et al., 1976; 
Courtney and White, 1986). These features are believed to result from mantle plumes 
(Sleep, 1990). The Cape Verde genesis from a deeply anchored mantle plume seems to be 
supported by seismic tomography studies (Montelli et al., 2006; Zhao, 2007) and by He 
isotope signatures obtained both from silicate and carbonatitic rocks (Christensen et al., 
2001, Doucelance et al., 2003, Mourão et al., 2007, Mata et al., 2010). This underneath 
plume explains the observed volcanic activity and the associated geothermal anomalies. Off-
shore seismic refraction line’s results indicate a 2 to 3 km of semi consolidated sediments 
underlining a 3 to 6 km of basalt and 6 to 8 km of plutonic rocks (Duprat et al., 2007).

The archipelago island’s formation as been linked to a hotspot mechanism (Holm et al., 
2008) and the oldest published date for the Cape Verde hotspot (about 26 Ma) was obtained 
for a submarine basalt from the basal complex of the Sal Island (Torres el al., 2002). 
 
The island’s formation had begun with an initial underwater volcanic core, lately completed 
by a network of small-scale faults, seen at the outcrops (Serralheiro, 1976a, Alves et al., 
1979). All the region have been subjected to important vertical movements (De Paepe et al., 
1974; Gerlach et al., 1988; Millet et al., 2008) with measured values in the 0.2 to 0.4 mm per 
year range (Madeira et al., 2010, Ramalho et al., 2010a and b). 
 
Though Cape Verde's islands are all volcanic in origin, they show a widely variety of terrain 
and geomorphology aspect. The first geological report and account study was from Charles 
Darwin’s epic voyage at the "Beagle” (Darwin, 1844). The following geology report of these 
islands (except Fogo one) comes with Bebiano (1932) monograph. A comprehensive and 
detailed description of these early works can be found from Mitchell-Thomé (1972 and 1976) 
respective article and book and references therein. 
 
The archipelago islands are principally composed of igneous rocks, with basic volcanic and 
pyroclastics comprising the majority of the total volume (Bebiano, 1932). The archipelago is 
an example of a soda-alkaline petrographic province, with a petrologic succession which is 
similar to that found in other mid Atlantic islands of the Macaronesia system. The archipelago 
currently exposed volcanic sequences ranging from the Miocene to the present (Madeira et 
al., 2010). Some islands are flat with just small elevations, like Sal (406 m high) and Maio 
(436 m). Others have relatively high central mountains, like Fogo (2829 m), Santo Antão 
(1978 m), Santiago (1394 m) and São Nicolau (1304 m). 
 
 
6.2 – Santiago geology 
 
The most ancient Cape Verde archipelago formations are from Mesozoic era (late Jurassic 
and early Cretaceous periods), found at island of Maio (Rigassi, 1975, Serralheiro, 1976a, 
Alves et al., 1979). Santiago’s formation is slightly posterior and like all other islands, has 
borne from a central volcanic system. The principal island and the main structure were 
created by several times stages episodes, with a changing volcanic activity rate. At low 
volcanic activity periods, erosion took place. Lately, the eroded valleys have been again 
refilled with new basaltic flows. The oriented axe of Santiago seems to be related to an 
overtime volcanic activity migration. 
 
 
6.2.1 – Volcanostatigraphic: a brief description 
 
Eruptive rocks are the dominant in Santiago, responsible for the building of is morphology. 
Sedimentary formations do exist at several small portion areas. Metamorphic rocks are 
almost inexistent (Serralheiro, 1976a). Santiago’s geologic map was done by Serralheiro 
(1976b), at a 1:25000 scale. The 1:100000 scale map was published one year later

Serralheiro (1977). After this, Matos Alves team did the petrologic and volcanologic study, in 
connection and linked to the other islands (Alves et al., 1979). 
 
Serralheiro assigned several important historical evolution stages at Santiago Island: 
 
First Stage – Palaeogene (65 to 23 Ma) 
The initial undersea water eruptions take place followed by the aerial emersion of the 
volcanism. This stage created the ancient internal eruptive complex. 
 
Second Stage – Palaeogene to Neogene (Oligocene to lower Miocene epochs, 36 to 20 Ma) 
Lower volcanic activity with hard erosive action takes place, with destruction of previous 
superficial volcanic systems. Large underwater deposits have been originated with those 
eroded materials. 
 
Third Stage – Neogene (Lower Miocene epoch, 20 to 16 Ma) 
Seamount stage takes place. Rise of the sea level above the 450 m actual mark. 
 
Fourth Stage – Neogene (Middle Miocene epoch, 16 to 12 Ma) 
Very intense extrusive activity along with great extends of land covert areas. This 
corresponds to “Flamengos Formation”. At present days only the submarine facies is known. 
 
Fifth Stage – Neogene (Middle to upper Miocene epochs, 12 to 5 Ma) 
Regression period to a level not smaller than 250 m high takes place. Break off volcanic 
activity and thick sedimentary deposits formation with marine and terrestrial facies. This 
corresponds to “Órgãos Formation”. 
 
Sixth Stage – Neogene to Quaternary (5 Ma to present) 
Before the last extrusive period, the generalized erosion and sedimentation process give 
raises to dune and beach deposits some tens of meters above the sea level (Plistocene 
epoch). Last volcanic activity creates many scoria and pyroclastic cones. At the Halocene 
epoch, the terrestrial deposits are generalized, as like the sand beach one. 
 
The volcano-statigraphic description is summarized at table 5.1, with principal mineralogical 
specimens included (Martins, 2003), following the Serralheiro (1976a) and Matos Alves et al. 
(1979) proposed sequence characterization. Detailed description can be found at those 
authors’ works and also at the recent thesis about the hydrochemistry of the island, by Mota 
Gomes (Gomes, 2007) and António Pina (Pina, 2009). 
 
The X-ray diffraction mineralogical analyses from former authors (Serralheiro, 1976a, Matos 
Alves et al., 1979 and Martins, 2003), revealed similar compositions between the principal 
mineralogical associations, from the different formations on the island. The mineralogy of 
basanits essentially formation is olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase, with small quantities of 
iron and titan oxides. The mineralogy of melanefelinits formations is feldspatoids (nefeline), 
together with olivine, pyroxene and iron and titan oxides.

The brief statigraphic formations’ description is given bellow, from the most ancient to the 
most-recent ones. The corresponding geologic map is plotted at figure 6.3. 
 
I – Internal ancient eruptive complex (CA) 
This is the most ancient rock formation of the island. They are essentially basic dikes and 
fono-traquits, with some silicate granular rock intrusions. It corresponds to the evolutionary 
first stage. They are mostly visible to west-central part of the island, with vertical and near 
vertical dikes, corroborating the central genesis of Santiago. The low permeability and 
productivity of this formation give it a reduced hydrogeologic importance. 
 
II – Pre-“Flamengos” formation conglomerates 
These are conglomeratic formations covering the CA formation (and very alike the 
“Flamengos” formation). They are visible to south, with a small extent. Lower deposits start 
by thin layers and evolve to broad sediments. No assigned hydrogeologic activity exists to 
this formation.

III – “Flamengos” formation (FL) 
This formation covers discordantly the CA formation, and corresponds to basic breeches and 
pyroclastics, with great extent and uniformity, with submarine genesis. It is found all over the 
island except to the north. Formation occurrence is over the 250 m altitude mark. The 
hydrogeologic productivity of this formation is relatively low, except at the areas where pillow 
lavas do exist, giving then pumping rates over the 20 m3.h-1. This formation corresponds to 
evolutionary fourth stage. 
 
IV – “Órgãos” formation (CB) 
This formation essentially shows thick basaltic blocks (sharp to round ones) from secondary 
volcanic phenomena. CB formation corresponds to fifth stage of the historical evolution, with 
great extent erosion. It is highly heterogeneous with sand intercalations and purely 
conglomeratic. Deposits can be thick by more than 100 m. Most of this formation outcrop at 
Santiago central region (S. Jorge dos Órgãos) and north and west, to a small extent. This 
formation is packed to a high degree and as no hydrogeologic importance, except at areas 
containing pyroclastics cones and high number veins. 
 
V – Post-“Órgãos” formation 
This formation belongs to post CB traquitic phase, with a limit extent. Its major expression is 
seen at Monte Branco, located at the centre of the island. There are endogenous domes 
greatly disassembled but cutting and metamorphing the old submarine lavas, FL sedimentary 
and CA formation. There is no important assigned hydrogeologic specification to this 
formation. 
 
VI – Pre-“Pico da Antónia” sediments 
This formation shows small sedimentary outcrops, with fossil sandstone-limestone and 
conglomerates. This formation is found at island south locations. With a limited extent, this 
formation has also no hydrogeologic importance. 
 
VII – “Pico da Antónia” complex (PA) 
This is one of the most important geologic formations, filling more than half of the island area, 
spanning over a long time period with a great volumetric content. It is responsible by high-
altitude relief as also the main structural platforms of Santiago. Formation spans’ materials 
from effusive and explosive activities, submarine and terrestrial. Older PA formation does 
exist at the south and southeast (Vailleux et al., 1974) and at the east side (Serralheiro, 
1976a) with a predominant terrestrial facies. Sedimentary layers do exist among magmatic 
events, but it is sometimes difficult to clearly differentiate and identify these episodes 
between locations. This sedimentary stage is more expressive at the north side of Santiago. 
After this initial period, an important erosion process took over followed by a partial 
immersion with substantial submarine emissions. All this process is repeated once more and 
ends with an important explosive phase. Resulting materials have high relative porosity, 
which gives them a good hydrologic productivity – becoming the island most important 
aquifer system.

VIII – “Assomada” formation (A) 
This formation corresponds to a new eruptive period, exclusively terrestrial with basaltic 
facies lava flows and a few pyroclastics, after an important erosive time. Formation is located 
at Santiago’s central west side with large horizontal layers, and has good hydrological 
characteristics. 
 
IX – “Monte das Vacas” formation (MV) 
These formations correspond to island’s last volcanic episodes. The produced pyroclastics 
basaltic cones (tufts and scoria) and small flows through the island, have high porosity ones. 
Although direct MV groundwater exploration is not feasible (formation is very shallow), it has 
an important hydrological roll by leaking to the underling PA formation.

X – Quaternary sedimentary formations 
These recent formations cover 8.5% of the island land total surface, and are mainly formed 
by alluvium, slop or runoff flow deposits, dune sands and maritime beaches at several levels 
to the 100 m elevation mark (Serralheiro, 1976a). They are very important units, especially at 
the major valleys of the east coast island side, with some 40 m thick layers (Vailleux et al., 
1974). Local boreholes and wells provide most of the groundwater to inhabitants and 
especially to land irrigation, as these formation’s soils are the islands suited ones for 
agriculture. These Quaternary formations are plotted at figure 6.4, and match the main and 
principal transient creeks of the island, as they fill most of the eroded valleys.

(modified from Pina (2009)). 
 
6.2.2 – Geomorphology 
 
The morphology of Santiago Island is linked to geology and is the outcome of the 
evolutionary process. It is dominated by steep topographic gradients and eroded valleys. 
There has been assigned seven geomorphologic units, although at some areas, the limit 
between them could be difficult to define. Sub classification as been also assigned to some 
of these units. Detailed geomorphology account can be found at Marques (1987, 1990). 
Location and limits of those units are shown at figure 5.5. The next brief description is based 
on Marques (1990). 
 
I – South volcanic plateau (Achadas Meridionais) 
Unit extension is from Pico da António south side mountain to the coast. It covers roughly 
one-third of the island. It is a PA basaltic flow with tuffs intrusions and having slope’s ranges 
from 2 to 12%.

Units: I - South volcanic plateau, II – Pico da Antónia mountain massif, 

III – Santa Catarina plateau, IV – East side border, V – Malagueta mountain massif, 

VI – Tarrafal plateau, VII – West side border 
 
II – Pico da Antónia mountain massif 
This unit is located at the southwest central part. The highest point is the Pico da Antónia, at 
1392 m. The system is highly eroded with sharp summits. It is almost formed by PA eruptive 
complex and represents the south rim of the last big volcanic crater. Observed slopes have 
more than 25%. It is a natural water recharge system to the island. 
 
III – Santa Catarina plateau 
This plateau is located in the middle of the island, surrounded at south by Pico da Antónia 
mountain, at north by the Serra Malagueta mountain. It is an almost flat area with a mean 
elevation of 500 m. This unit seems to represent the eroded bottom of the volcanic crater that 
as created the PA eruptive complex (Serralheiro, 1976a). 
 
IV – East side border 
This unit extends from São Domingos creek valley, at south, to the São Miguel creek valley, 
at north. All sporadic streams born at Santa Catarina plateau, Pico da Antónia or Malagueta 
mountains, have at the start, high slopes, that decrease to a 7% mean value at halfway 
distance to the coastline. Observed lithologies are tuffs and breccias with lava flows. At 
eroded areas, the succession from the CA, Flamengos, Orgãos and PA formations are seen. 
This unit is completely exposed to predominant northeast trade winds that blow throughout 
the year.  



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS 
___________________________ 

 108

V – Malagueta mountain massif 
This unit is the north rim of the ancient big volcanic crater. The summit is at Serra da 
Malagueta with 1064 m, and is entirely a PA formation. It is between the Tarrafal plateau unit 
(at north) and Santa Catarina plateau (to the south). The mountain exhibits mean slopes of 
25%. It’s north flank is exposed to the predominant northeast trade winds. 
 
VI – Tarrafal plateaux 
It’s the north side unit, with several plateaux between 20 and 300 m high, with gentle mean 
slopes of 4%. This unit is formed by PA formation. The Monte Graciosa is the local higher 
mountain (605 m) formed by fonolits and traquits. At this unit, the areas of Tarrafal and Chão 
Bom are covered by recent flood flow deposits, coming from debris of lava flow erosion. The 
predominant northeast trade winds affect only the northeast side of the unit. 
 
VII – West side border 
This unit is located between the Santa Catarina plateau and the sea, at the west coast. 
Some CA outcrops exist, but PA lava flows and tuffs dominate the landscape as basaltic 
layers of Assomada formation. It is a very arid region with high slopes between 12 and 25%. 
The shoreline is high over the ocean. This region is one of the most naturally eroded of the 
island (and archipelago) with the lowest inhabitant’s density, in contrast to the island east 
side. 
 
6.3 – Santiago climatic settings 
 
The superficial and groundwater dynamics are greatly, if not entirely, connected to the 
geomorphology of the island (Custodio, 1975). Superficial water path is driven by 
topography, as the establishment of water circulation lines and the observed flow regime is 
fully a function of local slopes (Meneses, 1977; Rodrigues F., 1993; Rodrigues C., 1995; 
Azevedo, 1998; Fontes, 1999). But to have water running we need to collect water from the 
atmosphere. Again, the island’s morphology and topography play a key role (figure 6.6). The 
maritime moisture air masses, mostly from the east, interacted with island landscape 
differently. Air masses flowing over the low altitude gentle slopes have a different action than 
upper air masses at the higher mountains and valleys, as rainfall is convective in origin 
(Correia, 1998). Precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) have a strong gradient between 
inland and coastal areas. A major difference exists also between the east and west sides of 
the island (Rodrigues C., 1995; Azevedo, 1998). Landscape flora is also of great importance; 
to the water infiltration process and soil protection, to evapotranspiration and to runoff. 
(Falkland and Custodio, 1991, Rodrigues F., 1993, Meneses, 1993). 
 
Cape Verde is located between the subtropical Atlantic north high pressure (Azores 
anticyclone) and West Africa inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The orientation and 
position of those systems have a great impact over the archipelago (Amaral, 1964). When 
this later atmospheric system is shifted to the south, precipitation drops dramatically when 
the archipelago stays exposed to the northeast dry winds from Sahara desert. The variability 
of the West Africa inter tropical convergence position drives the observed variability of the 
Cape Verde rain amount. Some years the rain amounts can be 2 to 3 plus the mean value. 
Others can be waterless.

Figure 6.6 – Santiago five layers topographic map. 

 
 
6.3.1 – Precipitation 
 
Cape Verde is characterized by two annual main weather conditions; the “wind season” from 
November-December to June-July and the “rain season” from July-August to October-
November, each year – the equatorial monsoon, with July and November the transition 
months between those epochs. Although annual and monthly rainfall amounts in Cape Verde 
are invariably low, daily or storm precipitation values can be very high (Rocha Faria, 1971). 
To quantify the rain amount, there are on the island several measure points (figure 6.7). The 
total amount of meteorological and hydrological stations is nowadays of 17. They had started 
collecting data from 1940 onward, but only less than half have complete time series. They 
belong to Cape Verde’s National Meteorological Intitute (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia e 
Geofísica - INMG). Station’s spatial distribution is not uniform and is smaller than the 
required minimal, necessary in this kind of mountain island (Linacre, 1992), which is one 
station per 25 km2. Island’s west side is badly sampled. 
 
Precipitation time series from 1961 to 2009 yields a 363 mm annual mean value. This 
amount changes greatly from year to year, but especially with altitude and distance to the 
sea. Inland and higher locations are the rainy ones. For instances, the Chão Bom (16 m 
amsl) at extreme north, and Praia Airport (64 m) at extreme south, have annual mean 
precipitation of 197 and 164 mm respectively. At Assomada (462 m) this value is 466 mm 
and at S. Jorge dos Orgãos (310 m) is 430 mm. Higher locations like Serra da Malagueta 
(765 m) has 670 mm. Rainfall intensity is another important factor. Precipitation is not 
uniform all over the “rain season”, with August and September being the rainiest months 



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS

(figure 6.8). Traditionally, there are episodes of high-intensity precipitation with heavy storms. 
Rainfall days range from 3 to 20. For most of the years, 45% of mean annual rain falls on 
very short time periods. It is normal to have at the higher areas 200-300 mm per day after 
these storm events (Mannaerts and Gabriels, 2000), which leads to intense superficial runoff 
water and floods in the creek valleys. Surface water resources exist only on those days. The 
storm episodes have little effect to aquifer’s recharge, but a dramatic impact to the soil, 
producing heavy erosion and destruction at the farmed valleys’ areas. 

Figure 6.7 – Santiago rain gauge, meteorological and hydrological stations location (INMG). 
 

Figure 6.8 – Mean monthly rainfall for some Santiago’s locations (1961-2009), (INMG). 
 
Time rainfall variability can be seen at figure 6.9. Data from five stations is plotted from north 
to south, top to bottom, down the island axis. It’s evident a strong annual variability and that 
lower altitude locations have much less rainfall than higher ones. Mean rainfall spatial 
distribution is given at figure 6.10. Accuracy is limited by stations spatial locations.

6.3.2 – Temperature 
 
Air temperature at Santiago is conditioned by relief exposition and orientation, elevation and 
distance from the sea. From the few available temperature time series, it’s possible to assign 
a annual mean value of 24.2 ºC to the island, with a small amplitude range from 21.0 ºC to 
25.1 ºC. The higher mean temperatures are at stations near the sea at low altitude, Praia 
airport (at south) and Tarrafal (at north) with respectively, 25.2 ºC and 24.7 ºC. At a high 
place such as Assomada, the mean annual value is 21.1 ºC with an amplitude of just 4.6 ºC. 
This last value is roughly the main island amplitude. 

Figure 6.11 – Monthly temperature mean values (1973-2005), (INMG). 



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS 
__________________________ 

 113

All island’s locations have minimum annual temperatures in January-February and maximum 
ones in September. That can be seen from the monthly temperature values, figure 6.11. The 
annual temperature starts rising slowly and steadily from January onward until September’s 
maximum and followed by a fast decline to the minimum. The daily temperature variations 
don’t show large amplitudes, too. The daily minimum is reached at dawn (5 - 6 hour local 
time) and maximum at afternoon (13 - 14 hour local time), as expected. 
 
 
6.3.3 – Relative Humidity 
 
Santiago relative humidity (RH) mean values are always above the 60% mark. That’s 
because for the most part of the time, the island is under a cloudy sky condition. RH time 
series only exist for five meteorological stations. Overlapping data spans only two decades 
(1981 to 2001). The island mean RH value is 74%. Mean minimum value is 68% and 
maximum 79%. The mean value increases and temperature decrease as we go inland to 
high locations. Annual variations are plotted at figure 6.12, for the five meteorological 
stations. 
 

Figure 6.12 – Relative humidity mean annual values (1981-2005), (INMG). 
 
Trough the year, the mean monthly value of RH increases steadily from the minimum in 
March to its maximum value in September and then decreases again, closing the annual 
cycle, in good correlation with the temperature patterns. Monthly values are plotted at figure 
6.13. 
 
The importance of these almost constant RH values on the island, trough the year, is 
considerable. Not only, it reduces the ET amount but also adds water, by “horizontal 
precipitation”, to the high regions of the island. Several studies and experiments have 
measured the total amount of this recharge for the usual 3 km2 foggy area of Santiago, at 
1000 m high. The obtained values range over from 1500 to 3500 m3 per day (Cunha, 1964; 
Juvik, 1988, Sabino, 2004).

6.3.4 – Wind 
 
The wind is one of the most important factors to the island rain amount. The three prevailing 
winds at Santiago are (table 6.2); 
- the northeast trade that blows for most of the year, but brings almost no rainfall yet being 
very wet. They normally produce foggy conditions at high northeast side regions. 
- the dry and hot east that blows from continental Africa at winter months, usually with 
immense dust content. 
- the south and southwest monsoon that blow between July and September, responsible for 
the “rain season”. 

Figure 6.14 – Monthly wind speed mean values (1981-2004), (INMG). 
  



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS 
__________________________ 

 115

The average measured wind speed is higher at the lower and southern regions, enhancing 
ET effect at southern regions. The mean annual value at Praia Airport is 5.8 m.s-1 (at 2 m 
high) and 1.2 m.s-1 at S. Jorge dos Orgãos. The wind speed is almost constant trough the 
year, decreasing from June-July to September-October, at the “rain season”. The monthly 
wind speed values are plotted at figure 6.14, for the five meteorological stations.

6.3.5 – Sunshine 
 
Sunshine at Santiago Island has a mean annual amount of about 7 h per day. Lower regions 
have a higher sun exposition. That is, have more daily hours of clear sky than highlands of 
the island (figure 6.15). Throughout the year, the brightness months are at the springtime 
beginning, with a minimum at the August-September “rain season” (figure 6.16). As happen 
to the temperature, RH and wind speed parameter, the insulation values at Chão Bom (at 
Tarrafal, extreme north) exhibits local topographic effects, probably influenced by the nearby 
Serra da Malagueta.

Figure 6.16 – Monthly sunshine mean values (1973-2001), (INMG). 
 
 
6.3.6 – Soil and vegetation 
 
Most part of Santiago’s soil is volcanic by nature, rocky and thin, with little evolution. They 
are slightly alkaline with low organic matter content, but have altered minerals (Costa, 1995). 
Soil’s field capacity values vary in the range 50 to 200 mm per year (Fernandopullé, 1977) 
and mean infiltration’s rates values vary between the 40 mm per hour at alluvium and 40 to 
80 mm per hour at basalts (BURGEAP, 1974). The wild vegetation is adapted to these 
climatic conditions, and is mainly composed by gramineae, bushes and woody specimens 
like Acacia nilotica. 
 
 
6.3.7 – Evapotranspiration 
 
The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be measured or estimated using several 
methods. Data have been collected by evaporimetric and Piche’s tank. With this available 
data, Pina (2009) reached the following annual PET values, at three different stations, with 
three different methods (table 6.3) 
 

Table 6.3 – Annual PET values (units are in mm), (adapted from Pina (2009)). 
Method Praia Airport S. Jorge Orgãos Serra Malagueta 

Piche tank 1034 939 705 

Penman 1298 714 811 

Thornthwaite 1687 1204 1203 

 
These monthly values are plotted at figure 6.17 (for a mean hydrological year) and show 
increased PET variations at low altitude. At Summer time, the PET values are higher. The 
minimum values occur at winter beginning. Of these three methods, the Penman seems to 
be the closest to reality, and Thornthwaite the less adequate to this climatic characterization.

Figure 6.17 – Monthly rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and real evapotranspiration values 

at three meteorological stations (modified from Pina (2009)). 
 
Data analysis shows a different scenario at all these three stations. In Praia, a low altitude 
and shoreline location, there is no water surplus at any time of the year. The real 
evapotranspiration (RET) is always equal to the precipitation (R). At S. Jorge dos Orgãos, an 
intermediate altitude place, precipitation exceeds the RET only in August and September 
“rain season” months. At Serra da Malagueta, a high-altitude location, precipitation exceeds 
RET trough all “rain season”. These two last locations attain the necessary direct conditions 
to runoff and soil infiltration waters.

6.4 – Santiago recharge 
 
With these climatologically settings, a bioclimatic classification can be assigned to the 
several regions of Santiago, according to their altitude. The corresponding Köppen–Geiger 
(KG) climate classification system is shown in figure 6.18 for Santiago. 
 
I - Arid zone: from shoreline to 200 m altitude. Rainfall is less than 300 mm per year. 
Landscape is covered by herbaceous. KG: BWh 
 
II - Semi-Arid zone: between the 200 m and 400 m high. Rainfall is between the 300 mm to 
400 mm per year. Landscape is covered by herbaceous, like arid zone, but with more 
species. KG: BSh 
 
III - Sub-Humid zone: between the 400 m and 600 m high. Rainfall is between the 400 mm to 
600 mm per year. Landscape is covered by bushes and woody trees. Extreme dry conditions 
are very rare. KG: CWa 
 
IV – Humid zone: above the 600-700 m high. Rainfall is more than 600 mm per year. It never 
reaches a dry condition. KG: CWa

6.4.1 – Recharge value estimation 
 
Studies have been carried on to quantify Santiago’s ground water recharge. Empirical 
methods have been applied (BURGEAP, 1974, Fernandopullé, 1979, Bossher, 1981, 
Dittrich, 1982, BURGEAP, 1983, PNUD, 1992), and also water balance calculations 
(Fernandopullé, 1979, BURGEAP, 1983, PNUD, 1992). The results are not in accordance, 
and express the difficulty to achieve a good estimation with the available data, (table 6.4).

António Pina (2009) has done recent recharge estimation by two different methods; a 
physical - the classical Penman-Grindley soil water balance equation (Penman, 1950, 
Grindley, 1967) and a chemical - the water-saturated zone Chloride budget. 
 
To do that, Pina had measured the total area of bioclimatic zones with recharge abilities, and 
assigned a rainfall value from the most representative weather station at zone. Arid and 
Semi-Arid zone area amounts to 573 km2. Sub-Humid zone area amounts to 152 km2 and 
Humid zone area amounts to 77 km2. The three main hydrogeological units in Santiago have 
been defined from the geological formations, BURGEAP (1974). They are; the Recent Unit - 
Quaternary sedimentary and “Monte das Vacas” formations, the Middle Unit - “Assomada” 
and “Pico da Antónia” eruptive complex formations and the Bottom Unit - Órgãos”, 
“Flamengos” and Internal ancient eruptive complex formations. This last hydrogeology unit 
area wasn’t accounted for, as it has a very low permeability. These units will be detail latter 
on the chapter. 
 
On the first method using the classical balance equation (6.1), the climatologic input 
parameters come from the meteorological station’s data; 
 
     ??? ? ?? ? ????????? ? 	
?    (6.1) 
 
where ??? is the mean recharge value, ?? the mean precipitation, ????????? the mean real 
evapotranspiration and 	
? the mean superficial runoff water. 
 
Penman-Grindley method works better at humid regions where soil never gets dry. At arid 
and semi-arid zones, RET is less then PET and equal to precipitation, which leads to no 
recharge condition. Nevertheless, occasional water recharge can happen with storms and by 
the indirect leaks from high central island areas. Mean superficial runoff water assigned 
values are 50 and 150 mm to III and IV zones, respectively. These values agree with

observations and local inhabitant descriptions about the maximum flood high in-stream 
valleys and time durations after traditional big storm events. 
 
Recharge values are given at table 6.5. Total annual recharge amount with Penman PET 
method is 19 hm3 (9.0% of estimated rainfall) and with Piche’s tank PET method is 27 hm3 
(12.8% of rainfall). These are mean values corresponding to climatological time series 
(average values). Year to year there is recharge variability, mostly driven by rainfall quantity 
and less by temperature, sunshine, humidity and wind speed, more constants over time.

The second method - the water-saturated zone Chloride budget - applies to Chloride 
measures at incoming rain and at groundwater. It was implemented originally at Israel’s 
coastal plains in the 60’ of last century (Eriksson and Khunakasem, 1969). It recently was 
successfully applied at some volcanic islands (Custodio, 1997; Lameli, 2001; Custodio, 
2004). This method assumes that the Chlorine ion is conservative in the system, which has 
vertical flux at recharge area and horizontal flux within aquifer, and that groundwater Chloride 
comes only from rainwater. It is assumed that the Chloride input is constant over the time 
covered by the analyses, and that the groundwater is taken sufficiently deep to prevent 
evaporation. The mean recharge value is given by (e.g. Allison and Hughes, 1978): 
 

     ??? ? ?? ?
??????
???????
?????     (6.2) 
 
where ??? ? is the mean Chloride rainwater concentration, ??? ?? is the mean Chloride dry 
deposition and ??? ? is the groundwater mean Chloride concentration. 
 
Recharge values obtained with this method are given at table 6.6. Total annual recharge 
amount estimated with this chemical method is 40 hm3 (19.0% of rainfall). The volume is 
greater than the one given by the previous method. That’s because the method cannot give 
good recharge estimation at the arid and semi-arid zones. The two method’s results are in 
very good agreement at Sub-Humid and Humid zones. 
 
From these two methods, the estimated average recharge value can be given as 30 ± 10 
hm3 per year. Recharge is necessarily smaller at dry years. But at unusual rainy years, with 
more storm events, superficial runoff increases accordingly preventing high recharge values.

6.5 – Santiago hydrological units 
 
The characterization of the hydrologic system volcanic islands like Santiago is difficult due to 
the observed heterogeneity and complexity of geologic formations. Nevertheless, the 
principal features of the system settings are the volcanism type, size and distance to main 
emission source, tectonic activity, age and non volcanic intruded materials (Custodio, 1986). 
Volcanic Groundwater path in Volcanic Islands is mostly linked to lithology formations. Empty 
spaces within rocks (porosity), vary in volume and shape, frequency and connectivity, being 
responsible by hydraulic properties, especially at most-recent formations (Rodrigues, 2002). 
The basaltic rocks typically have higher permeability (mainly those of acid type), and more 
recent lava flows are also more permeable then ancient flows (Custodio and Llamas, 2001). 
Porosity can range between 10 and 50% in pyroclastics rock type, to less than 5% at heavy 
lavas (Custodio, 1978). Hydrological units at Santiago have been grouped by their common 
formation’s behavior. Data comes from geologic, borehole logging and pumping test’s data 
studies (BURGEAP, 1974). Figure 6.19 shows the spatial distribution of the three main units; 
Bottom, Middle and Recent. 
 
6.5.1 – Bottom Unit 
 
The bottom unit is composed by the internal ancient eruptive complex (CA), the “Flamengos” 
(FL) and “Órgãos” (CB) formations. It is a compact unit, with strong altered outcrops and 
consequently, has a relatively low permeability against more recent units. The top 20 to 30 m 
CA formation are in general fractured and altered, with roughly 5 to 10 % porosity. The 
formation is compact below this layer without any groundwater on it. At this shallow layer, 
boreholes and wells have 5 to 15 m3h-1 productions (8 to 10 hours per day extraction). Mean 
value of transmissivity (T) of this formation range from 0.2 to 5×10-5 m2s-1. The FL formation 
has hydraulic properties similar to those of CA. The exceptions are the pillow lavas’ areas 
where mean production can reach the 20 m3h-1 (10 to 12 hours per day), with small water 
level withdraw. The behaviour of the CB formation is like the others two, with general mean 
production of 5 m3h-1. The Value can be higher than that in CB formation (up to 10 m3h-1) with 
pyroclastics content, dikes and fractures’ presence. This hydrological unit shows high a 
degree of mineralization waters.

6.5.2 – Middle Unit 
 
This unit is composed by “Pico da Antónia” eruptive complex (PA) and Assomada formation 
(A). The PA formation is mainly a structure of basalt (submarine and aerial) with some 
pyroclasts showing some tens of meter’s thickness. This is the main aquifer system, although 
shows a broad permeability, decreasing with depth. With the presence of pillow lavas, the PA 
formation has transmissivity values from 10-1 to 2×10-2 m2s-1. Pumping at these areas can be 
high as 40 m3h-1 (12 or more hours per day). Mean extraction, is, however, of about 3 to 5 
m3h-1 with transmissivity values from 10-4 to 5×10-4 m2s-1. The Assomada formation has also 
some tens of meters, and is located at Assomada plateau. Mean extraction at this formation 
area is 20 to 25 m3h-1 (10 to 12 hours per day), with transmissivity values ranging from 10-4 to 
5×10-4 m2s-1. 
 
6.5.3 – Recent Unit 
 
This unit is composed by the “Monte das Vacas” (MV) formation and by Quaternary alluvium 
deposits. The former is essentially composed by basaltic pyroclastic cones and is extremely 
permeable. They are very important recharge areas liking groundwater to the system 
underneath. At the alluvium formation, hydraulic parameters are a function of grain size, 
thickness and clay content. When these Quaternary formations are thick, coarse and clay 
free, they can present high porosity and permeability values, with transmissivity ranging from

10-1 to 2×10-2 m2s-1. The productive boreholes at the several eastern downstream valleys 
(like Flamengos, Picos, Seca and São Domingos creeks) can reach 40 m3h-1 (12 hours per 
day). Upstream the same valleys, where formation’s thickness is smaller and materials are 
thinner, transmissivities range from 10-4 to 10-5 m2s-1 and the mean extraction rate drops to 8 
m3h-1 (12 hours per day).

6.6 – Santiago watershed points 
 
The number of registered watershed points at Santiago is nowadays more than 3000 
(INGRH). This number comprises natural springs (1199), manmade wells (1074) and 
boreholes (880). First census was done in the 70s of the last century and by end of 1979; the 
watershed points were already 2287. The initial knowledge of the hydrologic parameters 
came from the analyses of those data. With the growing and demanding of population, the 
water resources increasing is almost entirely due to new borehole facilities, at a present-day 
mean rate of ten boreholes by year. Not all this watersheds is still active. Many wells had 
become dry and only seven hundred are useful. The number of working borehole is around 
three hundred. The valuable springs are about to 264, but only 41 have a really important 
water flow rate. To overcome water needs, the Poilão water dam at Seca stream was 
finished by 2008 (Gomes, 2007). It is a medium rainfall catchment structure with an 1.2 hm3 
volume capacity. A few desalinization power plants exist also. Nowadays, 70% of Praia’s 
waters consumption comes from desalinization. 
 
6.6.1 – Springs 
 
Springs are related to geology, especially to fractures and dike’s location. Most of them are 
found at island central plateau, between Pico da Antónia and Serra da Malegueta mountains. 
Springs are found from 3 m to 804 m high, and they have a seasonal variability trough the 
hydrologic year. The most productive springs have a 300 m3 per day mean flow that can be 
higher as 1000 m3 per day after “rain season”. Springs total water flow estimation exceeds 
certainly 5 hm3 reaching perhaps 10 hm3 a year.  



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS

6.6.2 – Wells 
 
Wells are the manmade oldest way to extract water, existing since archipelago occupation. 
Typically, they have 2 to 4 m diameter with 3 to a maximum of 15 m depth. They are settled 
at alluvium formation, and made with stone walls. Most of them are located at the eastern 
side of the island, figure 6.20a), but can also be found at central and higher locations, at 
Bottom Unit basalt fractured layer or receiving water from some perched water body. They 
usually provide small water quantities, between 10 to 15 m3 per day, at Bottom Unit 
formations. At the alluvium that quantity can easily grow to 100 m3 per day. Wells represent a 
water-quality problem as they are extremely vulnerable to contaminations by standing on 
high permeable formations near the shoreline. The over-exploitation and diffuse 
contaminations by human activities are a constant at many locations. 
 
6.6.3 – Boreholes 
 
Boreholes have a more uniform distribution over the island, and have been made from the 
sea level to 700 m high, figure 6.20b). Their location is related to local hydrogeological 
settings and also to sea distance, to prevent seawater intrusion. Boreholes depth varies from 
30 to 270 m, with deeper ones at higher locations. INGRH controls annually 150 boreholes 
that make a groundwater extraction of 4.5 hm3. It is reasonable to consider a maximum total 
amount of 9.0 hm3 by all the 300 operational boreholes on the inland. 

a)                                                                     b) 

Figure 6.20 – Location of active and controlled wells a) and boreholes b), (INGRH). 
 
6.6.4 – Piezometric head 
 
From INGRH water level regular measure’s data set (not covering all databases points, but 
just a couple hundred) it’s possible to map the groundwater piezometric head surface of the 
island.  



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS 
__________________________ 

 125

The analysis of the time evolution of springs discharges, plus the groundwater level at wells 
and boreholes have shown that piezometric level seems to be reasonable continuous all over 
the island. There is a direct, as also an indirect observed seepage (a few months after “rain 
season”). Springs discharge amount can vary a lot after precipitation. Piezometric level 
variations aren’t significant over the last decade, at island scale dimension, (Pina, 2009). The 
piezometric map is presented at figure 6.21, with plotted flow direction, driven by the 
hydraulic gradient, (care must be taken especially at areas where no data exist to support 
krigging interpolation or same outlier data point). From level lines, clearly that the piezometric 
surface follows the topographic one (see figure 6.6) and have the same island axis 
symmetry. Groundwater flows naturally outwards, and drains to gully valleys and sea. 
Hydraulic gradient is higher (around 0.05 m.m-1) at high-altitude locations, and much smaller 
at lower ones (around 0.008 m.m-1). 

Figure 6.21 – Santiago piezometric map, 2004 (INGRH data). 
 
6.6.5 – Conceptual hydrogeologic island model 
 
As described, Santiago (like all Cape Verde islands) has predominantly made by basaltic 
lava flows, interspersed with pyroclastics and breccias and intruded by near-vertical mafic 
dikes. The current conceptual understanding of recent volcanic oceanic island hydrogeology 
is based primarily on Hawaiian studies (Peterson 1972, Macdonald et al., 1983, Oki et al., 
1999, Hildenbrand et al., 2005). On this high topographic relief, shallow soils, and rapid 
runoff or infiltration islands, the conceptual hydrogeologic model consists of a regional low-
gradient water table aquifer with overlying perched and dike-confined groundwater bodies. 
The vertical and steeply dipping intrusive feeder dikes form as magma moves upward 
through both the central caldera and along fissures at volcano’s flank (through pre-existing 



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS 
___________________________

lava flows). These denser and low-permeability intrusive feeder dikes often act as barriers to 
horizontal flow, creating large groundwater reservoirs (Mink, 1963; Peterson, 1972; Jackson 
and Lenat, 1989). At the same time, low-permeability clay layers intercalated with and 
formed by the weathering of the upper surfaces lava flows may also act as hydraulic barriers 
(Barmen et al., 1990). Such horizontal and vertical flow barriers produces perched 
groundwater bodies, the highland springs, and by compartment of groundwater, can create a 
stepped and discontinuous water table (figure 6.22). 

Figure 6.22 – Generalized conceptual model of volcanic islands hydrogeology, 

(modified from Macdonald et al., 1983). 
 
The admitted model for Santiago is that the majority of infiltration and groundwater recharge 
occurs at the highest areas, as they have many times more precipitation than coastal areas, 
high-permeability basalts, and closed-basin calderas (Barmen et al., 1984, 1990; Kallrén and 
Schreiber, 1988). Application of this conceptual model to Santiago Island is compatible with 
the existence of a major groundwater central reservoir at Middle Unit, the PA and Assomada 
formations being the catch area the closed-basin of Santa Catarina plateau (Pina, 2009). The 
reservoir could have a lens shape being thicker in the middle, resting over the much more 
impermeable Bottom Unit, figure 6.23. At this central region, the many intrusive near-vertical 
dikes can create independent groundwater bodies. Groundwater movement at the central 
region is essentially vertical downward, but the many fractures, faults and dikes play a key 
role to the local groundwater path. At lower regions, near the surface the water movement is 
roughly sub-horizontal to the sea, but an upward flow can be present from deeper 
groundwater. 

Figure 6.23 – Santiago conceptual model (modified from Pina (2009)).

The low-density lens shape freshwater reservoir stands over the higher-density brackish and 
saltwater. Under steady-state conditions, the freshwater hydraulic head above sea level 
should be balanced by an approximately 40-fold thickness of fresh water beneath sea level, 
as given by the Ghyben-Herzberg principle. Boundary between fresh and brackish waters 
isn’t even sharp or fixed. It is controlled by pressure and density and is balanced by 
groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge (Peterson 1972). Aquifer drawdown due 
to excessive extraction will lower water levels and move the fresh/brackish water interface 
upward and inland, producing a salt-water intrusion (Gingerich and Oki, 2000). Springs are 
the manifestation of groundwater natural discharge at Santiago. The others are wells and 
boreholes withdrawals, occasional seepage to streams, and shallow water table 
evapotranspiration. Groundwater discharges most probably also includes a sub-surface 
outflow to the ocean. Such submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has been documented 
in other volcanic island sites (Izuka and Gingerich 2003; Hildenbrand et al. 2005; Prada et al. 
2005) and could represent a substantial fraction of total groundwater discharge from the 
island aquifer. 
 
 
6.7 – Santiago hydrochemistry 
 
The properties of groundwater are very limited and piecewise if we just stay at the knowledge 
of water table depth (or the hydraulic head), flow amount, temperature or electric conductivity 
(EC), for instance. With chemical and isotope hydrology, many more parameters data are 
available, allowing the access to the concealed nature of groundwater. 
 
Starting with pure water, it is composed by the most common Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms, 
but also with more rare isotopes, like Deuterium (2H or D) and heavy Oxygen 17O (very rare) 
and 18O. A sample of pure water will be mostly H2O with some heavier rare molecules HDO 
and H2

18O. 
 
Natural water has also dissolved salts, dissociated into cations and anions. The most 
common cations are Sodium (Na+), Calcium (Ca2+), Magnesium (Mg2+) and Potassium (K+). 
The most common anions are Chloride (Cl-), Bicarbonate (HCO3

-), and Sulphate (SO4
2-). 

Water contains also dissolved gases. The major source is the atmosphere with molecular 
Nitrogen (N2), Oxygen (O2), and noble gases; Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton 
(Kr), and Xenon (Xe). Many more can be of biogenic origin, added to the water in the ground, 
like Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S). 
 
Cosmic rays interact with our upper atmosphere and produce a variety of radioactive 
isotopes. Three of them have a special interest to hydrology; Tritium (3H or T) the heaviest 
hydrogen isotope, Carbon-14 (14C), the heaviest isotope of carbon, and Chlorine-36 (36Cl), a 
rare Chlorine isotope. The half-life rate of radioactive decay gives us the time of permanence 
at saturated zone since incorporated into groundwater, and they are 12.32 ± 0.022, 5730 ± 
40 and 301000 ± 4000 years, respectively to Tritium, Carbon and Chlorine radioactive 
isotopes. Those rates allow investigation period values from a few decades, to 25000 years, 
and 100000 to one million years, respectively. All these isotopes have also been produced 
by nuclear bomb tests, providing additional inputs to natural systems (Mazor, 2004). 



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS

Water with all these (and more) components will infiltrate into the ground, and react 
chemically with underground rocks that have minerals and biologic materials. Physical 
factors are also important, for instance, to rock rupture and hence more area available to 
reactions. At Santiago Island, most rocks are basaltic by nature, mostly with siliceous 
minerals. This rock type is extremely favourable to chemical alteration process, like 
dissolution, hydrolyse and oxidation. Not only, rock type, but also the climatic condition, 
water constituents, rock-water interaction time and soil existence are factors that control 
chemical rock changing degree. At scarce rain regions, like the arid and semi-arid areas of 
Santiago, the chemical alteration processes are naturally slower. Rock’s influence depends 
on its texture, structure and mineral composition. The structure and texture are decisive to 
water path and solely by the surface rock area – water interaction. Cationic groundwater 
content is then changed, as some of these rock elements, like Na, Ca, Mg and K dissolves 
easily, function of pH and temperature (Custodio and Llamas, 2001). 
 
Several hydrochemistry investigations have been done at Santiago Island. Barmen et al. 
(1984) made principal groundwater elements studies and Tritium determinations at north, 
central and eastern locations. Akiti (1985), has done stable isotope’s determinations (2H, 18O, 
13C), Tritium and 14C at Tarrafal and Achada Baleia locations. The INGRH (1994) has done a 
similar study, including the first rain water chemical and isotopic analyses at Santiago Island. 
Recent studies have been from Hydroarid project. Under the scope of this project, a new 
chemical campaign has been done, sampling uniformly the island at 133 points. (Gomes, 
2007; Pina, 2009), and 2H, 18O, and 3H isotopic analyse to 60 points (a subset of the 133) 
have been also accomplished (Carreira et al., 2007a). Last hydrochemical and stable 
isotopic study was about potential recharge areas and salinization groundwater mechanism 
at eastern seashore, Condesso de Melo et al. (2008). 
 
The following descriptions are mostly based on the Hydroarid project data. Chemical 
analyses are from samples taken in June-July 2003 (before the “rain” season), in November-
January, 2003-2004 (after the “rain” season) and throughout the year 2004. Isotopic 
analyses are from December 2005, February 2006 and November 2006, altogether with 
chemical samples analyses. The number of samples by watershed and hydrogeologic unit 
are given at the table 6.8, and plotted at figure 6.24.

All these water sampling and analysis’s procedures are described at the Gomes (2007) and 
Pina (2009) thesis. The analysis’s electroneutrality (EN) value is under 4% for 33% of total 
samples and between 4 to 10% for the remaining 77%. The acceptable error should be less 
than 5% (Appelo and Postma, 2005) or 4% to “high” electric conductivity waters (Custodio 
and Llamas, 2001). Groundwater samples total mean EN value is 6.45%.

6.7.1 – Groundwater temperature 
 
Water and rock temperature is important because it enhances significantly the mineral and 
gases’ solubility. However, temperature data analyses have shown that no significant 
difference exists between shallow and depth groundwater, and between the different 
hydrogeological units. Temperature remains almost the same throughout the year, with small 
amplitude, less than 1 to 2 ºC. Several boreholes follow the seasonal atmospheric 
temperature variation being always warmer than air. Figure 6.25a) plots the mean measured 
temperatures. Mean temperature is around 26 ºC, with some spurious watershed points. 
Minimum and maximum temperatures (20.3 and 34.9 ºC) were measured at Middle Unit 
formation. The Recent Unit as the smallest amplitude between extreme temperatures.

6.7.2 – Groundwater pH values 
 
The pH parameter is very important because it controls chemical reactions, like acid-base 
equilibrium, hydrolyze, adsorption, redox (Langmuir, 1997). At Santiago, a clear difference 
can be seen; the eastern region groundwater are slightly acid to neutral (6.75 to 7.25) and 
western regions more alkaline (&gt; 7.25). A possible explanation can be related to the 
predominant winds at this island side, with bigger moisture content and also were most 
groundwater extraction happens, water time residence and rock-water interaction being 
smaller. Figure 6.25b) shows the mean measured pH values. Minimum and maximum pH 
(5.7 and 8.2) were measured at Middle Unit formations. Like temperature values, the Recent 
Unit has the smallest amplitude between extreme pH values (6.5 to 7.5). Lowest and highest 
pH areas in figure 6.25b) are due to some pH “outlier” measured single points. The problem 
always happens when the spatial distribution is non-uniform and extreme data points are 
present, creating an “eye pattern” (closed lines around a single point).

6.7.3 – Groundwater electric conductivity 
 
Groundwater electric conductivity (EC) it’s a function of ionic content and also temperature. It 
is a measure of mineralization degree, e.g. by rock dissolution, or can result from industrial, 
agriculture, domestic and salt intrusion contaminations. At Santiago, high EC values are 
found near the sea, decreasing inland and in altitude. Eastern island side shows grater EC 
values than the western side. This later coastline is higher above the sea with fewer 
inhabitants and consequently, smaller water extraction needs. Areas with smaller EC at north 
and south correspond to springs and boreholes at Middle Unit. Although some variability in 
EC values has been observed, the majority of sampled points haven’t changed significantly 
over the time of this study, especially between dry and rain epochs. Exceptions have been 
detected at some points in Recent Unit formations, near the sea, with smaller EC values after 
“rain season”, certainly due to the increase in the inland freshwater content. The EC 
distribution is shown at figure 6.26.

For the Bottom Unit, the minimum and maximum values were 440 and 2750 µS.cm-1. Middle 
Unit shows much greater amplitude, from 362 to 53500 µS.cm-1 (seawater) and Recent Unit 
from 503 to 8550 µS.cm-1. These very high EC were observed in wells close to the sea. If we 
exclude these outlier points (with explained cause), the mean EC values (table 6.11)

between the Bottom and Middle Units are similar but smaller than those in Recent Unit 
measured values. The sampled watersheds at this last Unit are mostly wells in alluvium 
formations. At the Bottom Unit the EC mean value stays constant over the distance to 
shoreline. For the Middle and Recent Units, that not holds. EC values grow significantly 
starting from 1.5 km to shoreline. 
 
6.7.4 – Groundwater cations 
 
In Santiago Island, the relation between major cation’s abundances has as follows; 
[Na] &gt; [Mg] ? [Ca] &gt; [K]. Cations are the groundwater constituents who have major affinity 
and interaction with environment rocks and came from this rock-water interaction process 
and also from human activities and seawater intrusion. Mean observed values are given in 
table 6.12. 
 

Sodium (Na
+
) 

 
This is by far the predominant cation in the island groundwater, with 55% of the total cation’s 
amount. Sodium can have different sources; Halite (sodium chlorine) maritime aerosol 
deposition at dry season (incorporated to soil in “rain season”), alkaline type rock with plenty 
of Sodium, Calcium and Magnesium, and ultimately from seawater intrusion. Groundwater 
Sodium distribution seems almost constant throughout the island, with a 100 to 150 mg per 
liter mean content. It is the natural background concentration, presumable from rain and rock 
minerals dissolution origin. Exceptions to these are the north and eastern regions. At those 
locations, the values are much higher, presumable from seawater intrusion origin. At the 
Bottom Unit hydrogeological unit the Sodium mean value stays constant with distance to 
shoreline. For the Middle and Recent Units, the Sodium concentration grows significantly, 
starting 1.5 km to shoreline, figure 6.27a). That mimics the EC behavior because this 
parameter is a function of water salt concentration. Range values are from 19.7 to 438 mg.L-1 
at Bottom Unit, 22.6 to 652 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 67.6 to 1349 mg.L-1 at the Recent Unit. 
 
Magnesium (Mg

2+
) 

 
For most of Santiago areas, Magnesium content surpasses the 25 mg per liter. At the 
eastern coastal region, that value is much higher. Magnesium origin must come from 
dolomite and magnesite dissolution (Martins, 2003) or olivine hydrolyzes (Matos Alves et al., 
1979). Range values are from 4.1 to 51.7 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 1.8 to 64.6 mg.L-1 at Middle 
Unit and 6.0 to 347.9 mg.L-1 at Recent Unit. Magnesium distribution is plotted at figure 
6.27b). 
 
Calcium (Ca

2+
) 

 
The highest values of Calcium concentration do exist at the east and north island side. Origin 
can be from Calcite dissolution (Calcite exists at the major volcanic formations), carbonate 
rock dissolution at Tarrafal region (at north), by plagioclase hydrolyze and pyroxene’s mineral 
alterations or by seawater intrusion with Sodium cationic exchange. Range values are from 
8.0 to 126.4 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 6.4 to 1280 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 32.0 to an extreme 



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS 
__________________________ 

 133

value of 3496 mg.L-1 at Recent Unit (last value comes from one seawater intruded well). 
Molar ratio between Ca/Mg is less than one at most samples. That means that there is a

Potassium (K
+
) 

 
Groundwater Potassium distribution is enhanced in the northwest, west and east regions of 
the island. The Potassium origin must be related to potassium feldspats interactions. They 
have been identified in fractures at CA formations, with frequent well developed crystals 
(Matos Alves et al., 1979). Another Potassium origin is surely the fertilizer application at 
farmed valley’s soils, although the limited Potassium mobility caused by soil retention at clay 
layers. Range values are from 4.1 to 51.7 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 1.8 to 64.6 mg.L-1 at Middle 
Unit and 6.0 to an extreme value of 348 mg.L-1 at Recent Unit (last value is from a seawater 
intruded well). Potassium distribution is given at figure 6.28b).

6.7.5 – Groundwater anions 
 
The relation between major anion’s abundances in Santiago Island is as fallowing; 
[HCO3] &gt;[Cl] ? [SO4] &gt; [NO3]. These compounds, Bicarbonate, Sulphate and Nitrate reveal 
less affinity with environment rock than observed cations. These anions came from natural 
rock-water interaction process and also from human contamination, like agriculture activities. 
Mean values are given at table 6.13. 
 
Chloride (Cl

-
) 

 
This groundwater anion specimen comes directly or indirectly from seawater, as rock source 
chloride has a small expression. It reaches the groundwater by sodium chlorine maritime 
aerosol deposition (like sodium) and by seawater intrusion at the seashore. Inland, the 
groundwater mean chloride concentrations is less than 150 mg.L-1. The major groundwater 
Chloride distribution happens at eastern and northwest shoreline, figure 6.29a). The Bottom 
Unit has the smaller concentration and Recent Unit the highest. Range values are from 49.6 
to 535 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 26.2 to 5,708 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 42.5 to a extreme value 
of 14003 mg.L-1 at Recent Unit (last value is from a seawater intruded well). 
 
Bicarbonate (HCO3

-
) 

 
The highest concentrations of Bicarbonate are located inland at central island major recharge 
areas, figure 6.29b). For most samples, it is the major anion. In addition to rainwater origin, it 
comes also from carbonate dissolution or minor silicate weathering. The Bottom Unit has the 
highest concentration and the Recent Unit has the smallest. Range values are from 146 to 
708 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, 78 to 566 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 78 to 372 mg.L-1 at Recent 
Unit.

Sulphate (SO4

2-
) 

 
The anion Sulphate is one of the less abundant in Santiago’s water samples. Distribution is 
rather uniform except near the east coast and at “Órgãos” formation (Bottom Unit), figure 
6.30a). These inland higher concentrations are related to marine facies carbonate rocks. It’s 
roughly the same region were high bicarbonate values also take place. At shoreline, it may 
be related to seawater intrusion, as Sulphate is one of the major seawater anions. This 
explains the small concentration values observed at the Middle Unit. Range values are from 
4.6 to 296 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit, residual to 364 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and 18.2 to 546 mg.L-1 
in Recent Unit. 
 
Nitrate (NO3

-
) 

 
At Santiago, Nitrates doesn’t exist naturally. They leach into groundwater by overfertilization 
at farmed soils, especially in the stream valleys’ closest to the ocean. The other contaminant 
sources are manure, at some punctually intensive goat’s areas and nonagricultural sources 
such as septic systems and cesspools (Santiago Island hasn’t yet a developed residual 
drainage network). The majority of groundwater samples (98%) show Nitrates contends. 15% 
of all samples surpass the human consumption legal admitted maximum. Values range from 
&lt;0.1 to 23.0 mg.L-1 at Bottom Unit,&amp;lt;0.1 to 20.6 mg.L-1 at Middle Unit and&amp;lt;0.1 to 66.6 mg.L-1 
in Recent Unit. At this Unit highest values are observed at farmed areas; westwards of Praia 
(Cidade Velha), in the eastern side (S. Domingos, S. Cruz and S. Catarina) and at the east 
side, figure 6.30b).

The know Br/Cl ratio is an invaluable tracer of groundwater processes and origin (e.g., 
Simpson and Herczeg, 1994; Herczeg et al., 2001). Oceans have a constant molar Br/Cl 
ratio of 0.00154 (e.g., Drever, 1997; Davis et al., 1998, 2001). Small islands and coastal 
rainfall commonly have similar Br/Cl ratios. However, inland rainfall at arid or semi-arid 
climates may have lower ratios due to the tendency for Chloride to be removed by deposition 
of marine aerosols in coastal areas (Edmunds, 2001). 
 
At Santiago, the major part of the groundwater samples (for the three hydrogeologic units), 
have a Br/Cl ratio that fits to the ocean molar ratio (figure 6.31a), confirming groundwater 
origin. A few groundwater samples have a reduced ratio that could be due to interaction with 
Chloride bearing contaminants such as some fertilizers (Cartwright et al., 2006). However, 
the plot of molar Na/Cl ratio, figure 6.31b) (seawater as a constant ratio of 0.85) shows for 
higher concentration samples, that Sodium seems to be arrested by clay minerals. That’s 
predominant at Recent Unit formations and an indication of a seawater intrusion process, 
(Pina, 2009).

A strong correlation, with a fit regression of 99%, exist between the EC values and the major 
cations and anion’s summation, the calculated water total dissolved salts (TDS) or total 
salinity, figure 6.32. Although water samples have much more dissolved ions, their total 
weight amount is at least two orders of magnitude lesser than those major ones. 

Figure 6.32 – Groundwater electric conductivity versus total dissolved salts. 
 
The good correlation (R2 = 0.99) gives confidence about chemical data. The general relation 
EC versus TDS (expressed at equation (5.10)) is:

6.7.6 – Mineral saturation indices 
 
Previous studies about saturation indices (SI) of calcite, dolomite, magnesite and silica have 
been published (Akiti, 1985; Pina 2009). SI is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the ion 
activity product to the solubility product. 
 
At northwest area (Tarrafal region), the springs show an undersaturation condition of calcite 
and dolomite, meaning that water hasn’t been enough time to get into equilibrium with those 
minerals. That could represent a mixture of different origin waters. Concerning borehole 
waters, some are supersaturated with respect to dolomite and some are undersaturated with 
respect to calcite. This saturation index variation can be due to different waters contributions. 
 
At Eastern side (Achada Baleia region) most of the wells are undersaturated with respect to 
calcite, and a few are supersaturated with respect to dolomite. Calcite minerals appear to 
dominate as the majority of wells have Ca/Mg molal ratio greater than unity. In boreholes, 
most of the waters are supersaturated with respect to dolomite and only half of them are 
supersaturated with respect to calcite. The Ca/Mg molal ratio is generally lower than unity, 
showing a greater presence of magnesium over calcite minerals. The basic rocks of Middle 
formation are responsible for the dissolution of magnesium (Akiti, 1985). Deeper waters are 
older than superficial waters, because they had sufficient time to become in equilibrium with 
dolomite and calcite. These are the ones which SI values cannot be attributed to different 
waters mixing. Both borehole and well waters are silica saturated (typical at this crystalline 
rock environmental). 
 
As a rule, boreholes waters have a saturated and supersaturated condition related to 
dolomite and magnesite. This is also verified for calcite, but to a lesser extent. The majority 
of the water from springs and wells are undersaturated to those minerals (Pina, 2009). This 
means that superficial groundwater is younger than the deeper groundwater. 
 
 
6.7.7 – Chemical groundwater facies 
 
Groundwater chemical is usually described by plotting data in special diagrams, for instance, 
the Stiff and Piper patterns. The observed groundwater facies type it’s a consequence of 
water origin - rainfall, followed by its land deposition and variable interaction with 
underground rock minerals, and lately by human activity’s impact and / or seawater 
interconnection. All this factors, trough time, had influence over the observed water 
composition and quality, at the natural and manmade seepages. 
 
Island Stiff patterns (figure 6.33) show a distinct behaviour by hydrogeological unit and 
consequently, by watershed location. The central, south and southwest regions with Bottom 
and Middle units have an ionic amount (salts) much smaller than seashore ones at Recent 
Unit formations (eastern and north sides). 
  



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS

Figure 6.33 – Santiago’s groundwater Stiff pattern distribution, by hydrogeologic unit. 
 
The water samples from the central region of Santiago belong to the Na-HCO3 type, 
revealing the refereed influence of the geological matrix volcanic rocks. That’s where Bottom 
and Middle hydrogeologic Units dominate the landscape and most rainfall occurs. With low 
EC samples, marine aerosol influence was detected at recent underground shallow waters. 
Bicarbonate existences are related to the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) reaction at unsaturated zone 
infiltration and by dissolution of carbonate minerals and weathering silicate, later. That’s 
compatible with slightly acid and low EC new waters, (Pina, 2009). 
 
Over time, by gravity, water goes deeper and reacts with hosting siliceous rocks, becoming 
bicarbonate enriched and increasing pH value. The remaining ions also increase but water 
facies stays similar. EC ranges from 440 to 2750 µS.cm-1 which is a low to medium value. 
Sodium is the dominant cation, Bicarbonate and Chloride the dominant anions, by that order.

The Island’s most productive hydrogeological unit, the Middle Unit, have poor mineralized 
groundwater with HCO3-Cl-Na facies type. At pyroclastics deposit areas (MV formation) 
Sodium enrichment is observed. Near the sea, water’s facies from PA formation with intense 
pumping boreholes is Cl dominated (&gt; 2000 mg.L-1) plus Na (&gt; 1300 mg.L-1). 

Figure 6.34 – a) Santiago’s groundwater total dissolved salts distribution map, 

and  b) TDS versus seashore distance. 
 
The Recent Unit has made by permeable and non consolidated materials, mostly in the 
stream valleys, where intense agriculture practices exist (e.g. sugar cane, banana and 
papaya fields). They are at low altitudes near the ocean, and some boreholes extraction 
screens are under sea level. The dominant hydrochemical facies is Cl-Na, with high to very 
high EC values (2500 to 3000 µS.cm-1) and TDS (figure 6.34a and b). At this unit, some 
samples have a Cl-Mg facies. 
 
Although, the Recent Unit has a limited storage capacity and most groundwater leak to 
deeper levels (Middle Unit formations) or flows to the ocean, the valleys act as a recharge 
sue when strong rainfall happens. Throughout the valleys, there is some rainfall manmade 
catchment structures, with 2 to 4 meter high walls to retain incoming superficial waters. Most 
of these small dams are nowadays already filled with sediment and rocky debris. Boreholes 
at these formations usually have a high-water production and non controlled over-extraction 
is becoming a problem, especially at dry years.

Bottom and Middle Units, (modified from Carreira et al. (2007a)). 
 
Chemical species data were plotted versus total salinity of the water samples. No especial 
correlation was found between the chemical evolution and the specific hydrogeologic unit. 
Figure 6.37 represents the diagrams of the major cations and anions. In the Na, Cl, and SO4 
data versus TDS graphs, only one evolution trend line is recognized, pointing out to mixture 
with seawater or marine aerosol influence. However, in the Mg, Ca, HCO3 diagrams two 
evolution lines are identified after groundwater reach the 500 mg.L-1 TDS value, reflecting 
one the water-rock interaction processes and the other, with a lower slope value, the 
influence of the seawater composition (mixing and/or aerosol), (Carreira et al., 2007a). 
 
The high salt content within the groundwater systems appears to be restricted to agricultural 
areas in the valleys near the sea. The observed deterioration of the water quality limits its 
use for Human supply and for irrigated agriculture. This brackish water leads to potential soil 
salinization and alkalinisation, with the inherent soil deterioration and loss of productivity. 
Santiago’s water supply is almost entirely from groundwater source origin (exceptions are 
several desalinization units used for towns supply and Poilão catchment, used in the 
agriculture). Only one-third of those watersheds have freshwater (TDS &amp;lt;500 mg.L-1), figure 
6.34b), the remaining sources surpass greatly that amount, remarkably the wells closest to 
the sea.

6.7.8 – Environmental isotopes groundwater signature 
 
Isotopic hydrogeology uses environmental or artificial sources to outline water and 
groundwater. One of the most used environmental isotopic analyses is the 2H and 18O pair. 
They usually allow groundwater paths and fractioning to be followed. The fraction is mostly 
by evaporation and condensation process, (Custodio and Llamas, 2001). The 3H isotope 
measure is a technique to check recent age groundwater recharge. The piston-flow method 
can be used, assuming that the tritium peak migrates through the aquifer and retains its 
shape when isotope time series measures are not available (Siegel and Jenkins, 1987).

18O. The ?2H and ?18O were determined by the Instituto de Tecnologia Nuclear (ITN) 
equipment using the methods proposed by Friedman (1953) to 2H measures and by Epstein 
and Mayeda (1953) to 18O measures (Carreira et al., 2007a). The observed groundwater 
mean isotopic composition at Santiago Island is given at table 6.14. The isotopic contents 
obtained are close to the average isotopic composition over the Island as discussed by Akiti 
(1985), suggesting that the infiltrated meteoric waters were not subjected too much

evaporation, at most locations. Akiti as defined the isotopic composition of precipitation in 
Santiago (Akiti, 1985). In São Nicolau and Fogo islands similar studies and results have 
been also published, by Olivry (1981) and Heilweil (2009), respectively. Studies show that 
Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) is given by %&amp;amp;H ? 8.32 " %)*O ? 10.54 with mean 
weighted value of -36‰ for ?2H and -5.5 for ?18O. The Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL)

The isotopic groundwater composition data shows no strong correlation to watershed’s 
altitude (with 600 m variations). But data can be shifted by a small amount. The altitude ?18O 
meteoric gradient at tropical regions is known to be of ?1 to ?3‰ by km (e.g. Gonfiantini et 
al., 2001). This increase in isotopic depletion is generally attributed to the Rayleigh adiabatic 
condensation process. Diagram of ?18O versus ?2H (figure 6.38) exhibit two groups of 
groundwater samples: one group is composed by samples collected in the eastern side of 
Santiago Island (figure’s lower group), in most cases located near the shoreline. The other 
group is ascribed to higher altitude and inland sampled locations. 

Figure 6.38 – ?18O versus ?2H plot. Two group samples trend lines are fitted, with GMWL and LMWL 

as guidelines. Black filed dots - boreholes, (modified from Carreira et al. (2007a)). 
 
Both group samples have values under the GMWL and LMWL. The inland groundwater 
isotopic group‘s data can be explained by recharge’s intensive meteoric events. Those 
events have increased isotopic depletion. At the lower locations, the isotopic values suggest 
a recharge mixture of rainfall and runoff water partially evaporated. It is not to exclude a 
strong evapotranspiration through the unsaturated zone at agricultural land areas and the 
consequent soil salt increase. This type of isotopic pattern was also mentioned by Akiti

(1985). According to this author, the inland waters have similar isotopic history but different 
geochemical history, which depend on the weathering and permeability of the hosting rocks. 
 
The analyze of isotopic 18O data against the EC, TDS, Cl, SO4, Na and temperature content 
of the groundwater samples is plotted at figure 6.39. In these diagrams, two evolution lines 
can be observed, one showing the influence/mixture with seawater with a progressive 
enrichment in 18O and in the mineralization where the influence of marine aerosol cannot be 
excluded. No significant variation is detected with groundwater temperature.

Tritium measures and 

14
C values 

 
Tritium was also analyzed altogether with 2H and 18O isotope’s analysis. Measures were 
carried out at ITN laboratory. The error associated with the 3H measurements varies with the 
3H sample’s concentration, although usually is around 0.6 to 0.7 TU (Tritium Unit). Hydroarid 
project measured values range between 0 ± 0.7 TU and 3 ± 0.7 TU (2005-2006 measures), 
(Carreira et al., 2007b). 
 
Unfortunately, no long series of 3H content in rainfall are available on the archipelago of 
Cape Verde. In fact, face to the absence of 3H and the lower content found it is difficult to 
point the turnover rates of the groundwater. To overcome this gap, 3H are usually compared

on the basis of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) network stations records at 
similar latitudes islands; Barbados, Ascension Island, St. Helena. Barmen et al. (1990) 
estimation of the natural background concentration of 3H in Cape Verde’s precipitation was 
less than or equal to about 3 TU prior to 1953 and after 1990. Relatively large quantities of 
man produced 3H were introduced into the atmosphere by many thermonuclear testing in the 
1950s and 1960s. The estimated peak precipitation 3H concentrations in Cape Verde are 
about 175 TU in 1964 (Kallrén and Schreiber 1988). Observations show atmospheric 3H 
concentrations at Santiago decreasing rapidly to less than about 5 TU during the 1980s, as 
indicated by five precipitation samples collected during 1984, with values from 2.3 ± 0.1 to 
4.4 ± 0.2 TU (Akiti 1985). One sample collected on nearby island of Fogo in 1987 had a 3H 
concentration of 3.0 ± 1 TU (Barmen et al. 1990). Recent values (2005) are from rain-fed 
only agricultural products analyses at Fogo Island, with 3.0 and 1.0 TU (Heilweil et al., 2009)  
 
The measured maximum value of 3 ± 0.7 TU can reflect water’s age with a few years or a 
mixture with 3H enriched older water. Low Tritium values waters indicating even younger 
waters. Tritium measures versus electric conductivity shows this trend, with younger 
groundwater having high EC values (more salt content), figure 6.40. With this 3H data, no 
correlation was found against sampling altitudes and lithologic or hydrogeologic units. 

Figure 6.40 – Groundwater Tritium versus electric conductivity. 

The associated error bar is plotted, (modified from Carreira et al. (2007b)). 
 
The previous work of Akiti at Santiago, from 1984 to 1985, included measures of 3H and 14C. 
In the north part of the island (Tarrafal region) Akiti obtain 0.2 ± 0.2 and 1.0 ± 0.2 TU at 
springs and deep boreholes (150 to 200 m), showing that recharge water was prior to year 
1952. It means at least a residence time of 30 years and consequently, a limited groundwater 
renewing capability. This result was confirmed by 14C borehole measures at the same region, 
with groundwater ages greater than 30 years. In the eastern side (Achada Baleia), Akiti has 
measured 0.0 ± 0.2 to 7.1 ± 1.0 TU, respectively in boreholes and wells, (equivalent to a 
decay-correction concentration of 2 TU by 2005). That means that wells received recent 
recharge while the boreholes were receiving water slowly coming from joints and fractures. 
The corresponding 14C analyses show that the major boreholes have relatively contemporary 
waters.

Conclusions from the isotopic and hydrochemical waters composition is that groundwater at 
Santiago are naturally recharged by precipitation, which has not been subjected to 
evaporation (or was just minimal). The infiltration process is fast and existing fractures play a 
very important role in that process. Shallow waters from wells are partly recharged by water 
coming from runoff episodic floods in the stream valleys. The higher salt content and EC 
values observed at wells located very near the ocean are due to seawater intrusion. The high 
salt content and EC values at deep borehole waters could mean also a salt water intrusion or 
solid salt dissolution, as the groundwater movement at these lowest valley’s regions, near 
the sea, must have an upward component. 
 
 
6.7.9 – SAR index 
 
A significant amount of the groundwater extraction is applied into land irrigation. With only an 
annual short period of precipitation, irrigation is needed to support useful agriculture 
practices, especially to overcome the evaporation and transpirations’ losses. The 
percentages of water in public distributions are: 44.2% to human consumption, 53.5% to 
irrigation (27.6 and 25.9%, respectively to traditional and drip irrigation) and only 2.3% to 
industrial activities (INGRH). These are values of 2005, but percentages are roughly the 
same throughout the decade, with an increasing trade between drip irrigation to traditional 
one. Total official water amount was 4.479×106 m3. To this we have to add individual owners’ 
water extraction, mainly to irrigation purposes also. 
 
The major concern with this groundwater used for irrigation are the decrease crop yields and 
land degradation as a result of excess salts present in water and in the soils. One of the 
parameters that can be useful to the agriculture land use management is the water sodium 
content, given by the Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) index, altogether with groundwater EC 
and soil type. The SAR index value is a measure of the relative concentration of sodium to 
calcium and magnesium. SAR is defined by the following expression, with cation’s quantities 
given in meq per liter (Richards, 1954): 
 

     SAR ? 012
34562278626

    (6.4) 

 
This measure of “water irrigation sodium hazard” is important as the high sodium ion’s 
presence in water affects the permeability of soil and causes infiltration problems. This 
happens because sodium when present in the soil in the exchangeable form replaces the 
calcium and magnesium adsorbed on the soil clays and causes dispersion of soil particles. 
That is, if calcium and magnesium are the predominant cations adsorbed on the soil 
exchange complex, the soil tends to be easily cultivated and has a permeable and granular 
structure. With this dispersion, the result is a breakdown of soil aggregates. The soil 
becomes hard and compact when dry. This will reduce water infiltration to the soil surface 
and down the profile, and limit aeration, leading to reduced crop growth. (Adapted from 
ANZECC).  



SANTIAGO ISLAND SETTINGS

When a high sodium concentration takes place it become a problem as the infiltration rate is 
reduced to such a rate that the vegetation and crop do not have enough water available. 
Furthermore, the hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile could become too low to provide 
adequate drainage. The plant extracts water from the soil by exerting an absorptive force 
greater than that which holds the water to the soil particles. If the plant cannot make 
sufficient internal adjustment and exert enough force, it is not able to extract sufficient water 
and will suffer water stress. This happens when the soil becomes at a dry condition. Salt in 
the soil-water increases the force the plant must exert to extract water (the osmotic effect or 
osmotic potential). Other problems caused by an excess of sodium is the formation of 
crusting seed beds, temporary saturation of the surface soil, high pH and the increased 
potential for diseases, weeds, soil erosion, lack of oxygen and inadequate nutrient 
availability, (Adapted from ANZECC). 
 
An infiltration problem occurs if the irrigation water does not enter the soil rapidly enough 
during a normal irrigation cycle to replenish the soil with water needed by the crop before the 
next irrigation and to avoid water stress. The reduced infiltration rate, if due to quality of 
applied water, is usually a problem within the upper few centimeters. The water infiltration 
problem reduces the quantity of water put into the soil for later use by the crop. The soil and 
water salinity reduces the availability of the water in storage (Rhoades, 1977; Oster and 
Schroer, 1979). 
 
But sodium himself is not a discriminator. The SAR index needs to be associated to 
groundwater EC and thus related with soil type. At the figures 6.41 and 6.42 are stated, 
those relationships between SAR and EC measured values at Santiago Island springs, wells 
and boreholes groundwater, to the infiltration rate problem and soil structure stability. 

Figure 6.41 – Relative rate of water infiltration as affected by Santiago’s groundwater calculated SAR 

and measured EC. (After Rhoades (1977); Oster and Schroer (1979)).

Actually, a newer index, the adjusted SAR (adj SAR) is defined (Suarez, 1981). It 
encompasses and offers a better insight into the change in calcium in the soil-water due to 
addition by dissolution of calcium from soil carbonates and silicates, or loss of calcium from 
soil-water by precipitation as carbonates. The SAR value underpredicts by 10 to 20% the adj 
SAR value, but SAR index still are acceptable to irrigation problems analyses. 
 
Figure 6.41 shows that about half (55%) the groundwater characteristics have an “infiltration 
rate reduction problem”, increasing the water loss by evaporation at irrigation. The same data 
is plotted against soil stability and the potential impact of irrigation water quality on soil 
structure can be thus detected. Furthermore, about half the groundwater is suitable to land 
irrigation, not changing the soil structure stability. Comparison is done against standard 
curves from DNR (1997). 

Figure 6.42 – Santiago’s groundwater EC versus SAR to soil stability, with two 

samples group identification, (adapted from DNR (1997)). 

 
SAR values range from 0.5 to 18.5 and EC from 362 to 16600 µS.cm-1. Although some 
scattering points, two distinct clusters are recognized at figure 6.41 and 6.42 (group, I and II). 
A closer analysis for each one reveals that group I data come from higher locations (75% are 
above 100 m altitude) and group II data come mostly from lower regions (65% are below 100 
m high). Threshold altitude difference is that below 100 m, soils belong to the alluvium 
Quaternary formation. Group II is in a stable soil condition but group I is conditioned by soil 
type and problems can arise with irrigation. 
 
With this observed SAR and EC groundwater values, the soil and crop types are essential to 
yield values. The salt content of the soil groundwater in the crop’s root zone (the average 
root zone salinity, ECR) is important in assessing which crops are suitable for growing in 
specific soils and depend on those soils. The ECR is given at expression (6.5), function of

irrigation water EC and soil type by the average root zone leaching fraction (LF). The last 
value represents the proportion of applied water moving below the root zone, i. e. it 
represents the applied surface irrigation water fraction that percolates below the root zone. 
The remaining value (1 - LF) replaces water used by the crop to meet its evapotranspiration 
demand and water lost by surface evaporation. The LF value is higher at sand and sandy 
soils (0,6) and lower to loam, light clay and heavy clay soils (0.33 to 0.2).

after Rhoades (1974) and Rhoades and Merrill (1976). 
 
Table 6.15 reports the ECR common accepted limits and rating for plant salt tolerance. 
Taking a mean value of 0.5 for the LF parameter (mixture of sandy and clayed soil), it gives 
that about half data points locations (52%) can support sensitive to moderately sensitive 
crops. Unfortunately, those places are located at higher altitudes. There the infiltration 
problem is more intense (figure 6.43) and were a significant crop amount is irrigation rain 
dependent.

plant salt tolerance groupings, (after Maas, (1984)).

Crop salt tolerance needs to be taken into account when assessing the suitability of water 
and soil for irrigation. Table 6.16 includes some plants usually found at Santiago’s farm 
lands. Crossing this data with irrigation groundwater results that most vegetables have some 
yield reduction as the majority of these plantations are located at the lower valleys’ areas, 
near the shoreline (figure 6.35), were ECR is higher.

Figure 6.43 represents the calculated root zone electric conductivity ECR distribution and also 
the locations of infiltration rate problems. Spatial distribution of the areas with irrigation 
problems related to groundwater hydrochemical composition has two distinct origins. Inland 
higher locations and also at west and southwest, soil infiltration problems occur. At the 
eastern side of Santiago, the ECR values are mostly above the allowed maximum and 
diminish the mean production of vegetables.

TEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS 

 

This seventh chapter describes the TEM acquired soundings and their modelling. The 

relation of hydrogeologic parameters to the obtained geoelectric models is advanced, as also 

the relation with groundwater quality. 

 

 

7.1 – TEM soundings at Santiago 
 

Transient electromagnetic soundings were acquired at the most important creek valleys and 

agricultural areas of Santiago Island, figure 7.1. The majority of these sampled valleys are 

located at island east side; S. Domingos (near Achada Baleia village), Seca and Picos (near 

Pedra Badejo village), Salto, Flamengos and S Miguel (near Calheta de S. Miguel village). At 

the northwest island side near Tarrafal village, two more sites were covert; at Chão Bom 

plateau (a one kilometre square agricultural area near the sea) and Ribeira Grande creek 

valley. All these creeks only possess superficial waters at the “rain season” from respective 

hydrographic basin catchment runoff. Near the ocean, valleys are filled with alluvium 

Quaternary sediments and these soils are the best ones for agriculture. Most of these 

chosen valleys are intensely farmed throughout the year (S. Miguel and Ribeira Grande to a 

lesser extent) as the irrigation water is mostly from local wells and borehole groundwater 

extraction. At the remaining island rural areas, where no groundwater pumping or net 

distribution water exists, the agriculture practices are rain-fed based only. 

 

The TEM soundings have been acquired at several campaigns, between the year 2005 and 

2009 (see table 7.1). The principal areas were surveyed at June 2005, November 2005 and 

September 2006. At every next campaign, repetitions at some of the previous places have 

been also done. From year 2007 onward only this sounding’s repetitions took place. A few 

more soundings were done; at Campelo (to the south of Salto valley) over some previous 

VLF-EM profiles (Summer 2005) and at Assomada central plateau for static shift 

magnetoteluric correction (September 2006), (Santos et al., 2006). When possible, 

repetitions were exactly at the same sounding spot. Not being so, as closest as possible. The 

major and principal surveys took 4 to 5 days field work. Repetitions last only just 2 to 3 days.

7.1.1 – S. Domingos data 
 

São Domingos stream valley is the southernmost of the surveyed locations. It’s nearby 

Achada Baleia village. At surveyed area, the valley is 300 to 400 m wide with 30 to 40 m 

hillside and 15 to 20 degree slope walls. Soundings were taken from near the ocean, at 2 m 

amsl to 2100 m inland and 34 m high. Creek bed altitude grows steadily from the sea. A few 

soundings were done outside the valley. Hydrographic catchment basin covers 31.3 km
2
. 

 

Information from valley’s borehole logs indicates a mean 12 m alluvium thickness over the 

PA basaltic formations, at the valley centre. The basaltic formations are fractured and have 

sometimes pyroclastics intrusions and clays. Deepest drilled borehole goes to 46 m below 

the mean sea level. No direct geologic information is known beyond this limit. Agriculture 

practices exist in the valley, except the last 500 m near the sea. Production of green 

vegetables is declining especially at this nearest to shoreline valley area. 

Figure 7.2 – TEM soundings number and location at S. Domingos, over simple geologic map 

description; PA – Pico da Antónia formation, a – Quaternary alluvium formations. 

 

Acquisition of TEM soundings (and respective numbering) starts from the shoreline 

throughout the axis valley. The majority of the TEM-FAST 48 soundings were acquired with a 

25 m × 25 m single loop wire, with a mean current of 3.0 ampere and time channel from 4 to 

9 (maximum). The soundings’ location is shown at figure 7.2 together with the simple 

geology sketch of the region. The loop dimension was primarily chosen to have a better 

superficial accuracy and smaller 3D effect over soundings (Goldman et al., 1994; 

Rabinovich, 1995), and to survey the know aquifer. Figure 7.3 plots the TEM soundings’ 

locations plus the boreholes and wells (with lithologic and chemical information) over a 

photographic image (Google image).

Figure 7.3 – TEM soundings, boreholes and wells location at S. Domingos valley, 

(adapted from Google images), 

 

The figures 7.4 a) to c) display the characteristic S. Domingos valley landscape scenario and 

environment. 

 

An initial inspection of the TEM apparent resistivity curves show that the medium is 

conductor to highly conductor, i.e. the measured apparent resistivity has low to very low 

values. Krigged overall distribution of apparent resistivity for eight increasing time windows 

after the turnoff (and increasingly depth) is plotted in figures 7.5 to 7.8. The measured 

apparent resistivity increases inland upstream. This observed effect could arise from different 

sources; effectively freshwater to seawater mixture, altogether with a bending alluvium 

substratum (thinner alluvium near the sea) or some added effect over the normal transient 

induction process. Notably, all these issues can be presents at this geologic scenario, plus 

some lateral effects, i.e. some 2D or 3D effects. 

 

First results came from 1D data modelling and model analyses. The resistivity of the deepest 

layer is similar to seawater typical values of 0.3-0.4 to 1.0 ohm.m, in many models. This 

would imply a water brine condition or localized 3D effect at some soundings. A closer 

inspection of the decay induction signal reveals also that signal is affected by SPM, most 

probably from magnetite, maghemite or hematite content of shallow sedimentary formation 

near the sea. Previously studies found those minerals (Martins, 2003). A superficial sand 

sample (from Seca region beach) was also analyzed, confirming this magnesian based 

mineral’s presence (João Coroado, personal communication), figure 7.9a) and 7.9b).

, within the literature range values (Schön, 1998) and the 

influence of the shallow layer 10 m thick, corresponding to the sedimentary formation, was 

tested. Distinct responses are obtained from these two values variations; one gets almost no 

model influence (a few percent of the resistivity) when layer thickness is modified between 1 

to 20 m, but changing susceptibility up and down one-magnitude order (to 0.0001 or 0.01) 

shows greater models variability outside the geologic accepted limits (very high and 

extremely low resistivity values). Figure 7.10a) show the observed SPM affect at two of the 

soundings, as refereed in subchapter (2.7.3). The respective models and responses are 

shown in figure 7.10b), taking into account this SPM effect.

7.1.1.1 – 1D inversion of TEM data from S. Domingos 
 

Taking into account this SPM effect, the valley’s TEM soundings were accordingly modelled. 

Figure 7.11 plots the typical observed TEM curves and model fit response, from near the 

ocean upstream the valley. Measured noise is between 2 to 3 nVm
-2
 with any nearby major 

EM noise sources. Error band from stacking procedure is a few percent at last time points.

Model’s errors have a mean 2 to 3% misfit to data points. Figure 7.12 shows the respective 

1D mean model of TEM soundings showing in figure 7.11. With these low resistive values, 

equivalent models are only a few percent different from the mean values. A characteristic of 

some models is a conductive layer in 15 to 20 m depth. This is in accordance with lithologic

logging information at middle valley boreholes, as can be seen at figure 7.13 sketch. Below 

this depth, resistivity corresponding to the aquifer system is around 10 to 20 ohm.m.

At roughly 70-80 m depth (at soundings depth limit) a highly conductive substratum is 

detected in the majority of the soundings throughout the valley. This is the cause of the 

observed continuous decreasing of apparent resistivity curves. The most reasonable 

explanation is that this phenomenon might be related to clay saturated layer with fossil saline 

water (Goldman et al., 1991). Clays have a very low hydraulic conductivity, and all these 

layer levels were under seawater in the past. This could be the cause for the high degree of 

salinization after long time over-extraction of boreholes far from the sea. 

 

Near the shoreline, the typical freshwater-seawater interface is detected, as can be seen in 

the 1D sounding models shown in figure 7.14 (TEM sounding AB 9 is 550 m from the sea). 

The interface calculated by the Ghyben-Herzberg or Todd relations for stagnant seawater 

(Bear et al., 1999) are in accordance with the measured fresh water (brackish water) levels 

at this area. The water table level measured in wells is around 1 to 2 m high above the sea 

level. The assumed interface is shown in the resistivity cross section (figure 7.15). 

 

Figure 7.14 – TEM sounding mean models from near the ocean (AB 1) to inland (AB 9). 

 

The quasi-2D cross sections were assembled from the 1D sounding models (figures 7.15 

and 7.16). These cross sections are taken from AEMR TEM inversion software, and aren’t 

really a 2D data inversion nor a 1D inversion with laterally constrains (LCI) as written at 

chapter 3. Models are stitched-together into a section, and lateral continuity is guarantied by 

simple interpolation between each model. With this procedure, it’s possible to delineate the 

layered structures in the valley, although some local 3D effects can be present. Shallow 

buried small rock debris from ancient runoff events and wall’s erosion effects are greatly 

smoothed in the TEM process. 

 

The resistivity cross section along the axis of the valley and starting from the sea is shown in 

figure 7.15. The fresh sea water interface is seen at cross section right side. An upper 

conductive layer at roughly 15 to 20 m depth bellow surface and thicker near the sea is seen. 

The resistivity increases going inland and seems to have lateral continuity coming from the 

sea. It must be separated from bottom freshwater by an impermeable clay layer. At the 

bottom, 60 m bellow the mean sea level a conductive layer is present and extent all over the 

valley. That is shown in three perpendicular middle valley cross sections (figure 7.16 a) and 

b)). The BB’ cross section exhibit a step like structure in the north side, that is, the conductive 

layer is closer to the surface. This is an uncommon behaviour and a local 3D effect is not to 

exclude as an explanation of this feature.

To check and confirm these resistivity values and lateral continuity of layers, a quasi-3D 

modelling was done with the data soundings.

7.1.1.2 – S. Domingos quasi-3D data inversion 
 

The quasi-3D modelling was calculated with a spatially-constrained-inversion algorithm (SCI) 

that uses the 1D approach in forward calculations (Santos, personal communication; Santos, 

2011a and 2011b). As usual, model parameters are the logarithmic resistivity of the layers 

beneath each sounding site. The number of layers can be chosen. On the several modelling 

tests made in this thesis they have varied between 13 and 19 layers. The incremental depth 

is exponential, starting with a shallow 2 m layer and a step of 2??,?????	?
 to the n
th
 thickness 

layer. Total number of resistivity model parameters to fit is a function of the number of layers’ 

and soundings. 

 

A total of 38 TEM soundings was used at S. Domingos. The number of time channels used in 

the inversion and fit of each sounding was unequal. They were decimated and vary from just 

10 to 21 data points per soundings. The starting initial models were always a resistivity 

uniform half space. 

 

The effective distance constrain (EDC) parameter between soundings can be also modified. 

It can be set to zero and thus the inversion is regardless of surrounding ones. Or it can be 

extended (by 6 steeps) to encompass nearby models. With the spatial spreading of 

soundings in S. Domingos valley, the maximum constrained distance was around 320 m. 

Near the sea and far from it, at beginning and ending of axial profile, the number of TEM 

soundings is smaller, and they are far apart each other. The overall mean distance between 

soundings is 125 m. At mid valley they are clustered and inversion results are expected to be 

better in this part. Many inversion tests were carried out changing the initial damping factor 

parameter (?), as also the number of layers and the maximum depth of investigation, the 

neighbours sounding distance and stopping convergence criteria (final iteration and rms 

numbers). 

Figure 7.17 – Mean rms quasi-3D models misfit and iteration number (blue square), and cumulative 

sounding pair number (red square) for several constrained distances at S. Domingos valley. 

Initial damping factor set to 0.1 and 15 layers with 10 ohm.m model space. 

 

A maximum of 60 iterations and a 0.01 rms value for stopping the calculations were 

adequate with a starting homogeneous resistivity model of 10 (or 20) ohm.m. The output 

results with 15 layers (till 80 m deep) are better than just only 13 layers (till 60 m deep). This

concern to edge conditions and measured data values. The global model’s misfit is worse 

when the EDC distance parameter is turned off (around 4% error) and stays slightly under 

3% when neighbours influence is considered. The smaller distance influence value was 54 

m. Figure 7.17 give the mean final rms misfit value and iteration number to such allowed 

influence distances, with the same starting conditions, as also the increasingly sounding’s 

pairs number under EDC. This behaviour might indicate a rather smooth horizontal changing 

medium, and that misfit are limited by data errors. Each inversion’s run takes around 15 to 20 

minutes maximum computing time (dual-core 2.6 GHz CPU and 2 GB memory machine).

Some 1D models and corresponding sounding’s data fit are shown in figure 7.18 and 7.19. 

Although the greater vertical detail of the quasi-3D models, the results are similar to 1D 

single inversion, with global mean differences under 10% between both sets of models. 

 

The figure 7.20 shows the inversion result for the AA’ resistivity cross section. The quasi-2D 

model structure is quite similar to the previous stitched 1D results. This can also be seen in 

the perpendicular cross sections (figure 7.21), with the high conductive bottom layer and 

aquifer bulk resistivity values from 10 to 20 ohm.m. The low resistivity bottom layer is placed 

somewhat closer to surface beneath sounding 20 in the section BB’.

7.1.2 – Seca and Picos data 
 

The Seca and Picos creek valleys are located 10 km to the north of S. Domingos valley, near 

Santa Cruz village (figure 7.1). These two contiguous valleys show a similar morphology to 

the previous one with the difference of being much wider. At the coastline the joint valley end 

span for some 1300 m wide. A few kilometres inland, they attain together some 3500 m wide. 

These two hydrographic catchment basins are the biggest ones at Santiago, with 49.9 and 

71.5 km
2
, for Pico and Seca, respectively. Floods are frequent at rainy season, as both 

basins include the central mountains where intense precipitation happens as recharge areas. 

TEM soundings have been carried out from the shoreline (at roughly 3 to 4 m amsl) to 3300 

and 2000 m inland at 29 and 25 m high, for Seca and Picos valleys, respectively. Again, the 

creek bed altitude grows steadily from the sea. A few soundings have also been done, to the 

southeast, outside the Seca valley. 

 

Information from borehole logs in the valleys indicates a mean 25 m thick shallow basaltic 

alluvium with pebbles, resting over the fractured PA basaltic formation. Sandy and clayed 

layer’s intercalations exist between these two formations. Deepest drilled boreholes reach 

about 55 m below the mean sea level. No direct geologic information is known beyond this 

limit. Intense agriculture activities take place at both valleys, except in the last couple of 

hundred meters from the sea. At Picos valley a considerable large area is devoted to banana 

production. The situation is analogous to that in the S. Domingos valley with vegetable’s 

productivity declining near the shoreline.

7.1.2.1 – 1D inversion of TEM data from Seca 
 

Figure 7.26 shows typical observed TEM curves and their model response fit, from near sea 

going upstream Seca’s valley. Measured noise is again from 2 to 3 nVm
-2
 and error band 

from stacking procedure is at most a few percent of signal (for last time points) with no major 

EM noise sources at the surveyed places. 
 

Figure 7.26 – Some Seca measured TEM curves and 1D mean model fit response. 

 

Misfits of the models responses have a mean of 4 to 5%. Figure 7.27 shows the respective 

1D mean model for the TEM soundings shown in figure 7.26. The majority of the curves 

decrease smoothly to low apparent resistivity values. At some locations, there is a 

conductive layer, roughly at 15 to 20-30 m depth. This is in accordance with some lithologic 

logging information from boreholes, as can be seen in figure 7.28. At and below this depth,

electric resistivity corresponding to the aquifer formations is around 10 to 20 ohm.m. Under 

this, a higher conductivity layer is again present, at roughly 50 m deep below mean sea level.

Resistivity cross sections were assembled from the valley 1D sounding models (figure 7.29). 

As previously, this cross section was taken from AEMR TEMRES inversion software. 

Borehole and wells measures show that the water level is about 9 to 10 m amsl at 3 km from 

the coastline (FT63 and FBE169) and almost at the sea level at the shoreline, giving a 

hydraulic gradient of 0.002 to 0.003.

The same upper conductive layer roughly 20 m thicker near the sea and increasing resistivity 

inland can be noted. This structure seems to be separated from the lower freshwater by an 

impervious clay layer. Far from the coastline the superficial resistivities are higher, but at 

bottom, 40 to 50 m bellow the mean sea level a conductive layer is present and extent all 

over the valley.

7.1.2.2 – Seca 2D data inversion 
 

The same spatially constrained algorithm has been applied to the soundings acquired in the 

Seca valley. As TEM soundings are along a line, the result can be approached to a 1D 

inversion with only laterally constrains (LCI). The overall mean distance between soundings 

was 175 m. Several inversion tests had been carried out, changing initial damping factor (?), 

different number of layers and different EDC values. 

 

A maximum of 40 iterations and a 0.02 rms value with a starting homogeneous resistivity 

model of 10 (or 20) ohm.m were adequate, with 15 layer model (till 80 m deep). Figure 7.30 

display the mean rms misfit versus maximum iteration number and number of pairs of 

soundings under EDC, all with the same starting conditions. The number of soundings within 

EDC grows up almost linearly with that parameter. The misfit decreases accordingly to about 

6% and better results occurs with more iterations.

sounding pair number (red square) for several constrained distances at Seca valley.

The quasi 2D global mean rms misfit is higher than mean 1D inversion models misfit. This is 

a consequence of the inversion process, as TEM soundings aren’t sufficiently closer to each 

other and because the model has layers with fixed geometry. Some 1D model’s results and 

soundings data fit is shown in figure 7.31 and below in figure 7.32, from the EDC highest 

models. Differences between both modelled sets are globally smaller than 10%. The overall 

resulting structure is similar to previous one obtained by stitched 1D models (figure 7.29).

the near sea, the superficial high resistivities inland and the conductive bottom. The same

Figure 7.34 shows some of the calculated 1D models at Picos valley, from near the shoreline 

upstream the valley. The corresponding measured TEM data and the model response are 

shown in figure 7.35. Signal noise was small with data errors growing in the last measured 

points. No major EM noise source exists. Some borehole and well pumps (mechanical) were 

running during the acquisition, but no major signal influence was detected. 

 

 

Figure 7.34 – Some 1D TEM mean models from Picos valley survey. 

 

 

Model responses have a mean 3 to 4% of misfit. The majority of the sounding curves 

decrease smoothly to low apparent resistivity values. The observed behaviour is similar to 

that in Seca valley with the corresponding aquifer system having bulk resistivity around 10 to 

20 ohm.m values.

Figure 7.35 – Several Picos TEM sounding curves and 1D mean model fit response. 

 

Like previously, the resistivity cross section was assembled from the 1D sounding models, 

calculated with the AEMR TEM inversion software (figure 7.36). This resistivity cross section 

is very similar to the Seca one, showing roughly the same resistivity values and spatial 

features. The corresponding deeper conductive layer is barely detected at some soundings. 

Near the coastline, the models and the cross section do not show the freshwater to seawater 

classical interface (as detected at S. Domingos). That’s also true in the Seca cross section. 

The same low resistivity shallow layer, coming from the sea is detected. The groundwater 

flux and pressure heads seems to setup the freshwater-seawater interface way and deeper 

to be detected by TEM soundings nearest to sea.

7.1.2.4 – Picos 2D data inversion 
 

The spatial distribution of the TEM soundings in Picos is almost under a straight line. To that 

situation, the spatially constrained algorithm methodology behaves like the 1D inversion with 

only laterally constrains (LCI). The overall mean distance between soundings was also of 

175 m. Inversion tests have been carried out like previously, changing initial damping factor 

(?), the number of layers and different EDC values.  



TEM MEASUREMANTS AND RESULTS

The maximum number of iterations was set to 40 and the rms value to 0.01 misfit. Initial 

model was again and always set to a homogeneous resistivity model of 10 ohm.m, with 15 

layers (till 80 m deep). Figure 7.37 display the mean rms model’s misfit to maximum iteration 

number and pairs of soundings in the EDC. The misfit is high with no lateral models 

influencing the inversion and becoming smaller, with the LCI influence, to a mean value of 

5%, with better results when more iterations take place. The number of pairs of soundings 

within EDC grows up almost linearly, alike Seca’s modelling. Again, quasi 2D global mean 

rms model’s misfit is higher than 1D inversion models mean misfit, by the same already 

exposed reasons.

Some 1D models and the corresponding data fit are shown below in figures 7.38 and 7.39,

of the different approach between methods. The resistivities are much alike and differences 

between both single and constrained models are of the same order, as previously.

7.1.2.5 – VLF and MT data comparison at Seca and Picos valleys 
 

The Seca and Picos TEM inverted models have been compared with previous 

electromagnetic profiles crossing both Seca and Picos valleys. The former studies comprise 

a 4 km long MT profile (9 stations) and several shorter VLF-EM ones, approximately oriented 

SE to NW and parallel to the coastline at 1 to 2 km way from it. A full description of this work; 

equipment, data processing and results are given in Santos el al. (2006). 

Figure 7.41 – VLF resistivity models (tipper component) for two cross sections at Seca valley 

and models from nearest TEM soundings. a) 750 m and b) 1400 m, from the coastline. 

(Adapted from figure 8, Santos el al. (2006)). 

 

The VLF resistivity cross sections are shown above, in figure 7.41, with some nearby TEM 

models stamped over. These VLF resistivity results must be taken as relative values, rather 

than absolute ones, because the VLF data are only the tipper component. The low resistivity 

values in TEM soundings seem to be in accordance with the resistivity decreasing suggested 

in the VLF models.

The 2D MT model cross section (from TE and TM-mode data joint inversion) is shown in 

figure 7.42. Although the broad-band MT method is being unsuited to investigate very 

shallow structures (less than 100 m deep), the resistivity values near the surface and also at 

major depths, have low values, especially beneath the valleys. The resistivity values are 

around 5 to 10 ohm.m, and these deeper structures could be related to the valley fault 

genesis and may be linked to some regional conductive groundwater up flow. 

 

 

7.1.3 – Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande data 
 

The Chão Bom in Tarrafal, is a flat area near the ocean, at the northwest side of Santiago 

Island. The Ribeira Grande stream valley is located just to the south of Tarrafal. The major 

difference to the remaining places is that Chão Bom is intensively farmed since many 

decades and is not crossed by any creek or stream system. It has approximately one square 

kilometre surface, with elevation from 5 to 20 m above msl. Several areas within Chão Bom 

had been severely affected by local salty water irrigation and were temporally abandoned. 

Nowadays, the situation is slowly reversing, with less salty water irrigation, as most of it 

comes from nearby mountain’s sources. The corresponding hydrographic catchment basin 

as 7.5 km
2
, 

 

The Chão Bom area is almost entirely covered by an alluvial deposit, surrounded (and 

overlying) by the PA formations (figure 7.43). This alluvium is manly formed by flood debris 

deposits with elements of a great variety in composition as well as in size and shape. This 

information comes from several lithological borehole descriptions at Tarrafal region (Dahlin et 

al., 1986 and INGRH). Superficial soil and alluvium are thinner with just a couple of meters at 

the south side of studied area, and have some six meters tick at the north side. In the 

southern area, under the initial layer, some pillow lava and scoria detritus are followed by 

fractured basalt until 28 m depth. From this level to 48 m depth, consolidated sandy alluvium 

is observed, being slightly clayey to the bottom. Bellow this, fragments of pillow lava exist. In 

the northern side and after the initial layer, a succession of fractured basalt with scoria and 

scoria layers exist until 49 m depth, sometimes with clayed inclusions. At Ribeira Grande, a 

stream valley with 20 to 30 m hillside high walls, the layers’ successions are almost entirely 

formed by altered and fewer altered basalts, with some clayed inclusions. Deepest drilled 

borehole at area goes to 35 m below the mean sea level. No direct geologic information is 

known beyond this limit. The Ribeira Grande hydrographic catchment basin covers 21.0 km
2
, 

 

The TEM survey has covered the agricultural area from the Tarrafal village limits, at north 

and east, to the coastline. In Ribeira Grande, soundings have been carried out from the 

seashore upstream the valley to 2 km m inland, and to 75 m elevation. The majority of the 

TEM-FAST 48 soundings were acquired with a 25 m × 25 m single loop wire, with a 

maximum current input of 3.0 ampere and time channel set to the maximum (9). The 

soundings’ location is shown at figure 7.43, over a regional geological map. Figure 7.44 

shows the TEM soundings’ location plus the boreholes and wells (with lithologic and 

chemical information) over a photographic image (Google image).

An analysis of the TEM apparent resistivity curves show that they have a similar behaviour, 

the medium is a mostly high conductor with resistivity decreasing with depth. In figures 7.46 

to 7.49 the overall krigged apparent resistivity distribution is mapped for eight increasing time 

windows after the turnoff. Inland, far from the coastline at higher places, the apparent 

resistivity values are high at the shallow depths and decrease towards the shoreline (lower 

elevation). The late time registered windows (deeper layers) have low apparent resistivity 

values all over the Chão Bom area. Near the northeast extreme, the very low apparent 

resistivity values linked to TEM number 11 are due to a disturbing coupling effect in the late 

time records (figures 7.48 and 7.49). This sounding was located very near the road and to 

several houses under construction, with ongoing work taking place.

7.1.3.1 – 1D inversion of TEM data from Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande 
 

Figure 7.50 shows the typical observed TEM curves at Chão Bom area (Tarrafal) and Ribeira 

Grande valley and their model response fitting. Measured noise was also in the 3 nVm
-2
 level 

but at some places unusual greater noise was registered. That’s most probably caused by 

locally grounded metallic fences. A couple of soundings had shown a resonant signal, easily 

smoothed during the inversion process. 

Figure 7.50 – Some Chão Bom and Ribeira Grande TEM curves and 1D mean model fit response. 

 

Model’s response misfits have a mean of 3 to 4%. Figure 7.51 shows the respective 1D 

mean model of the TEM soundings in figure 7.50. Most soundings exhibit high resistivity 

layers, with resistivity of 100 ohm.m or grater, from top to 20 to 30 m deep. Bellow this depth 

the bulk resistivity is clearly dominated by groundwater saturated layers. Measures at 

boreholes show that groundwater level is around 1 to 2 m above msl at 1 km inland (e.g.

SST-34 borehole) and near the sea level at the coastline (e.g. SST-32). The nearest 

sounding to borehole SST-34 is TEM 10 (figure 7.52). From the TEM model of this sounding 

it can be seen that the resistivity of 10 ohm.m corresponds to brackish and that deeper layer 

with 2.5 ohm.m resistivity corresponds to layers containing salty water. The measured 

groundwater resistivity was 4 ohm.m (1.3 mg.L
-1
 TDS) to less than 0.3 ohm.m.

The borehole lithology is represented below, in figure 7.53. As already mentioned most of the 

region is formed by fractured basalt, except in the southern area of Chão Bom plateaux, with 

some 20 m thick alluvium. Above the sea and at water saturated level, the majority of the 

measured and modelled high resistivity values (&gt;100 ohm.m) correspond to unsaturated or 

dry fractured basalt and scoria layers with some clay inclusions. These high resistivity layer’s 

values are usually the less determined model parameters (not well constrained) by the TEM 

method, with an ambiguity of 100 to 200% (e.g. Kafri and Goldman, 2005). 

 

Figure 7.53 – Boreholes lithologic description at Chão Bom, (Dahlin et al. (1986), and INGRH data). 

 

These high resistivity values confirm the results of a previous field study done at Chão Bom 

region by Dahlin et al. (1986). In the study (February 1986) VES resistivity measures 

(Schlumberger array), were done near the uncased (at that time) boreholes SST32, SST33 

and SST34. Measures have been done in two perpendicular directions. Figure 7.54 shows 

those soundings curves as well their corresponding resistivity models, for each perpendicular 

direction. 

 

The depth of the layers has been fixed by the borehole lithology data, as the two different 

direction’s VES models show discrepancies between them (Dahlin et al., 1986). These 

differences are due to the lateral effects originated by the inhomogeneous superficial 

geology, like blocks or stones, scattered throughout the area. In this (deep) conductive 

environment VES investigation is greatly shortened, and soundings are less effective to solve 

those deeper resistivity values.

Figure 7.54 – VES data at Chão Bom (Tarrafal) and 1D resistivity models (from Dahlin et al. (1986)). 

 

In these environmental conditions, where the uppermost layers are dry, it is expectable a 

worsen VES data quality. It’s also noted a huge difference between the resistivity values 

assigned to the bottom layer in VES and TEM models. That is explained when a comparison 

between both data sets is done using Meju’s scaling relationship (subchapter 4.3.1). Indeed, 

a considerable static shift exists as can be seen in figure 7.55, where the nearest TEM and 

VES soundings are compared. Although both data sets were acquired at different years and 

epochs, they have been done following the dry “rain season” condition of 1985 and 2005.

Figure 7.55 – Apparent resistivity VES (Dahlin et al., 1986).and TEM scaled data points 

comparison at Chão Bom (Tarrafal). 

 

Several resistivity cross sections were built using the 1D models calculated in the Chão Bom 

and Ribeira Grande valley. As previously, the same procedure was applied stitching together 

the 1D models, as can be seen in the next pages (figure 7.56 and 7.57). Resistivity cross 

sections are all plotted to the same resistivity colour scale. The profile location and direction 

are shown in figure 7.58. 

 

The overall resistivity structure at Chão Bom starts with high values (100 to 200 ohm.m) and 

20 m thick layer, matching dry basalts or quaternary alluvium. It is noted that the resistivity of 

this upper layer decreases towards the shoreline. The next layer, with resistivity range of 10 

to 20 ohm.m is mainly associated to the brackish water. Beneath this, the resistivity drops to 

1 to 2 ohm.m. This value is associated to salty water filling the pores/fractures of the rock 

(actual seawater or fossil water remains). As previously, the uniform horizontal continuity of 

resistivity layers from the first sounding towards the sea is just a graphical effect.

Figure 7.57 – Resistivity cross section at Chão Bom (parallel to the coastline), from 1D sounding 

models (top to bottom corresponds from inland to shoreline section). 

 

There is a difference between the Chão Bom northern and southern areas. The superficial 

layer is thicker and resistive in the southern part decreasing its resistivity towards the 

coastline. The most relevant and odd structural aspect from data, is that the deeper 

conductive layer (1 to 2 ohm.m resistivity) absolute level seems to get shallow inland. 

Considering the measured groundwater level and under a steady-state water flux condition, 

the theoretical position of the Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater-seawater interface is about 42 m 

below the mean sea level at sites nearest to the coastline. As the groundwater level 

increases inland, that interface would be increasingly deeper. 

 

Results from TEM soundings contradict this last assumption; they show that the conductive 

layer is roughly sub-horizontal and approaches the surface instead, as we go inland. 

Consecutively the low resistivity feature seems to be not linked to actual seawater intrusion 

but also to some high conductive lithologic layer. The same structure is detected upstream at 

Ribeira Grande valley cross section (figure 7.59). The thickness of this layer is difficult to 

quantify, because it is almost at the soundings’ depth investigation limit. In theory, with the 

available field data, it could be two or three tens of meters and can overlay a more resistive

layer (? 10 ohm.m or more). The differences at the late time in the soundings curves would 

be very small and wrapped by the signal noise.

7.1.3.2 – Chão Bom 3D data modelling 
 

The soundings at Chão Bom have been also inverted using the spatially constrained 

algorithm, a quasi-3D approximation. TEM sounding’s spatial locations are more or less 

uniform over the area. The overall mean distance between soundings was 205 m. Several 

modelling inversion tests had been carried out, changing the initial damping factor (?), the 

different number of layer and different EDC values. 

 

The following results were achieved with a maximum of 40 iterations, rms value of 0.02 and a 

starting homogeneous model with resistivity of 10 ohm.m and 16 layers (until 92 m deep). 

Figure 7.60 shows the final mean rms misfit variations with EDC parameter. The output for 

the first EDC value (45 m) is equivalent to a single sounding inversion (EDC set to zero). 

That’s because there aren’t soundings so close. With greater EDC values, models fit are 

slightly worsened because only a few soundings are included in the constraints. Beyond the 

mean inter sounding’s distance much more soundings are taking into account and 

increasingly better model’s fits outcome. 

 

From this quasi-3D modelling a few 1D model results and corresponding soundings’ data fits 

are presented below, in figures 7.61 and 7.62. The resulting models are similar to the 1D 

single inversion ones (figure 7.62). The mean global misfit between both sets around 8%.

At Chão Bom, soundings are almost uniformly separated, and it is possible to draw 

representative resistivity maps for several depths (figure 7.62). In the 0 m slice, the lowest 

resistivities are found near the shoreline. In the -50 m deep the resistivity value is uniform, 

around 1 ohm.m. At -25 m deep, it seems to exist a difference. That is certainly related to a

7.1.4 – Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel data 
 

Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel valleys are located 10 km to the north of Seca and Picos 

ones, near Calheta de S. Miguel village (figure 7.1). Salto and S. Miguel valleys are very 

narrow near the sea, with 300 and 150 m wide, respectively. Near the shoreline, Salto valley 

is limited by a 70 m hillside at north with a slope of 20 to 30 degrees and a gentler slope and 

less high south hillside. Inland, the valley spans wide to some 1.5 km. The hydrographic 

catchment in Salto covers around 12.4 km
2
. The S. Miguel valley is limited at both, north and 

south by 50 m hillside with slopes of 20 degrees. Inland, the valley spans from 500 m wide to 

1.5 km wide. S. Miguel hydrographic catchment covers 14.4 km
2
. The Flamengos valley has 

300 m side to side at the coastline, but it is wider with 1000 m between hillsides going inland. 

Those hillsides can reach 100 m above the valley floor with a slope of 30 degrees. The 

hydrographic catchment covers 30.5 km
2
. The three basins head starts are contiguous to the 

Serra da Malagueta mountain, one of the island regions with intense rainfall. Floods are 

frequent at these valleys in the course of the rainy season. All these valley creek beds are 

relatively flat and slowly increase the altitude with the upper creek course.

TEM soundings were acquired throughout the valley axis from the coastline, at roughly 6 m 

above msl, to 3500, 1600 and 3700 m inland, at 70, 20 and 100 m high, for Salto, Flamengos 

and S. Miguel, respectively. TEM sounding’s locations, with the numbering order starting all 

from the coastline and increasing upper creek valleys, are shown in figure 7.64, over the 

regional geology map. Soundings are also plotted over a photographic image (Google 

image), with the locations of boreholes and wells where lithologic and chemical groundwater 

data do exist (figure 7.65). 

 

Figure 7.65 – TEM soundings, boreholes and wells location at Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel 

valleys, (adapted from Google images). 

 

Borehole logs data from these valleys indicate a somewhat different geologic setting, when 

compared with those previously described. The Quaternary alluvium formation is very 

shallow and thinner, except to the downstream locations, that is, near shoreline. Together 

with the common basalt structures (more or less fractured) there are also pillow lava and 

greenish tuff layers. The deepest drilled borehole goes to 35 m below the mean sea level, 

and no direct geologic knowledge exists beyond this depth. 

 

Concerning the agriculture activities, they exist on those valleys but are restricted to the 

areas near the coastline at Salto and S. Miguel valleys. At Flamengos valley this agriculture 

practices extent further inland, to a couple of kilometres from the coastline. 

 

In figures 7.66 a) to c) it is showed the typical Salto and S. Miguel valley landscape scenario 

and environment. The landscape at Flamengos valley is not too much different.

7.1.4.1 – 1D inversion of TEM data from Salto 
 

TEM-FAST 48 soundings were acquired with a 25 m × 25 m single loop wire, with a 

maximum current input of 2.9 ampere and time channel set to 5. The observed noise was 

again at the same level of 3 nVm
-2
. Signal noise was very small. The error bar in the last time 

data is of 1 to 2% level. No man-made sources of EM noise or metallic fences were present) 

to produce coupling effects. The fourth sounding was located near a running well. Sounding 

acquisition was done with this pump turned on and off, and no difference was detected in the 

TEM data signal strength and noise level. The corresponding measured TEM data field 

curves and also the 1D mean fit response, is shown bellow (figure 7.67), for six of the twenty 

four acquired soundings.

Misfits have a mean 2 to 3%. Figure 7.68 shows the respective 1D mean model of the 

sounding in figure 7.67. The majority of the curves decrease smoothly to low apparent 

resistivity values of 7 to 10 ohm.m. 

 

Figure 7.68 – Some Salto valley 1D TEM mean models, corresponding to figure 7.67 soundings. 

 

The available lithologic logging information comes from three boreholes; FT 45, FT 47 and 

FT 49, located at mid profile, near TEM soundings 11, 13 and 16, respectively. Comparison 

between 1D models (figure 7.69) and the borehole lithology description (figure 7.70), shows 

a resistivity variation in 10 to 15 m depth, from higher to 10 ohm.m (TEM 11 and 13). This 

represents the groundwater level at the bottom of the superficial pillow lava layer (at 

unsaturated conditions). At these two soundings and bellow this position, only a deeper and 

less resistive layer (around 4 ohm.m) is detected, not having a correspondent geological 

changing in borehole description (FT 45 and TEM 11 are 100 m apart). At TEM 16 site, no 

pillow lava layers exist, instead we have greenish tuff, basalt and fractured basalt. 

Groundwater level coincides with the change in resistivity from lower to 6 ohm.m. The low 

resistivity values can be from altered tuff, probably with clay. Below this, at roughly 40 m 

depth, the resistivity increases probably due to the lithology change from tuff layer to basaltic 

and tuff layers. 

 

The groundwater level measures give a mean hydraulic gradient of 0.012.

From the groundwater samples, a seawater influence is plausible, as lowest resistivity values 

are nearest to the ocean ones, increasing upstream. At middle profile, the shallow layers are 

more resistive (50 to 100 ohm.m), most certainly due to dry pillow lavas. At the end of the 

profile the resistivity is somewhat low (10 ohm.m). This might be due to the high porosity of 

tuff and fractured basalts. 

 

 

7.1.4.2 – Salto 2D data inversion 
 

TEM soundings at Salto valley were acquired on a straight line. In this conditions the spatially 

constrained algorithm methodology becomes a 1D inversion with laterally constrains (LCI). 

The overall mean distance between soundings was 155 m. The modelling inversion tests had 

been carried as previously, changing initial damping factor, the number of layers and 

different EDC values. 

 

The maximum iteration was set to 60, and the rms value to 0.02. Initial model was always set 

to a homogeneous resistivity medium of 10 ohm.m, with 15 layers (until 80 m deep). Figure 

7.72 displays the mean rms misfit to maximum iteration number and number of soundings in 

the EDC. Misfit error is high with no lateral models influence and drop with LCI influence to a 

mean value of 1.2%, with almost equal results and iteration. The number of soundings within 

EDC grows up almost linearly because soundings are evenly spaced. In this particular case, 

the number of pair of soundings pairs seem not to have too much influence in individual 

models.

sounding pair number (red square) for several constrained distances at Salto valley. 

Initial damping factor set to 1.0 and 15 layers with 10 ohm.m model space. 

 

Some of the 1D models and corresponding soundings’ data fits are shown on next page, in 

figures 7.73 and 7.74, (mid-range EDC value of 450 m). Models are very similar to those 

from 1D inversion in spite of some scatter around uniform values due to the multi layer quasi-

2D method and prevailing data errors. The same multi layer method approach prevents also 

the sharp resistivity contrasts typical from 1D models. The mean differences between both 

model sets are globally smaller than 5%. The overall resulting structure presented in figure

7.1.4.3 – 1D inversion of TEM data from Flamengos 
 

TEM-FAST 48 soundings were acquired with a 25 m × 25 m single loop wire, with a current 

input of 1.0 ampere and time channel set to 5. The observed noise was also very small at the 

level of 3 nVm
-2
. Signal noise was very small with a bar error of the 1 to 2% level. No man-

made source of EM noise was present or metallic fences to produce coupling effects. The 

corresponding measured TEM data field curves and also its 1D mean responses, are shown 

bellow (figure 7.76), for six of the eight acquired soundings. 

 

Figure 7.76 – Some Flamengos measured TEM curves and 1D mean model fit response

 211

Model response misfits are of 2%. Figure 7.77 shows the respective 1D mean models of the 

soundings shown in figure 7.76. The majority of the curves decrease smoothly to low 

apparent resistivity values of around 5 to 6 ohm.m. 

 

Figure 7.77 – Some Flamengos valley 1D TEM mean models, corresponding to figure 7.76 soundings. 

 

The available lithologic logging description comes from a borehole far from the TEM profile 

(figure 7.78). The FT 5 borehole is located 4 km inland. Fractured basalt followed by more 

compact basalt with some tuff layers are the mean matrix. At mid valley and near the 

shoreline, a few meters thin alluvium layer exist. 

 

Most of the soundings exhibit a resistivity change at about 20 m depth from a higher value to 

near 10 ohm.m, approximately at the aquifer know depth. A thin conductive layer is also 

detected in most of the inland soundings, most certainly of clay origin. This layer can act as 

an impermeable horizontal barrier, if extended laterally and thus confining the aquifer locally. 

Below the 10 ohm.m aquifer layer, a deeper and less resistive layer takes place. As the 

measured groundwater level is some 5 m to 10 m below the surface at the start and end 

TEM profile (corresponding to a 0.014 hydraulic gradient), respectively, those layer’s 

interfaces cannot be linked to groundwater table and to deep fresh-seawater interface. With 

the given settings and considering a steady-state flux condition, the fresh-seawater interface 

should be deeper. The bottom conductive layer must be formed then by ancient salty layer 

deposits.

7.1.4.4 – Flamengos 2D data inversion 
 

At Flamengos valley, the TEM soundings have been taken almost over a straight line with a 

mean distance of 200 m between them, but not exactly at uniform spacing. The inversion of 

the all data set by the spatially constrained algorithm methodology becomes a 1D inversion 

with laterally constrains (LCI). The inversion tests were carried out as previously, changing 

initial damping factor, different number of layers and lately different EDC values. 

 

The maximum number of iterations was set to 40 and the rms value to 0.02. Initial model was 

set with resistive top layers (30 ohm.m) over a 10 ohm.m medium. The number of layers was 

11 (until 80 m deep) with an incremental step of 2??,????	?
. Like previously, data points were 

decimated (15 at each sounding). Figure 7.80 displays the mean rms misfit to the maximum 

number of iterations and pairs of soundings in EDC. The mean misfit value is around 3.5%, 

almost independent of EDC. Exception happens when no EDC influence exists, and the 

convergence stops after only 6 steps.

sounding pair number (red square) for several constrained distances at Flamengos valley. 

Initial damping factor set to 1.0 and 11 layers with 30 to 10 ohm.m model space. 

 

Some of the 1D models from the quasi-2D inversion and corresponding data fit are shown on 

the next page, in figures 7.81 and 7.82. Models’ outputs are similar to those obtained from 

individual 1D inversion in spite of some differences mostly related to layers fixed geometry 

and equivalent responses. The mean differences between both modelled sets are globally 

around 8%. The overall resulting structure presented in figure 7.83 is similar to previous one

at mid profile. The mean resistivities values in the aquifer depth range from 10 to 20 ohm.m, 

likewise, the former 1D model results. Higher superficial resistivities appear inland at the end 

of the profile. Near the coastline, it seems to be detected a superficial and a deeper seawater 

influence. At 40 m depth, below mean sea level a conductive layer is also detected, as seen 

in other valleys.

7.1.4.5 – S. Miguel 1D data inversion 
 

TEM-FAST 48 soundings were acquired with a 25 m × 25 m single loop wire, with a 

maximum current input of 2.8 ampere and time channel set to 5. The observed noise was 

again at the same low level of 3 nVm
-2
. Signal noise was very small at last time’s data (error 

bar of 1 to 2%). No man-made source of EM noise was present (metallic fences, etc.) to 

produce coupling effects. The corresponding measured TEM field curves and also the 1D 

mean model responses, are shown bellow (figure 7.84), for six of the twenty four acquired 

soundings.

The models’ responses have a mean misfit of 1 to 2%. Figure 7.85 shows the 1D models of 

the soundings shown in figure 7.84. The behaviour of the apparent resistivity curves is 

analogous to those acquired in other valleys: a smooth decrease to low apparent resistivity 

values (less than 10 ohm.m) is observed. 

 

 

Figure 7.85 – Some S. Miguel valley 1D TEM mean models, corresponding to figure 7.84 soundings. 

 

The available lithologic logging description comes from two boreholes (FT 68 and FT 70) 

near the coastline between TEM soundings 1 and 4, and one borehole located between TEM 

soundings 18 and 19, figure 7.86. Down course of the creek valley, near the shoreline the 

quaternary alluvium formation has some 30 m thick. At upper course, 3 km from the 

coastline, fractured basalt is again the main formation. Groundwater level in borehole and 

wells is about 5 m below the surface at TEM profile beginning and about 10 m at the profile 

end. Those levels correspond to a 0.020 hydraulic gradient throughout S. Miguel valley. 

 

Most of the soundings have an initial changing resistivity from a higher value (80 ohm.m) to 

about 10 to 20 ohm.m value, corresponding to the aquifer. The depth of this resistivity 

change match the water table at both TEM profile limits, were groundwater levels do exist. 

Similar to the previous Flamengos valley, the models at the middle profile also show a thin 

conductive layer between the uppermost and aquifer layers, probably of clay origin. This can 

again act out like an impervious horizontal barrier at mid valley. Below this 10 to 20 ohm.m

layer, a deeper and less resistive one exist from mid profile towards inland. With the given 

settings and assuming a steady-state flux condition, this bottom layer cannot be connected to 

the fresh-seawater interface as it should be much deeper. The bottom conductive layer must 

then be formed by ancient salty layer deposits. 

 

Figure 7.86 – Borehole lithologic description at S. Miguel valley (INGRH data). 

 

With all 1D TEM sounding models, a stitched cross section was built throughout the S Miguel 

valley. Figure 7.87 shows this cross section and also the groundwater resistivity and level 

below the surface, known from wells and boreholes positions.

7.1.4.6 – S. Miguel 2D data inversion 
 

The TEM soundings in S. Miguel valley are rather uniformly spaced throughout the valley. 

The spatially constrained algorithm methodology to 1D inversion with laterally constrains 

(LCI) was applied again to these soundings set. The overall mean distance between 

soundings was 170 m. The modelling inversion tests had been carried as previously 

changing initial damping factor, the number of layers and lately different EDC values. 

 

The maximum number of iterations was set to 60 and the rms value to 0.02. Initial model was 

set with resistive top layers (40 ohm.m) over a 10 ohm.m medium, with 15 layers models (till 

80 m deep). Figure 7.88 display the mean rms misfit versus maximum iteration number and 

pairs of soundings in EDC. Misfit error is high with no lateral influence and drop with that LCI 

influence, to a mean value of 1.2%, with almost equal results with more iterations.

Some of the 1D models obtained from quasi-2D inversion, and its corresponding data fit are 

shown in figures 7.89 and 7.90. Models are similar to those calculated from 1D individual 

inversion, in spite of some differences mostly related to layers fixed geometry and equivalent 

responses. The mean differences between both modelled sets are around 5%. 

 

 

Figure 7.90 – S. Miguel valley TEM data points and 1D model fit response from 

quasi-2D inversion, (corresponding to figure 7.89 models). 

 

 

The overall resulting structure is shown in figure 7.91. It’s comparable to the previous one 

obtained by stitched 1D models (figure 7.87), with plotting limitations. The mean resistivities 

values at aquifer depth range from 10 to 20 ohm.m, as given by former 1D model results. 

High superficial resistivities start one km from the ocean upstream the valley. Near the 

coastline, a seawater influence seems to be present. Inland a relatively deep conductive 

layer is also detected, like happened in other valleys.

7.2 – TEM data versus hydrologic parameters 
 

Starting from the TEM sounding data, the obtained and modeled bulk electric resistivity at 

several survey places is now compared to the available hydrologic parameters. These later 

ones came from natural springs, manmade wells and boreholes, as mention in the previous 

chapter sixth. This data includes EC measures, chemistry groundwater analyses and also 

some boreholes lithological description (already mentioned), water levels and transmissivities 

from a few pumping tests. The seawater EC was also measured, as a reference. The spatial 

distribution of all this data is uneven throughout most valleys and Santiago Island (INGRH). 

 

 

7.2.1 – Seca and Picos hydrologic parameters 
 

At Seca and Picos valleys, only a few borehole parameters are available. Regarding to 

groundwater EC, the number of samples (mainly from wells) is such that allows a 

groundwater electric resistivity map at the region. Most of the data comes from locations at 

the axis of both valleys. A rather extensive data was pull together at summer 2000. 

Significant EC changes are not observed in the course of the years at inland regions far from 

the shoreline. But, nearest the ocean, some important changes are known, as shown in 

figure 7.92 below. Some groundwater EC measured at wells in 2005 has been compared 

with previous ones, from year 2000. It’s clear a relationship between EC and the distance to 

the coastline. This behaviour is not just exclusive at Seca valley it seems to happen also at 

most of the farmed valleys of Santiago. 

 

Figure 7.92 – Groundwater EC (25 °C) increase versus sea distance, between 2000 to 2005 years, 

at Seca valley (from INGRH data). 

 

Figure 7.93 presents the condition in year 2000, before the electromagnetic field work (at the 

year 2005). It is clear the remarkable relation between the groundwater resistivity data and 

points’ distance to the coastline.

Taking into account the bulk resistivity values at aquifer depth (from TEM inversions) and the 

corresponding in-situ groundwater resistivity values, it is possible to calculate the formation 

factor (F) by expression (5.5). The table 7.2 below, exhibit such as results.

Doing a simple analysis of the calculated F values its worth remarking that all of them are 

rather small, with a mean value of 4.1 and 2.7, respectively to Seca and Picos. Apparently, 

there aren’t significant differences between F values at the beginning of the profile, near the 

coastline were alluvium is thicker, and the end of the profile, where the alluvium is much 

thinner, replaced by fractured basalt. Nevertheless, seems that formation factor values are 

decreasing from the shoreline, upwards the valleys, figure 7.94. 

Figure 7.94 – Formation factor versus sea distance, for Seca and Picos valleys. 

 

These values can be directly translated into porosities via Archie first law (5.11b). Table 7.3 

summarizes this calculation with three sets of parameter’s values (a and m), typical for 

alluvium (higher values) and fractured basalts (lower values) environments. These porosities 

seem rather high, especially at the lowest formation factor values, but are within the range of 

values published for this sort of lithology. 

 

Table 7.3 – Mean porosities from formation factor values, at Seca and Picos valleys. 

Valley F a = 0.6 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1.4 

Seca 4.1 0.15 0.24 0.37 

Picos 2.7 0.22 0.37 0.49 

 

Several factors may affect the values of the formation factor. The clay content dispersion 

throughout alluvium, and throughout fractured basalts, and its cation exchange capacity 

(CEC). Or to a much lesser extent, a low bulk resistivity value due to the equivalence 

problems in the inversion process. Thin clay layers and clayed inclusions are reported in the 

alluvium and also in basaltic formations. Concerning the clay surface conductivity influence, 

the analyses of the bulk resistivity versus groundwater EC available data seems to indicate a 

real effect (figure 7.95), which will produce always a major correction at the lower 

groundwater EC places. At Picos the data fit is worse because it shows high data scattering 

at low conductivities. The surface conduction term (?
) has been estimated from the 

extrapolated intercept when groundwater EC is set to zero (Waxman and Smits, 1968), using 

a power fit function (see figure 7.95).

Applying Archie’s second law (5.12), with the mean calculated correction, ?S = 592 µS.cm
-1
 

to Seca valley and ?S = 653 µS.cm
-1
 to Picos valley the mean porosity values became 

(excluding the highest bulk resistivities ones) as following (table 7.4): 

Figure 7.95 – Bulk versus groundwater EC relation, (continuous line - fit function, dotted lines - plus 

and less one standard deviation fit function), for Seca and Picos valleys. 

 

Table 7.4 – Mean porosities from corrected formation factor values, at Seca and Picos valleys. 

Valley F a = 0.6 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1 a = 1 , m = 1.4

Picos 5.4 ± 2.2 0.11 ± 0.07 0.19 ± 0.10 0.30 ± 0.12 

 

This is assuming an effective porosity (connected porosity structure) equal to the porosity 

given by Archie’s law. These ranges of porosity values can be compared against the 

available transmissivities values from pumping tests at boreholes FT-63 and FBE-169 

(inland, near last TEM Seca sounding), which have both about 60 m
2
d

-1
. At thick alluvium 

formation, the transmissivities values are usually higher in one order, 600 m
2
d

-1
 (Gomes, 

2007). With the assumption of a 40 m thick aquifer system, the hydraulic permeability 

becomes respectively 3×10

 m
2
 and 3×10

-11
 m

2
, (and K = 1.5 and 15 m.d

-1
, to a confined 

aquifer hypothesis).  

 

Porosity can be estimated taking the K-C relation for the sedimentary environment 

(expression (5.7b)), and the expression (5.6) for the fractured basalt environmental 

(assuming that it acts identically to granular porosity when it is densely fractured) with an 

equivalent grain diameter at least as 8 times the inner fractured radius channels. The results 

are given in table 7.5. The lithologic description of the alluvium sedimentary formation has no 

reference to be coarse sandy, so the porosity must be in 15 to 25% range with a mean grain 

particle diameter below 0.3 mm (equivalent to medium to fine sand). Sediments in Picos 

valley have higher porosity and fine grained materials than sediments in Seca valley. 

Fractures at the basaltic formations seem to exist below the 0.15 mm equivalent D50 value 

(10 µm inner radius), with porosities in the 10% (in Seca) to 20% (in Picos) range. That inner 

radius fractures give a specific surface area (Sp, known as SSA) around 0.1 m
2
g

-1
, a common 

value at basaltic formations (Nielsen and Fisk, 2008).

Although there is no information about the clay composition (detected at many borehole logs) 

an assessment of CEC amount value for the mean porosity was tried. From the W-S models 

and their relations (chapter 5, expressions 5.13 to 5.15) assuming a specific weight (density) 

of 2500 kg.m

 and cementation index of 1.0, the mean CEC estimated value is: 1.7 

meq
+
/100 g to 15% porosity for Seca valley and 2.5 meq

+
/100 g to 20% porosity for Picos 

valley. These are low CEC values but nevertheless, affecting bulk resistivity values. As there 

is an intrinsic relationship between CEC and porosity, none of them having independent 

measures, only a rough idea on the spatial distribution of CEC can be made (figures 7.96 

and 7.97).

7.2.2 – Salto, Flamengos, and S. Miguel hydrologic parameters 
 

At Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel valleys, a few more parameters exist, but fewer 

groundwater EC values measured in samples from wells and boreholes. Although the density 

of points per stream valley is much smaller, it allows the plotting of a groundwater electric 

resistivity map for the entire region. Figure 7.98 presents the condition at summer of 2000. 

Again, it is clear the remarkable relation between groundwater resistivity and sea distance. 

Figure 7.98 – Krigged groundwater resistivity map from manmade well and borehole data points, 

at Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel valleys (year 2000), (from INGRH data). 

 

Taking the modelled bulk resistivity values of the aquifer at each TEM sounding (closer to the 

well where groundwater EC is known), an estimation of the formation factor was calculated. 

Table 7.6 in the next page exhibits such results for those three valleys. The formation factors 

are again very low (near 3.0), exception of a few values at Flamengos valley. Conversion to 

porosities, by Archie first law, will give high to very high porosity values, as seen below in 

table 7.7. This table includes also the corrected formation factors by surface conductivity 

effect from clay dispersion throughout the lithologic formations. The bulks versus 

groundwater EC are plotted in figure 7.99 for the three surveyed valleys.

These porosity range values were also compared against the available transmissivities, from 

local pumping tests at boreholes FT-5 and FBE-145 (inland, at Flamengos valley). Both have 

low values at the 2 to 5 m

 range, which is typical for the Flamengos formation lithology 

(Gomes, 2007). Near the coastline, where the alluvium formations are thicker, the 

transmissivities are again much higher, around the 600 m

The corresponding mean grain diameter of alluvium formation and equivalent grain diameter 

for fractured basaltic formation are given at table 7.8. At the alluvium sedimentary formation, 

porosity must be in the 20 to 30% range with particle mean size around 0.2 mm (equivalent 

to fine sand). Porosity seems to grow from Salto (at south) to S. Miguel, but this could be 

biased with this so little data amount. Fractures at basaltic formations seem to exist below 

the 0.06 mm equivalent D50 value (2 µm inner radius), with porosities in the 10 to 20% range, 

with Salto valley in the former limit and S. Miguel valley in the later limit. This fractures inner 

radius gives a SSA value around 0.3 m

The measured seawater EC value is of 56100 µS.cm
-1
 (25 °C) (Mota Gomes, private 

communication). For this seawater conductivity, the calculated salinity is around S = 37.2, i.e. 

a TDS content of 37200 mg.L
-1
 (Kennish, M., 1989). This seawater 0.18 ohm.m electric 

resistivity value is compared with TEM soundings carried out near to sea, where apparent 

resistivities show deeper seawater influence other than just the shallower one. This would be 

always the best procedure to get better porosity results (Kafri, Goldman, 2005). At Salto the 

corrected and uncorrected formation factors are 9.4 and 8.4, respectively for first sounding. 

At Flamengos they are respectively, 12.0 and 10.3, and at S. Miguel the calculated values 

are 6.5 and 6.0, respectively. All these values are higher than those calculated and 

discussed above, by some 50% at Salto and S. Miguel. At Flamengos, the offset value is

even higher. Explanation to this could be that water is not “pure seawater”, but a rather very 

high saline mixture. Nevertheless, this implies that former mean formation factors must be 

taken at higher limit and that porosities are consequently small, and must be at the low limit 

as well. Table 7.9 below, summarize these values. Porosities at fractured basalts (including 

tuffs) must be considered with a mean value around 10 to 15%. 

 

Table 7.9 – Mean porosities from seawater corrected formation factor values,

The consequent mean CEC value for these data sets gives the following results: 1.5

+
/100 g to 15% porosity at Flamengos

previously found. 

 

 

7.2.3 – S. Domingos hydrologic parameters 
 

At S. Domingos’s valley, the numbers of manmade wells are even smaller. The few ones 

near the sea are dry from time to time. The only available groundwater EC measures at mid 

valley come from a few boreholes there, together with their lithologic description. Borehole 

FT-40 is at mid valley between TEM soundings 26 and 27, with a measured groundwater EC 

of 1375 µS.cm
-1
. From year 2003 to 2006 FT-40 EC values had only 25 µS.cm

-1
 variations. 

The modelled bulk resistivity values at aquifer depth from TEM 26 and 27 soundings are 12.2 

and 11.6 ohm.m, respectively. With these values, the formation factor becomes F = 1.65, a 

rather small one. If a clay conductivity surface correction with ?S = 600 ± 100 µS.cm

the corresponding TEM models’ bulk resistivity of 1.6 ± 0.3 ohm.m, the formation factor 

becomes now F = 9.0 ± 1.6. This is again some 50 % plus that early simple corrected

With these parameters and the modelled TEM bulk resistivity values at aquifer’s depth, the

shoreline. Results are given below in figure 7.100. The shallow groundwater resistivity is 

extremely low nearest to sea (0.3 to 0.8 ohm.m) and becomes progressively more resistive 

with sea distance. At 1000 m distance onwards, mean resistivity is near 7 ohm.m value. 

Similar values were measured beyond TEM 37 at borehole FT-42 and on more five wells, 

3500 m from the coastline (1500 m behind this last sounding).

7.2.4 – Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande hydrologic parameters 
 

At Tarrafal (Chão Bom) and Ribeira Grande valley only a small number of manmade wells 

have EC and water level’s measures. These wells are all nearby each other and close to the 

sea, at SW Chão Bom. Some of the few boreholes have lithologic description, groundwater 

EC measures and only one Transmissivity value (FT-29 borehole). Figure 7.101 below, show 

the linear relation between groundwater resistivity versus sea distance, starting from the sea 

with values below one ohm.m. This must represent a fresh to seawater mixture as 

groundwater level is barely above the sea level at all this near sea area. 

 

Figure 7.101 – Groundwater resistivity versus distance to the sea, 

at Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley. 

 

Direct comparison between these water values and TEM modelled bulk resistivity gives a 

formation factor of F = 9.2 ± 2.8 (without any clay superficial conductivity correction) for the 

shallow fractured basalt. With these values, a porosity range can be calculated (table 7.13).

Porosity for this shallow basaltic layer near the sea must be around 10%. 

 

The available groundwater EC logging measures in SST-33 and SST-34 boreholes (Dahlin et 

al., 1986), show that 25 to 30 m below the mean sea level values are less than 0.3 ohm.m, 

i.e. it is a high degree salty rich mixture water or even seawater. On this assumption, with a 

0.18 ohm.m seawater resistivity value, the formation factor is calculated to this deep level, 

from the TEM bulk resistivity values. Mean formation factor value is F = 6.2, ranging from 2.8

to 16.7. Figure 7.102 shows the corresponding formation factor map. With these resistivity 

values, any correction by clay superficial conductivity adds at most some more 10 to 20%. 

 

Figure 7.102 – Formation factor map at Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley, 30 m below sea level. 

 

It is evident, as previous quasi-3D models showed (figure 7.61), a NE-SW oriented feature at 

south Chão Bom area. This must be certainly related to the lithologic variation described 

between SST-33 and SST-34 boreholes (figure 7.53), from deep alluvium layers (at south) to 

fractured basaltic and pyroclastic formations (at north). 

 

The known transmissivity value at FT-29 is high, around 7000 m

d

-1
 (fractured basalts). That 

means also a very high value of 2×10
-10

 m
2
 for hydraulic permeability, with 40 m thick aquifer 

system assumption (and K = 175 m.d
-1
, to a confined aquifer hypothesis). The analogous 

equivalent grain diameter for this fractured basaltic formation is around 0.5 mm, with fracture 

internal radius of 50 µm. This gives a porosity range between 15 to 30% and a SSA around 

0.01 m
2
g

-1
. If this transmissivity value is over estimated, porosities are necessarily lower. 

Nevertheless, the high formation factor area at north Chão Bom is probably a low porosity 

zone (below 10 to 15%) and the orientated feature a higher porosity one (above 25 to 30%).

7.2.5 – Hydrologic parameters 
 

The groundwater recharge rates for each valley were calculated knowing the basin spatial 

development at each bioclimatic zone and annual mean precipitation rate and recharges 

percentages (subchapter 6.4.1.). The annual extraction rates have been estimated 

approximately half of those values at most of the basins (INGRH reports). Half of this 

groundwater exploitation goes to agriculture land irrigation, which implies a partial water 

return of 10 to 20% to the soil. The natural water springs discharge can reach also 15 to 20% 

of annual recharge, and all these major watersheds are linked to the water-supply network of 

the island. 

 

The amount of incoming and natural discharge to the sea (direct or indirect) is shown at table 

7.14, assuming a steady-state flux condition. Daily mean discharge is presented, as also the 

hydraulic transmissivity and conductivity estimation (at basin scale), with a given shoreline 

wide and useful thickness of 40 m discharge, and a global 15% porosity, by simple 

application of Darcy’s law.

. Picos and Seca, K = 1.5 to

 and S. Domingos, K = 1.75 m.d

. Explanation for these differences can be ascribed 

to a changing scale factor of the hydraulic transmissivity between local and regional flow path 

behavior and to variable lithologic conditions at both local and regional (or borehole and 

basin) scales. The mean recharge rates can be overestimated, as detailed spatial 

parameter’s description trough time is not complete and major changes are detected 

between the basins on the same year. Also, the deeper groundwater discharge may include 

a substantial fraction of submarine groundwater discharge, directly into the ocean.

7.3 – TEM versus Hydrochemical data 
 

Several chemical analyses have been done from water samples collected at natural springs, 

wells and boreholes. The most important water elements and compounds were measured to 

assign water type and saturation conditions. Comparison to bulk modelled resistivity from 

TEM data is now analysed and relations between both data sets are sought after. 

 

 

7.3.1 – Groundwater salt origins 
 

The global chemical characteristic of the groundwater at Santiago Island was already 

presented in chapter 6. Geochemical data sub-set matching the worked valleys (and several 

others near the sea) show a predominant NaCl water facies. The source of this groundwater 

type and measured salinity could arise from seawater encroachment inland or by a different 

process or source mechanism. These later ones could comprise entrapped ancient (fossil) 

seawater, physic-chemical evaporate rock dissolution, sea-spray accumulation over time, 

displacement of ancient saline groundwater from adjacent aquifer or aquitard by thermal 

convection or natural advection, aquitards leaking through existing faults and lately by human 

related activities (pollution) from sewage effluents and agriculture practices and return flows. 

All these can contribute to groundwater salt increase, (Custodio, 1997). 

 

The natural and starting point should be the direct comparison to local seawater composition 

(figure 7.103). Seawater exhibit in general a uniform chemical composition over time, with 

marked features like the predominance of Cl
-
 and Na

+
 (with molar Na/Cl = 0.86), an excess 

of chloride over the alkali ions (Na and K) and also Mg
2+

 greatly in excess over Ca
2+

 (about 

four to five times). Further solute differentiation between ground- and seawater can be done, 

with the latter one having Mg &gt; HCO3 + SO4. The ground meteoric waters (even with marine 

salt’s re-solution), have Na &gt; Cl. These waters can carry significant Ca, in excess over HCO3 

+ SO4 due to diagenetic carbonate or silicate reactions, (Jones et al., 1999).

7.3.2 – Criteria to distinguish saltwater intrusions 
 

As the groundwater salinity can have different sources, the distinction of these different 

salinization mechanisms is crucial to apply a correct water-resource management program, 

with discrimination between modern seawater intrusion and relics of entrapped brines within 

or underlying aquifers. The interpretation of the salinization process should be based upon 

geological and hydrochemical criteria and data (chemical e isotopic). Several geochemical 

criteria had been suggested to identify the origin of salinity, especially the detection of 

seawater intrusion in opposition to other salinity sources in coastal aquifers, (Jones et al., 

1999), and should be used altogether to clearly delineate the situation. 

 

 

Salinity values – because of the contrast between marine and typical continental anion 

matrices, the clearest indication of a possible seawater intrusion is the increase of Chloride 

concentration as a proxy for salinity (although other processes may lead to a similar 

phenomenon). In coastal aquifers, where continuous overexploitation can cause a reduction 

of the piezometric level, the intrusion of seawater results in a salinity breakthrough. Thus, 

time-series of chloride concentrations (e.g. at seashore boreholes) can record the early 

evolution of a relatively rapid salinization process. 

 

Br/Cl ratio – the Bromide to Chloride ratio can be used as a reliable tracer, because both Cl 

and Br usually behave conservatively (i.e., do not react with the aquifer solid matrix) except 

in the presence of very high amounts of organic matter (Davis et al., 1998). Seawater (Br/Cl 

molar ratio of 0.0015) is distinguished from relics of evaporated seawater (hypersaline brines 

Br/Cr &gt; 0.0015, Dead Sea = 0.011 (Starinsky et al., 1983)), evaporite-dissolution products 

(below 0.00045) and anthropogenic sources like sewage effluents (Br/Cl above 0.00055) 

(Vengosh and Pankratov, 1998) or agriculture-return flows (high Br/Cl ratios). (The global 

analyses of groundwater Br/Cl ratio in Santiago had been written at chapter 6). 

 

Na/Cl ratio – the Na/Cl ratio of saltwater intrusion are usually lower than the marine values 

(i.e., bellow molar ratio of 0.86). Thus low Na/Cl ratio, combined with other geochemical 

parameters, can be an indicator of the arrival of saltwater intrusion, even at relatively low 

Chloride concentrations during the first early stages of salinization. The low Na/Cl ratio of 

seawater intrusion is distinguishable from the high Na/Cl ratio (above unit), typical of 

anthropogenic sources, like domestic waste waters. (The global analyses of groundwater 

Na/Cl ratio in Santiago was also written at chapter 6). 

 

Ca/Mg, Ca/(HCO3 + SO4) ratios – as already mention, one of the most conspicuous features 

of seawater intrusion is the enrichment of Ca over its concentration in seawater. High Ca/Mg 

and Ca/(HCO3 + SO4) ratios (&gt;1) are further indicators of arrival of seawater intrusion. It 

worth mention, however, that saline water with high Ca can be originated by a different 

mechanism, not necessarily related to base-exchange reaction and modification of modern 

seawater.

different slopes due to evaporation processes that would change the isotopic composition of 

the saline end-member. (The global analyses of O and H isotopes in Santiago, was also 

written at chapter 6). 

 

Boron isotopes – The Boron isotopic composition of groundwater can be a powerful tool for 

discrimination of salinization sources, in particular, distinguishing seawater from 

anthropogenic fluid such as domestic waste water. The ?
11

B values of saltwater intrusion 

range over 30‰ to the seawater value (?
11

B = 39‰), reflecting mixing of freshwater and 

seawater in coastal areas. 

 

7.3.3 – Groundwater chemical modification 
 

As the chemical composition of a coastal salty groundwater can deviate significantly from just 

a simple conservative seawater-freshwater mixing (Appelo and Geirnart, 1991) the criteria 

mentioned above should be used with care, when looking for groundwater salt origin. Most of 

this deviation can be ascribed to water-rock interactions (Appelo and Postma, 1993), with the 

principal one being ion exchange with clay materials (Appelo and Willemsen, 1987) and also 

carbonate dissolution-precipitation processes (Fidelibus and Tulipano, 1986). When the 

concern chemical parameters behave conservatively, they can be used to estimate the 

different source contributions, therefore, the use of Cl, Br and Deuterium. Otherwise they can 

carry information on the solid matrix extended interaction (e.g. B and Sr isotopes), (Morell et 

al., 1996). The four basic reactions associated with the hydrogeologic environmental setups 

of seawater intrusion are; the water mixing, and that includes evaporites associated fluids, 

carbonate precipitation and dolomitization, ion exchange and silicate (clay) diagenesis, and 

redox reactions, (Jones et al., 1999). 

 

Mixing – when freshwater and seawater mixing occur, a small amount of this latter is 

sufficient to overcome and dominate groundwater chemical composition. A 5% seawater 

contribution outputs groundwater salinity with more than 1 g Cl.l
-1
. As a result, Chloride is 

used as a very sensitive mixing indicator and also the ionic Na/Cl ratio of seawater will 

dominate its chemical composition (assuming conservative behaviour). Stables O and H 

isotopes are also used to ascribe the mixing amount, as freshwater is in general depleted in 

both 
18

O and 
2
H relative to seawater (Manzano et al., 1990 and Izbicki, 1996). 

 

Exchange reactions in water-rock interaction – cation exchange in seawater intrusion 

plays a key role, and has been treated and detailed by Appelo and Postma (1993). The 

freshwater is usually dominated by Ca
2+

 and HCO3
-
 ions (mostly from calcite dissolution). 

Therefore, the cation exchangers in aquifers such as clay minerals, organic matter or fine 

grain rock materials, have mostly Ca
2+

 absorbed at their surfaces. In contrast to this, the 

sediments in contact with seawater have Na
+
 as the most prevalent absorbed cation (Sayles 

and Mangelsdorf, 1977). When seawater intrudes on a coastal freshwater aquifer, ion Na
+
 

replaces part of the Ca
2+

 ion at the solid surface. In such reaction, Na
+
 is taken up by the 

solid phase, and Ca
2+

 is released and the solute composition changes from NaCI to CaCl2

 238

facies (Custodio, 1987, Appelo and Postma, 1993). Moreover, as the Chloride ion 

concentration remains unaffected by this trade reaction, it can be regarded as a reference 

parameter, as mention before. Consequently, as seawater intrudes on coastal aquifers 

containing freshwater, the Na/Cl ratio decreases and the (Ca + Mg)/Cl ratio increases. Under 

such conditions, the enrichments in Calcium and Magnesium should be balanced by the 

depletion of Sodium. Accordingly, the decrease in Na/Cl ratio balances the increase in (Ca + 

Mg)/CI ratio (Custodio, 1987). Upon inflow of freshwater the reverse process takes place, 

with the increase of the Na/Cl ratio and a decrease of the (Ca + Mg)/CI ratio value, and 

formation of NaHCO3 fluid facies. In addition to the expected development of a CaCl2 water 

type at the seawater front, a significant increase in Mg
2+

 also takes place. These increased 

levels are congruent at first, but when the Ca from exchange runs out, the trends of the two 

ion concentrations diverge afterwards - the Ca
2+

 decreases and Mg
2+

 increases towards its 

higher concentration value in seawater. In fact, because of the relatively small amount of 

exchanged Ca compared to even the relatively low Ca level maintained by CaCO3 saturation 

of the saline water, the decrease of Ca content as already begun before the Chloride 

reaches the seawater concentrations (Appelo and Postma, 1993). 

 

It is also known that when seawater intrusion into groundwater is primarily by diffusion rather 

than advection, and the cation exchange capacity of the sediment are low, the effects of ion 

exchange tend to be considerably reduced, and the resulting water compositions will 

resemble a simple mixture of fresh and saline water (Appelo and Postma, 1993). 

 

Carbonate Diagenesis and Dolomitization – Plummer (1975) and Wigley and Plummer 

(1976) have shown the effects of speciation in the mixing of dilute carbonate groundwater 

with seawater when coastal aquifers are composed of some carbonate materials, either of 

calcareous clastics or of limestone. The mixing of dilute groundwater in equilibrium with 

calcite with common seawater that is supersaturated with respect to calcite can produce 

solutions of intermediate composition that are undersaturated with respect to calcite. Besides 

this, products in the mixture might be undersaturated with respect to calcite but 

supersaturated with respect to dolomite, as several authors have shown (Jones et al., 1999 

and references thereafter). The extent of this calcite undersaturation and dolomite 

supersaturation, is strongly dependent on temperature and also heavily dependent on the 

solubility of dolomite, which is stronger for very finned grain forms. The dolomitization 

process, in which calcite and dolomite are in equilibrium results in a progressive enrichment 

of Ca over Mg in solution (i.e., Ca/Mg ratio increases). Therefore, saline water affected by 

dolomitization processes should be characterized by high Ca content and by a CaCl 

signature (i.e., Ca/(HCO3 + SO4) &gt; 1) (Starinsky et al., 1983; Carpenter, 1978). The formation 

of dolomite in modern marine sediments and sediment burial to shallow depths is strongly 

controlled by the reaction kinetic that is slow even at high supersaturation, (Morse and 

Mackenzie, 1990). 

 

Adsorption and organic matter reduction – One of the processes that modifies the 

seawater intrusion chemistry is adsorption onto clay minerals in the host aquifer. The 

elements that are sensitive to adsorption process are Potassium, Boron and Lithium. The 

adsorption process resulted in low K/Cl, B/Cl and Li/Cl ratios in the residual saline 

groundwater relative to the marine ratios (of K/Cl = 0.02 at seawater).

The seawater encroachment and the formation of a relatively static interface zone between 

overlying fresh and underlying saline water, may produce local low redox conditions, due to 

the decomposition of dissolved organic matter, of organic-rich sediment or fine suspended 

organic particulate, as mention by Schoeller (1956), Custodio and Liamas (1976), Hem 

(1985). According to Custodio et al., (1987), this process will cause changes in pH, and the 

reduction of dissolved sulfate to H2S, resulting in low SO4/Cl ratio. These changes shift the 

calcium carbonate equilibria and most commonly cause dissolution. The resulting increase in 

the Calcium content is frequentiy masked by exchange of Ca
2+

 for Mg
2+

 or Na
+
 on clays 

previously equilibrated with more seawater like cation matrices. Intense and episodic nature 

of rainfall, lack of soil cover, well developed fractures and fissures and shallow depth of the 

vadose zone, all contribute to significant inputs of organic matter to the freshwater lens, 

Whitaker and Smart (2007). This generates potential for dissolution considerably greater 

than that predicted solely by simulations of inorganic mixing between basal freshwater lens 

waters and underlying saline groundwaters. 

 

Fossil Seawater intrusion – in the coastal areas, if entrapped fossil seawater exists at 

unflushed parts of the aquifer, they can also affect the quality of adjacent fresh groundwater. 

Fossil seawater could have originated from past invasions of coastal aquifers accompanying 

the sea level rises. However, it has been difficult do date this saline groundwater and to 

evaluate the timing and time rate of seawater intrusion. The evidence for ancient seawater is 

primarily from tritium and radiocarbon dating, as ascribed at chapter 6. The 
l4
C content of 

fresh and saline groundwater is a result of complex contributions from different sources, 

including the original seawater, soil CO2, carbon derived from dissolution of the carbonate 

matrix, and carbon derived from decomposition of organic matter. But the 
14

C budget can be 

affected by the processes occurring in seawater encroachment. These include interaction of 

interstitial water with bottom sea sediments and with the aquifer matrix. Consequently, 
14

C 

interpretation requires additional chemical and 
13

C supporting data. Another indirect 

evaluation of the age of saline groundwater is ?
18

O value of saline water. Groundwater with 

depleted 
18

O lower than that of modern atmospheric recharge reflects past replenishment 

when the ?
18

O of precipitation was lower. Also, groundwater dissolved noble gases (He, Ne, 

Ar, Kr and Xe) analyses can be applied to support and adds constraints to the radiocarbon 

data (Aeschbach?Hertig et al., 1999). 
 

 

7.3.4 – Hydrochemical data at S. Domingos valley 
 

At S. Domingos valley, groundwater chemical data have been taken from two boreholes; the 

FT-40 and the FT-42, at two epochs, before (June) and after (December) the traditional rain 

season. Table 7.15 includes some values and ratios related to water quality. Borehole FT-40 

is located at mid TEM profile and FT-42 past last inland TEM sounding. Both have NaCl 

water types (figures 7.104 to 7.106). The measured EC, TDS, pH and Chloride are almost 

identical (exception for a major Cl decrease at FT-42). Both groundwaters are 

undersaturated relative to Calcite and Aragonite. The TDS and Chloride amounts are above 

the freshwater threshold limit of 0.5 g.L
-1
. These values are not directly related to present 

time seawater intrusion, according to several ratios values. Those high values can have two 

different origins:: can be linked to some upwelling of trapped ancient seawater (by a diffusion

process or due to the overexploitation) and mixing into the shallow groundwater, by natural 

discharge from mainland, or by sewage effluents and agriculture activities, as Nitrate values 

are high and the pH decrease can be from organic matter origin. The measured variations 

agree with the shallow waters flush in the rainy season. The answer is that most certainly 

both situations are taking place at those places as TEM resistivity models had shown, a 

deeper high conductive layer exists and also because villages are placed around and above 

the valley. The intense overexploitation as a mean to explain the increasing salinization by 

mixing is taken as a hypothesis by Carreira et al. (2010), as a result of geochemical and 

isotopic analysis study of 36 inland groundwater samples. That includes also the Tritium 

content at FT-40 water, which is null and point to a higher residence time.

7.3.5 – Hydrochemical data at Seca and Picos valleys 
 

At Seca valley, groundwater chemical analysis exists at three boreholes; FT-9 near mid TEM 

profile and FT-63 and FBE-169 near the last TEM sounding, (table 7.16). All are a NaCl 

water type with also a major Mg content (figures 7.107 to 7.110). The measured EC, TDS, 

pH and Chloride does not change significantly over time. All are undersaturated of Calcite 

and Aragonite. The measured TDS values are slightly above 0.5 g.L
-1
. The majority of Na/Cl 

ratios are near the unit value and the ratios with Ca are low. That means that the salinity is 

not related to present time seawater intrusion whatsoever. The mechanism is similar to that 

one found in S. Domingos valley, but to a lesser extent. At Seca, agriculture practices are 

more intense and salinity seems to be related also to anthropogenic factors (high values of 

Nitrate are detected). Nevertheless, the Magnesium by Calcium ions trade can be also 

masking the water mixing from deep conductive salty layer.

At Picos valley, groundwater chemical analysis exists at three boreholes; FT-59 is just 

beyond last TEM sounding, and SP-34 and SP-39 at mid and near start TEM profile, 

respectively, at north, above the valley, (table 7.17). Water facies is different; the water at 

SP-34 is of NaCl type while the other two are of Na-, Mg- or Ca-HCO3 types, (figures 7.111 

to 7.113). In all of them, TDS values exceed the limit of 0.5 g.L
-1
. SP-39 groundwater is of 

NaHCO3 type and supersaturated of Calcite and approximately saturated of Aragonite. 

Although being the nearest to shoreline, it is outside the valley, and its salinization comes 

from a water-rock interaction process. Water facies in SP-34 and FT-59 is compatible with 

some deep salty water mixing. Besides this, the mixing may also indicate an influence of the 

agriculture activities. Tritium value is null at borehole SP-39 and less than 1 T.U. at borehole 

FT-59, that implies several decades of residence time (Carreira et al., 2010).

7.3.6 – Hydrochemical data - Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel valleys 
 

At Salto valley, groundwater chemical analysis exists from two places; well 52-81 near sea 

and near the beginning of the TEM profile, and borehole FT-47 at mid profile, (table 7.18). 

The water type in the well is MgCl to CaCl and in the borehole is NaCl type, (figures 7.114 to 

7.116). All samples have TDS values above the 0.5 g.L
-1
 threshold. At the well, the ratios 

indicate a fresh-seawater mixing with Na exchange. Saturation of CaCO3 is high before rain 

season, however, all ratios and values are in accordance with the freshwater rainy flush, 

after rain season. A dolomitization process seems to happen also. The water salinity is 

related to a water-rock interaction with agriculture activity’s inputs, and it’s not to exclude a 

deep salty layer influence too. It is very similar to S. Domingos valley.

At Flamengos valley, hydrochemical analyses were taken at four boreholes; FT-62 and SP-

12 near the coastline and near the beginning of the TEM profile, and FBE-145 and FT-5 

further upstream beyond last TEM sounding, (table 7.19a and b). Again, all water samples 

have TDS values above the 0.5 g.L
-1
. Water from FT-62 is MgCl changing to NaCl type, and 

nearby SP-12 the water is of NaCl type, wowing to salty water mixing and also to some 

sewage effluent effects. The inland waters are less mineralized than seashore ones and are 

of NaCl type and enriched with HCO3 due to water-rock interaction process. The seasonal 

flush seems to decrease NaCl content from the possible deep salty layer, by mixing with 

shallow inland freshwater, (figures 7.117 to 7.121).

At S. Miguel valley hydrochemical analyses exist at just one well near the coastline, at the 

beginning of the TEM profile. The water from 52-29 well is of MgCl type, with high salinity 

and Chloride content (table 7.20). It is a mixture of seawater with inland freshwater, and it is 

approximately saturated before the seasonal flush, (figure 7.122 and 7.123).

At all these three valleys, the Tritium content is very low or null and point to older waters 

(residence time of decades) or mixing with present day shallow ones, (Carreira et al., 2010). 

 

 

7.3.7 – Hydrochemical data at Tarrafal and Rib. Grande valley 
 

At Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley, five hydrochemical analysis exists; three boreholes 

and two wells. These later ones are located at Chão Bom (Tarrafal) near the sea. Waters 

from these wells together with the borehole in Chão Bom have high to very high EC and 

salinity values. The two nearby boreholes in Ribeira Grande valley are 1 km from the 

coastline. All the water samples are of NaCl type, and surpass the 0.5 g.L
-1
 TDS limits, (table 

7.21 and 7.22). The groundwater in Chão Bom is a seawater-freshwater mixing with salinity 

decreasing after the rainy season. The seawater amount ranges from 4% at borehole up to 

7.5% at wells. TDS content in Ribeira Grande is smaller because boreholes are less deep, 

inland flow is higher and salinity comes most certainly from a water-rock interaction process. 

Anthropogenic influence seems to be also present, especially at borehole FT-27 as both 

boreholes are nowadays within the village, (figures 7.124 to 7.129). Eastwards of Chão Bom 

the Tritium value in water samples is bellow the 1 T.U., pointing again to high residence 

times (Carreira et al., 2010).

7.3.8 – Resistivity to hydrochemical data relations 
 

The hydrochemical analysis showed that one of the major and the most abundant anion is 

Chloride, which is the reason why waters are of -Cl type. As Cl amount in the local volcanic 

rocks is rather low (Alves et al. 1979), the measured quantities can be seen as a benchmark 

of the groundwater origin and evolution in Santiago’s island, with the advantage of a 

conservative behaviour. The other groundwater ionic elements and compounds are mostly 

from water-rock interaction along the underground path way. The Chloride enrichment 

process over the typical inland NaHCO3 water is happening at valleys downstream; very near 

the ocean by direct fresh-seawater mixing and ion exchange when low head and flow 

hydraulic conditions occur and from deep salty layer influence by leaching and dissolution of 

ancient marine sediments, probably induced by borehole overexploitation, at mid valleys and 

far from the coastline. Nevertheless, the marine aerosol spray cannot be excluded as 

another source of salinity. Soil irrigation with brackish waters also increases the salt content 

at valley shallow depths. 

 

The groundwater salinity can be thus given by Chlorinities, and related to sea distance and 

bulk TEM resistivity. Figure 7.130 shows waters Chloride (TDS percentage) versus sea

distance at the surveyed valleys. A linear trend can be assigned with decreasing Cl 

percentage inland and a shoreline value of 42% (less than pure seawater). The mean data 

samples offset to fit trend line is 6%. 

 

Figure 7.130 – Groundwater’s Cl percentage versus distance to the sea. 

 

   Cl ? ?42 ? 0.006 ? distance? ? 6 %   (7.1) 
 

with distance given in meters. Expression (7.1) is valid within the measured range distance, 

as gives zero Chloride percentage at 7 km from the coastline (and negative beyond that). At 

5.3 km, the Cl is about 10 % of TDS amount. This is the mean measured value detected at 

inland locations. 

 

A fit can be also found to the total Cl per litre amount, with a high increase going towards the 

sea, to around 15 g.L
-1
 at the coastline (under Cl content seawater), figure 7.131, below.

     Cl ? ????????? !"#$,&amp;amp;'  mg.L

   (7.2) 

 

Expression (7.2) will give lesser Cl content very near the sea, when the comparison is done 

against respective sample data. However it has a reasonable fit beyond that distance, within 

the range of distances of the data samples.

These Cl values can be directly compared against the nearby bulk modelled resistivities 

(from TEM sounding), as given at figure 7.132. An inverse relationship is found. With the 

available data, two separate sample groups are noted; the nearest to sea and high Cl 

content (above 1 g.L
-1
, group I) and inland ones (Cl content below that value, group II). The 

former ones are detected by TEM measures within the 1.5 to 3 ohm.m range and the latter 

ones within the 8 to 20 ohm.m range. These values are linked to lithologic environment, 

notably to porosity, which can be assumed with a mean value of 15% all over the studied 

valleys. 

 

Figure 7.132 – Groundwater’s Chloride versus bulk TEM resistivity. 

 

     Cl ? ????()  mg.L

    (7.3) 

 

with a mean 25% error. The ?b is the modelled TEM bulk resistivity value (in ohm.m). 

 

With this calibration factor, and taking into account that no other lithology (whether saturated 

or not), exhibits similar low resistivities as group I, one would expect that the hydrogeological 

interpretation of the TEM sounding data within and even below the above-mentioned 

resistivity range represents a high content of Chloride, and thus a high salinity groundwater. 

Some clay could exhibit similar low resistivities, like Bentonite (formed by weathered volcanic 

ash). Bentonite outcrops were detected at eastern Santiago (João Coroado, personal 

communication) but this clay type is almost Chloride free, and could not be responsible for 

the detected deep low electric resistivities. 

 

With this assumption and taking expression (7.3), the deep low resistivity layer must have at 

least a Chloride equivalent concentration of 2.5 to 5 g per litre, and at least a TDS amount 5 

to 10 g per litre. 

 

Merging the previous expressions, the groundwater quality, given as TDS amount can be 

derived as a function of both TEM resistivities and sea distance:

Bellow, the figure 7.133 displays the TDS content throughout the S. Domingos valley using 

expression (7.4). The values are computed for the shallow groundwater near the sea, the 

seawater intrusion beneath it and for groundwater inland. As detected, seashore 

groundwater salinity is higher, both superficially and at depth, with seawater mixing from 5 to 

12% (TDS from 3000 to 6000 mg.L
-1
). At inland this salinity is lower with a mean of 650 mg.L

-

1
, somewhat less than the measured samples (but within the error), as it comes from a mean 

fit expression for all (fewer) calibration samples. 

Figure 7.133 – Computed groundwater mean TDS at S. Domingos valley. 

 

The same procedure was applied to the remaining surveyed valleys. At Seca and Picos 

valleys, the expected behaviour of near sea shallow influence results in high TDS content (as 

direct EC measures have shown) with values in the 1,5 to 5 g.L
-1
 range (seawater mixing 

from 4 to 14%). Inland values are smaller, from 400 to 1000 mg.L
-1
, figure 7.134. 

Figure 7.134 – Computed groundwater mean TDS at Seca and Picos valleys. 

 

A “discontinuity TDS step” seems to exist at both S. Domingos and Picos valleys, after the 

initial decreasing values. This can be related to changing lithology (less thick Quaternary 

alluvium) and also to overexploitation and inducing a vertical flow of the high conductive 

deep layer, beyond these distances.

At Salto, Flamengos and S. Miguel, computed TDS values are all about 1000 mg.L
-1
. Inland 

higher values could be related to lithologic variations, and to the boreholes influence. Near 

the sea, TDS values are higher too, figure 7.135.

The TDS content map for Tarrafal and Ribeira Grande valley is given below, in figure 7.136. 

The values are for 30 m below mean sea level. The NE-SW feature between Chão Bom and 

Ribeira Grande (already shown before, at figure 7.102), is now contoured with high TDS 

values. These TDS values are all above 2 g.L
-1
 at Ribeira Grande valley. That’s also true for 

Chão Bom, except at a small area in the plateaux’s middle, with smaller values. The NE-SW 

feature could be related with some fault/fracture and/or ancient valley filled with salty 

material.

7.4 – Simplified SUTRA models 
 

To understand these TDS values, hydrodynamic numerical simulation has been done with 

the well-known and tested U.S. Geological Survey’s SUTRA code. SUTRA (Saturated-

Unsaturated TRAnsport) is a finite-element 3D code to solve a very general set of single-

phase subsurface fluid flow and single-species transport problems, (Voss, 1984). The history 

and implementation of SUTRA code, as also a review of major published SUTRA 

applications is given in Voss (1999). 

 

The code solves numerically two general balance equations: for variable-density single-

phase saturated-unsaturated flow and for single-species solute (or energy) transport, based 

upon Bear (1979) formulations. First equation, for seawater intrusion (i.e. variable density 

saturated flow with non-reactive solute transport of TDS or Chloride) is the general fluid mass 

balance equation (usually referred as the groundwater flow model), given by:

where ? is the fluid density, /01 is the specific pressure storativity, ? the fractional porosity, p 
is the fluid pressure, U can be either solute mass fraction (C) or temperature (T), k is the 

permeability tensor, µ is the fluid viscosity, g is the gravity vector and Qp is the fluid mass 

source (all in the International System units). The fluid density is expressed as:

The second equation is given with unified solute mass and energy balances, usually referred 

as the transport model, simplified for seawater intrusion conditions as:

where DULkl and DULQi are the longitudinal dispersivities for flow in the maximum and 
minimum permeability directions, respectively. The DWLkl and DWLQi are the transverse 
dispersivities for flow in the maximum and minimum permeability directions, respectively. The 

mno is the angle between the maximum permeability direction to the local flow direction. 
These definitions allow the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities to vary in a time-

dependent manner at any point depending on the flow’s direction. Usually, longitudinal 

dispersivity is about one hundred times more intense at horizontal than by vertical direction. 

Transverse dispersivity is usually held constant, i.e. independent of flow direction, (Voss, 

1999). 

 

A simplified 3D model for the axial mid valley is tested with the known hydraulic parameter 

values to check the validity of the hypothesis of the deep conductive layer to behave as a 

salinity groundwater source, other than inland water-rock interaction. The near ocean shallow 

fresh to seawater mixing was also tested, upon the conditions detected by TEM soundings. 

 

For the SUTRA simulation of the first situation, a uniform rectangular model with a 2000 m 

long (x-direction), 400 m wide (y-direction) and 70 to 50 m depth (z-direction), with the 

constant bottom at 50 m below msl was tested. A tridimensional mesh dimension was set 

with 160×20×40 finite element (rectangular elements). Applied hydraulic parameters are 

presented at table 7.23. Most of them are unknown to actual problem and thus initially taken 

from published similar cases, as the Hawaii Oahu island basaltic aquifer (Voss, 1999). A 

range values to the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities have been tested. From 100 to 

1000 for the longitudinal dispersivity. From 0 to 10 for the transverse dispersivity. 

 

The final and chosen values, that are compatible with observed and measured data, are 

given at table 7.23.

Boundary conditions were set to the inland and ocean sides, as also to the surface and 

bottom ones. Lateral wedge boundaries are closed to fluid flow. A flux was set from inland 

side, corresponding to calculated infiltration rates. At the seaward boundary, the usual 

hydrostatic seawater pressure is held together with seawater concentration. Top surface 

recharge is also included with known values. At the bottom wedge, upward flow represents 

the main inland regional discharge with seawater concentration’s equivalent, from the high 

EC salty layer effect. All these values are constant over time, and an equilibrium condition 

(steady-state) was sought with the given hydraulic parameters, outputting a concentration 

spatial distribution field. 

 

The model spatial discretization must be set in order to avoid general oscillations in the 

concentration distribution, with finite-element size limitation. This is related to the mesh 

Peclet number criterion (Voss. 1984): 

 

     PeL ?
|F|?U\

?r]h[\|F|?
    (7.13a) 

 

where ?sU is the local distance between element sides along a streamline of flow. Stability is 
guaranteed in all cases when PeL t 2. This criterion significantly affects discretization. 
Spatial stability is usually obtained with SUTRA when PeL t 4 , which gives a less-stringent 
criterion. In the case of solute transport with longitudinal dispersion primarily due to 

longitudinal mixing, the mesh Peclet number becomes: 

 

     PeL u
?U\
[\

     (7.13b) 

 

Conditions are then defined by ?sU t 4DU and ?sU v 10DW (Voss and Provost, 2003). 
 

Taking this into account and the boundary conditions, summarized in table 7.24 for two 

scenarios (higher and lower inland and surface recharge flow) the TDS (salinity) 

concentration field was computed via SUTRA. The higher to low flux is regarded as the 

seasonal rainy effect at shallow depth. Results for the two described scenarios are shown at 

figure 7.137. Variations can be noted when seasonal inland shallow flow decreases and the

deep upwards flow stays constant over time (trough salty layer). The deep layer influence is 

high at “dry season” and with increasing borehole pumping or overexploitation, salinity values 

will easily reach the mean observed 1000 mg.L
-1
 value. To confirm the effect of a borehole 

overexploitation, a SUTRA simulation was also done with the borehole in the centre of the 

model and depth position of 30 m below msl. The water sink amount was set to 1.5 kg.s

valley; at a) “dry season” and b) “rain season” scenarios. 

 

The simulated results in figure 7.138 show that major TDS values increase near the 

borehole, with an “upconning” asymmetry and offset into the ocean direction. That’s because 

borehole sink breaks and disturbs local equilibrium between the downstream horizontal and 

bottom upper vertical flux, with this latter overwhelming beyond this position (some small 

numerical instability is also superimposed). This same kind of signature seems to be present 

in TEM resistivity cross sections at S. Domingos valley, near boreholes FT-26 and FT-38 (fig. 

7.15), and borehole FT-6 in Seca valley (fig.7.29), and could be the explanation of those 

geometric features. 

 

Under these conditions, TDS asset value in the borehole is about 1500 mg.L
-1
. This amount 

will change upon borehole sink rate and also with the prevailing local hydraulic parameters.

Thus, the reasonable explanation to measured groundwater TDS and Chloride content (as 

well the conductive TEM values) can indeed be the deep enriched salty layer. 

Overexploitation just induces and increases the water's salinity amount. Far from the 

coastline, by the prevailing dynamic conditions, it’s impossible for the modern seawater to be 

the salinity main source. 

 

Figure 7.138 – Borehole overexploitation effect at mid valley. Cross section perspective view of 3D 

SUTRA simulated TDS groundwater’s values, (colour scale is the same of fig. 7.137). 

 

For the SUTRA second simulation, a uniform rectangular sheet like model with a 1600 m 

long (x-direction), 400 m wide (y-direction) and 37 to 35 m depth (z-direction), with the 

constant bottom at 35 m below msl was tested. The tridimensional mesh dimension was set 

with 60×10×40 finite element (rectangular elements). The tested and applied hydraulic 

parameters are presented at table 7.25, for the two zone layers. The remaining system 

parameter values are the same as the previous ones. The output TDS groundwater 

concentrations are much independent on the porosity values at this dispersive environment 

model. Under this scenario, with no groundwater withdrawal, the mixing waters reach a 

concentration state as shown at figure 7.139, with a 4 to 5 g.L
-1
 near the coastline and a null 

effect beyond 1300 m. These values are similar and compatible with the observed TDS at 

wells near the shoreline. This equilibrium condition ends up independent of initial 

concentration (when filled with fresh or seawater).

Vertical scale is 6 times the horizontal scale. 

 

Standing on this result, the measured groundwater TDS values near the shoreline are due to 

a direct mixing between subsurface meteoric water and seawater. This is possible and 

provided by the particular geologic settings and groundwater level variations throughout the 

hydrological year; raising and flushing this underground area (diminish the TDS amount) or 

dropping and allowing the seawater advance inland (augmenting the TDS amount).

TEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME 

 

In this eighth chapter, the observed changes in TEM data acquired at different times are 

discussed within climatologic and hydrochemistry settings. 

 

 

8.1 – TEM sounding repetitions 
 

At some selected surveyed places, repetitions of several soundings were done within the 

available fieldwork time and local prevailed conditions. Most of the TEM soundings within the 

repetition’s framework were acquired exactly at the same initial position. Geographic 

coordinates of the soundings were taken by a GPS hand unit, under the WGS84 geodetic 

Datum (or converted to) with a horizontal assigned error of about 10 m. After, sometimes the 

return to the exact site was impossible due to changes on lands motivated by agricultural 

works. On this occasion, the sounding’s position offset from original position was small, one 

loop size distance at most. Some repetitions, when possible, were also acquired with a larger 

50 m × 50 m single loop size. The TEM-FAST 48 time mode acquisition was not always the 

same, and that was chosen regarding the observed data quality and available signal power. 

Quality of the data soundings and curve points scattering are unequal. The high available 

power at the last survey’s fieldwork does not mean better results. The summary of the 

available soundings repetitions have been summarized in table 7.1 of previous chapter. 

 

 

8.1.1 – 2005-2009 S. Domingos valley TEM data 
 

At S. Domingos valley (near Achada Baleia village), the chosen minimum number of sites 

(TEM soundings) that have been repeated was four, wrapping extremes and middle valley 

locations. They were the TEM soundings; AB02, AB12, AB26 and AB33. In 2006 fieldworks 

only two sites were easily accessible (AB02 and AB12) since the valley road was flooded at 

the time. In 2008 and 2009 TEM soundings were repeated for 10 sites. 

 

Apparent resistivity curves and 1D mean models of each sounding are shown in figures 8.1 

and 8,2, next page. Model misfit errors are about 5 to 7%. The measured apparent 

resistivity’s changes between epochs are due to real changes in the subsurface, but loop 

location offset cannot be ruled out, especially at AB02 sounding’s site. 

 

The comparison of the 1D models from AB02, AB12 and AB26 sites, shows that the top 

layers’ characteristics are roughly the same (as expected). The conductive layer underneath 

the shallow one, representing a seawater-groundwater mixing zone (at AB02 and AB12 

sites), has a change in the resistivity that is compatible with the effect of the measured 

annual precipitation in those epochs, as seen in figure 8.3. The assumption that high rainfall 

and infiltration decrease the seawater effect at these near sea sites, increasing the shallow 

groundwater resistivity values seems to be confirmed.

Figure 8.3 – Annual mean precipitation at Santiago’s Island (2004-2008) 

and EM fieldwork epochs (2005-2009). (INMG). 

 

The resistivity of this shallow groundwater should be proportional to rain amount (R) and 

inversely proportional to spanned time (?T) after the rainy season. Comparison is done 

against annual precipitation registered at S. Jorge dos Orgãos meteorological station, at 

middle Island, affecting S. Domingos hydropraphic basin (INMG data). For the given time 

span, the two data sets show an increasing trend with a 0.010 ± 0.001 ?.m.mm
-1
 for the 

AB02 and AB12 soundings. This is a mean value, since figure 8.4 suggests that a 1 to 2 

years time lag can exist between the two data sets, with the resistivity response delay 

implying a flow velocity in the shallow groundwater of about 20 m.day
-1
 throughout the valley.

well constrained by TEM data AB02 models, by less accurate data curves. It is much more

limited at soundings AB12 and AB26, within 7 to 14 and 10 to 14 ?.m, respectively. A 

“reverse pattern” and “trend” is detected at these three TEM soundings (AB02, AB12 and 

AB26). The trend shows that the low resistivity values seem to follow the rainiest seasons 

and that more water should be interacting or dissolving more salts becaming more 

conductive. The deep conductive layer was not always clearly detected, and that is a function 

of data quality. At AB02 and AB12 layer depth is compatible with fresh-seawater interface 

position. At sounding AB26 the conductive layer is located at 50 to 60 m below msl. The TEM 

sounding AB33 exhibits a high scatter at shallow layer depth positions and also at deep 

conductive layer depth position. The most probable explanation is that the very nearby 

unattended borehole FT26 was extracting groundwater during sounding’s acquisition, and 

disturbing the free water level and the deep mixing interface. The bulk resistivity ranges from 

12 to 20 ?.m. 

 

These resistivity values are converted to groundwater salinity (TDS) using equation (7.4) and 

presented in figure 8.5. It’s notorious that, although some seasonal variations, computed salt 

content stays between 410 and 725 mg.L
-1
 in inland locations, while it changes to higher 

values, 1700 to 4800 mg.L
-1
, at shallow depths near the sea. In between these, at transition 

zone, the deep groundwater shows a salinity increase trend. As observed in the previous 

sub-chapter 7.3.8, these inland computed values are underestimated and can have an error 

of 25-30%. Knowing this and the groundwater chemistry (NaCl type) at valley, this can be 

translated to a groundwater Chloride content of between 200 and 350 mg.L
-1
 and also 

equivalent contemporary seawater mixing of 1 to 2%. 

 

Figure 8.5 – Computed groundwater TDS amounts (2005-2009), at S. Domingos valley. 

 

 

8.1.2 – 2005-2009 Seca and Picos valleys TEM data 
 

At Seca valley, the number of repeated TEM soundings at exactly the same sites were two; 

sounding SECA16 near the sea and sounding SECA21 at shallow seawater influence 

transition zone. Also between these sounding’s locations, two more extra soundings were 

done and repeated during the two last survey epochs (SECA17A and 18A). At Picos valley 

there were three repeated sites; sounding PICOS04, PICOS10 and PICOS12, at mid valley, 

with the last two ones not covering all survey period.  



TEM DATA CHANGES OVER TIME  
______________________________ 

 267

Data curves and 1D models for each of those soundings are presented in figures 8.6 and 

8.7, for Seca valley and in figures 8.9 and 8,10 for Picos valley. In the year 2008 the TEM 

soundings SECA16 and 21 were acquired with 50 m × 50 m loop. Mean model misfit errors 

are about 6 and 7% for Seca and Picos soundings, respectively. 

 

The near to sea SECA16 sounding models exhibit greater variability, notoriously that one 

repeated in 2008 (an incorrect site location is a possible cause). The shallow groundwater 

resistivity layer varies from 2 to 6-8 ?.m, and groundwater mixing seems to be rather 

independent of time, probably from greater well water exploitation, reducing the natural 

outflow to the sea. Underneath this, basaltic aquifer layer resistivity ranges from 2 to 10 ?.m, 

and the deep conductive layer is detected at roughly 50 m below msl. The models for 

soundings SECA21, SECA17A and 18A are much more invariant over time with shallow 

groundwater layer resistivity from 4 to 6 ?.m. The basaltic aquifer layer bellow is less 

resistive with values from 2 to 3 ?.m. The deep conductive layer can be detected at the best 

sounding data curves, with resistivity values under 1 ?.m, but not well constrained. 

 

Figure 8.6 – Apparent resistivity TEM sounding curves at Seca valley (SECA16, 17A, 18A and 21). 

 

As before, a comparison against the precipitation at S. Jorge dos Orgãos meteorological 

station, located at Seca hydropraphic basin head, was done. Variation in resistivity has a less 

expressive slope at SECA16 site, with an increasing trend of just 0.002 ?.m.mm
-1
 and a 

decreasing 0.010 ?.m.mm
-1
 trend at SECA21 site, figure 8.8. This behaviour is explained by 

the fact that groundwater extraction is more significant at those places, especially near 

SECA21 location.

At Picos valley the nearest to sea soundings (PICOS10 and PICOS12) exhibit again a 

shallow low resistivity layer with values ranging from 1 to 3 ?.m, followed by a more resistive 

basaltic aquifer layer with values from 3 to 6 ?.m. At mid of the TEM profile (PICOS04 

sounding) the superficial basaltic aquifer layer shows resistivity values from 11 to 13 ?.m, 

followed by lower resistive values 2 to 5 ?.m. Insights to deep conductive layer, beyond 50 m 

below msl, is given at some soundings.

Results of the calculated bulk resistivity values to groundwater salinity (TDS) conversion are 

shown in figure 8.10 and 8.11, for Seca and Picos valleys, respectively. Almost all these 

computed values are high above the 1000 mg.L
-1
. At both valleys, the shallow groundwater 

TDS content decreases inland, in accordance with direct measure’s indications. Underneath 

this, at Seca valley deep waters are even more salty to inland, over this distance range. At 

Picos valley, the behaviour is similar with deeper groundwater becoming also more salty to 

inland. 

 

At Picos valley computed TDS values (from bulk resistivity) at shallow groundwater exhibit 

high scatter than values from Seca valley, with no conclusive TDS trend in time. To this NaCl 

water type, the highest TDS values correspond to a mean Chloride content of 500 and 800 

mg.L
-1
, respectively, for Seca and Picos shallow groundwaters, and slightly higher at greater 

depths, near the coastline. This corresponds to equivalent (contemporary) seawater mixing 

of 2.5 and 4% at shallow waters, respectively for Seca and Picos. Beyond this sea distance, 

TDS values are known to diminish, in accordance with the remaining TEM soundings and 

direct measures (subchapter 7.3.8).

8.1.3 – 2006-2009 Salto, Flamengos and S.Miguel valleys TEM data 
 

At Salto valley, four TEM soundings have been repeated at the same site: soundings 

SALTO03, SALTO04, SALTO06 and SALTO07, in the years 2008 and 2009. At Flamengos 

valley, three soundings (FL02, FL05 and FL06), were repeated since 2007. For S. Miguel 

valley, three soundings (SM01, SM04 and SM08) were repeated at each year subsequent to 

initial survey (2007). 

 

Apparent resistivity curves and 1D models for each of those soundings are shown in figures 

8.12 to 8.15. The mean misfit errors range from 5 to 10%, for TEM acquired at Salto, and are 

about the same order for Flamengos and S.Miguel. Soundings from 2008 are observed to be 

noisier, with higher scatter in the late time points. 

 

The SALTO03 and SALTO04 soundings were always done at exactly the same site. The 

other two soundings, SALTO06 and SALTO07, due to landscape conditions and lack of 

useful landmarks, were repeated as close as possible to the original ascribed coordinates. 

These latter soundings show a greater variability that can be, to some extent, committed to 

that offset, revealing local 2D or 3D geometry effects, figures 8.12 to 8.13. At Flamengos 

these behaviours were not observed, with rather smooth and similar soundings, figure 8.14. 

The same sounding localization difficulties were present at S.Miguel TEM sounding SM08. 

 

In Salto, the soundings nearest to the sea (SALTO03 and SALTO04) show almost no 

change, with shallow groundwater resistivity layer staying between 3 and 4 ?.m. At roughly 

40 m below msl, the resistivity increases to about 7 ?.m. This latter value is better 

constrained at SALTO03 sounding. The other two repeated soundings are much more 

problematic; at SALTO06 the resistivity of the basaltic aquifer layer varies between 6 and 17 

?.m and at SALTO07 is even higher, between 14 and 36 ?.m. In both these soundings the 

resistivity decreases with depth to low values, not well constrained by models, but below the 

7 ?.m. 

 

Soundings in Flamengos are much alike, with shallow groundwater resistivity staying 

between 3 and 4 ?.m (FL02), 6 to 9 ?.m (FL05) and about 8 ?.m (FL06). Both, first survey 

and repetitions have been taken just after the rain season, with 2006 season being rainiest 

than 2007 one (resistivities for 2006 are accordingly higher). Deeper at about 50 m bellow 

msl, the resistivity also decreases to low values, bellow 3 ?.m. 

 

At S. Miguel valley, the SM01 and SM04 soundings and models are much alike with major 

differences in deeper layers, arising from the scatter in the data, figure 8.15. The shallow 

groundwater resistivity values are estimated between 7 and 10 ?.m, and the basaltic aquifer 

resistivity is about 3 ?.m. A deep conductive layer is detected at about 50 m bellow msl, with 

resistivity values between 0.5 to 4 ?.m, 

 

The superficial unsaturated layers at these valleys are always much more resistive than any 

other observed layer and had stayed in a practically unchanged trough the time.

From these bulk resistivity values, the groundwater salinity (TDS) conversion gives the 

results, shown in figure 8.16 to 8.18, respectively for Salto, Flamengos and S.Miguel valleys. 

At Salto, salinity decrease inland with values staying more or less constant over time (2000 

to 600 mg.L
-1
). The inland samples show a decreasing trend. From the groundwater type and 

chemical composition, these values are translated to a mean Chloride content of 1000 to 300 

mg.L
-1
, (with the greater values closest to shoreline) or to a equivalent contemporary 

seawater mixing from 5 to 1.5%.

At Flamengos valley, the same trend is observed, with TDS decreasing inland, between 2000 

and 1000 mg.L
-1
, and being higher in the repeated soundings of 2007. This stands in 

agreement to a greater infiltration and water flush in year 2006. These salinity values are 

translated to a mean Chloride content ranging from 800 to 400 mg.L
-1
, with higher values 

being found nearest to the coastline. This corresponds to an equivalent contemporary 

seawater mixing of 4 to 2%. The deepest detected conductive layer, assuming the same kind 

of aquifer behaviour, must have salinity greater than 3 g.L

 and Chloride content greater 

than 1.2 g.L

 and equivalent contemporary seawater mixing of at least 6%.

At S.Miguel valley, the inland decreasing TDS tendency is also present. Salinity values are

8.1.4 – 2005-2009 Tarrafal TEM data 
 

At Tarrafal (Chão Bom plateaux), the number of TEM soundings that were repeated varies 

between 3 and 5. All have been taken along a profile line at Chão Bom north side, over 

TAR02 to TAR06 initial sounding’s direction, each year after 2005 (to the exception of 2008) 

as plotted at figure 8.19.  

 

The mean 1D model was obtained for each TEM sounding, shown in figure 8.20. The 

corresponding resistivity cross section, done by stitching the models, is shown in figure 8.21. 

The figure includes all the four-year profiles with their relative position to each other, all with 

the same resistivity colour scale. The model’s responses to data curve’s misfit are about 4 to 

8%. 

 

Figure 8.19 – Location of original (2005) and repetition soundings 

at northwest Tarrafal (Chão Bom), (2006-2009). 

 

As expected, the overall layer’s geometry seems to be mostly unchanged, but some real 

resistivity variations are detected trough the time (that couldn’t be ascribed to models’ 

equivalence or error misfit). The major changes take place at the deepest layer, with higher 

resistivity values in 2006 and 2009 years, figure 8.22. Those changes mean that TDS values 

at depth 30 m below msl oscillated between about 3000 to 1500 mg.L

, or 1 to 0.5 g.L

Chloride content, respectively.

from 2005 to 2009. 

 

Although the measured resistivity variations seem to be directly correlated with the registered 

precipitation amounts (figure 8.3), the groundwater mixing with this rainwater infiltration flush 

would turn out into higher resistivity values in the inland side, gradually decreasing resistivity 

towards the sea. That is partially verified at shallow layers but not completely fulfilled at all 

profile’s length and depth. One hypothesis to explain this behaviour is the already mentioned 

mechanism of mixing of groundwater with upcoming flux from the deep salty enrichment 

older waters, as no disturbance by groundwater exploitation is done at or near these TEM 

sounding. 

 

A two to one water mixing ratio, with the higher value being from the deep conductive layer, 

and the smaller from the shallow layer, is sufficient to justify the observed variations, 

assuming that deep layer has the suggested present day equivalent seawater salinity. An 

even smaller mixing ratio will be verified if the deep layer is under brine like condition. 

 

At groundwater depths, where borehole screens are usually installed, it is expected that the 

TDS observed changes aren’t directly linked to recent rainfall events.

8.2 – TEM versus Rainfall correlation 
 

The relation between the registered precipitation and the time measured bulk electric 

resistivity changes to the groundwater layers (water’s TDS) are seen to be of different origin, 

in respect to near sea shallow groundwater and to deep groundwater. 

 

In S. Domingos, Seca and Picos valleys, the near coastline shallow groundwaters quality (i.e. 

salinity or TDS content) are directly related to the correspondent rainfall quantities in the 

respective hydrographic basin. This is controlled by local confining or semi-confining layers 

that allow the seawater to encroach into inland and mix with freshwater when the 

groundwater table is below the upper confining layer limit. That can happen by; groundwater 

overexploitation, natural system discharges depression long after the rainy season or under 

a prevailing wet condition. The relation between rainfall and bulk resistivity of the shallow 

layer is of the order of 0.010 ?.m.mm
-1
. 

 

The bulk resistivity variations in the basaltic aquifer are due to the groundwater resistivity. 

This groundwater is a mixing from the sub-superficial inland waters, already changed by rock 

interaction, and deep upward flow of waters with high dissolved salt’s content. The measured 

groundwater EC value depends on its ionic content, and that can be changed by the mixing 

of different inland waters. The time changes come only from the time changes on the 

recharge rates, and that can be difficult to track when mixing occurs, as isotopic measures 

showed. Nevertheless, those resistivity time changes can be compared against the available 

precipitation time series, back to the early 60 of last century, figure 8.23. The simple Pearson 

correlation coefficient between the short resistivity time sets and the wider rainfall ones was 

done for the several soundings’ repetitions. For some valleys, the correlation was poor and 

no apparent relations between the two data sets were found. “Conclusive results” come from 

the S. Domingos valley, were the four soundings spanning the 2005-2009 period. The results 

seem to indicate a spatial flow evolution where a strong negative Pearson coefficient is 

detected (-0.90 to -0.98 range).

The negative correlation means, as expected, that a rainfall increase implies a bulk resistivity 

decreasing, or a TDS increasing. The observed correlation holds like described in table 8.1, 

with the corresponding year and time delay getting higher as distance to hydrographic head 

basin increases. The travel mean time for this deep upstream flow influence is of about 30 

years, which is a similar and compatible result to the ascribed values in chapter 6. A piston 

like mechanism seems to be present between the inland central mountains’ recharge, and 

the near sea discharges.

From this computed delay time, and for the implicated distances (groundwaters path), with a 

minimum length of 15 km and a possible maximum of about 20 km, an average linear 

velocity of 1.5 ± 0.3 m.d

 are estimated. Applying the Darcy law with a hydraulic gradient of 

0.04, results into hydraulic conductivity (for the several porosities values), given at table 8.2.

Assuming that deep groundwater path way goes through the middle and more compact 

bottom geologic units, with smaller porosities, the corresponding regional hydraulic 

conductivity must be in the 4 ± 2 m.d
-1
 range. These values agree and are of the same order 

of those ones previously computed (in subchapter 7.2.5) from the field data. The same order 

of delay time is obtained at SECA21 TEM sounding, with a Pearson coefficient of -0.90 for a 

lag of 29 years, and a hydraulic conductivity of 3.5 m.d
-1
. 

 

For Salto valley the bulk resistivity variations, under the strong influence of the central island 

Assomada region, the correlation between data sets give a wider time lag ranging from 29 to 

40 years, figure 8.24.

The Table 8.3 summarizes the computed correlation values. From these delay times and for 

the concerned groundwater path distances, with a minimum length of 12 km and a possible

 are calculated. 

Applying again the Darcy law with a hydraulic gradient of 0.04 (and various porosities) results 

in hydraulic conductivity as given in table 8.4. The mean regional hydraulic conductivity in the

Although these hydraulic conductivity values and estimated time lags are similar to observed 

and expected ones, all these values have to be taken and regarded with care, as the TEM

CONCLUSIONS 

 

On this night chapter, the conclusions about the work are described, with some 

recommendations and future work’s applications. 

 

 

9.1 – Concluding remarks and outlook 
 

The application of the EM transient method as an evaluation tool of groundwater quality, if 

properly calibrated against known information from the wells and boreholes (namely the 

chemical water composition), proved to be feasible to the semi-arid Cape Verde 

environmental condition. That is especially important for areas where the watershed points 

are sparse. 

 

To this purposes the TEM data spatial density is higher than local watersheds, giving 

altogether information about deep layers, beyond the depth of the existent boreholes. At 

Santiago Island, the present study showed that groundwater quality in coastline valleys, 

regarding to salinity, has two distinct origins. 

 

From the available data and their analysis, the conclusion is that groundwater quality, i.e. its 

TDS content (furthermore its usefulness), apart from rock interaction enrichment, is naturally 

affected by the rainfall amount at each hydrographic basin. 

 

In Santiago, the shallow seashore aquifer system, especially in the south-eastern coastline 

valleys, are under direct influence of seawater and attains a strong seasonal salinity variation 

effect. This effect is a consequence of valley’s lithological geometry, with local impervious to 

semi-pervious layers allowing the seawater shallow mixing, as simulation had shown. The 

problem increases by the groundwater overexploitation at the annual dry period or under 

long time waterless condition, when groundwater salinity is high. Land irrigation from these 

wells and shallow boreholes, enhances even further the soil and water salinity. This 

procedure has changed the soil in these fertile valleys, into unproductive or low productive 

ones. The solution to decrease land salty content is to start irrigation with less salty inland 

sources, like from springs, boreholes, water dam reservoir or desalinized waters. Another 

solution, already tested with success at a small scale in the valleys between Picos and Salto, 

is to insert a deep concrete wall, side to side near the end of the valley to stop the seawater 

encroachment and its mixing with fresh or brackish water (António Pina, personal 

communication). 

 

Concerning the deep groundwater, available in boreholes, its extraction usually starts 1 km 

from the coastline, onward. The TEM survey data have shown in most valleys a conductive 

layer below mean sea level (at roughly 50 m depth). These low resistivity values can be 

associated to seawater salt’s deposition (evaporites) in the course of ancient low level 

seawater episodes. This deep layer can be also the source to the higher Chloride water 

content. The shallow direct infiltration of recent meteoric waters and the deeper and older

ones with larger-scale time and path way from central mountain regions, mix in the valleys 

ends. The mixing is certainly not constant because both groundwater flows (deep and 

shallow) must be changing with precipitation recharge rates over the years. The data seems 

compatible with a deep groundwater flow of about 30 years long (although care must be 

taken regarding the analyses from the few TEM variability data set). This mixing can be also 

induced by the overexploitation conditions in boreholes, increasing the water salt content 

from upward flow across salty layers, as the numerical flow simulations showed. There is no 

direct and easy solution to this problem. The action is to impose a groundwater extraction 

limit at each borehole in these valleys, compatible with a given allowed TDS maximum value. 

Each borehole groundwater extraction rate should change throughout seasons and also from 

year to year. Monitoring the groundwater EC periodically could easily give the desired 

information to assign that extraction rate limit. However, the observed and actual reality, is 

that the local authorities have been unsuccessful, applying to boreholes and wells a number 

of hours per day extraction limits. 

 

For irrigation purposes, the present groundwater chemical characterization is adequate. It 

could help to delineate, altogether with soil classification, the agricultural specimens to 

achieve the best yields with the available water quality. The condition is that present yields 

are progressively decreasing for traditional plants because the water and soil salinity within 

valleys is increasing. 

 

But available groundwater chemical data is insufficient to search out finer details about 

shallow and deeper waters. The mixing conditions on borehole water sampling surely had 

affected the joint TEM and hydrochemistry interpretation, superimposing a higher scatter on 

the data. In the present conditions, most of the boreholes have multi screens placed at 

several depths producing a groundwater extra mixing. Taking this into account, care must be 

also taken with future chemical water sampling. If possible, the use of water grab samplers in 

the boreholes from several depths is preferable. Borehole continuous water EC logging 

profiles would also be very useful to help interpretation. Furthermore, an accurate 

topographic levelling with centimetres precision of the watersheds (wells and boreholes) is 

desired, to achieve a better knowledge about groundwater levels. This could be a task to 

carry out after the responsible authority’s conclusion of the Santiago Island watersheds’ 

catalogue. 

 

Concerning a possible future electromagnetic field work, a higher spatial density and a 

powerful transient equipment is recommendable. That will overcome the (present work) weak 

input signal and enhance the SNR, reaching easily to greater depths. Water sampling for 

chemical analyses, but especially water parameters (like EC, pH and temperature), as also 

water depth measures should be carried out altogether with upcoming TEM survey. The 

sounding’s inversion and modelling will profit from this and also with continuous profiling, 

collated or very nearby soundings, to better fulfil the needs of the 2D and 3D interpretation 

methods, tested in this work. 

 

The applied algorithm, for the quasi-2D and quasi-3D inversion, proved to be useful, with 

some intrinsic and natural limitations. The 2D approximation being a LCI method was only 

applied to those surveyed valleys where the TEM soundings were acquired in succession

along an almost constant direction. Those 2D starting models were always resistive uniform 

with fixed thickness layers. The 2D inversion results gave similar structures and resistivity 

values when compared against the simple collated 1D inversion tool from native equipment 

software, which gives confidence to the inversion outputs. In general, the global fit between 

model result’s output and field data gets better with growing lateral distance influence. That 

inclusion of more nearby sounding’s data follows the expected behaviour, with smaller rms 

misfit values at the expense of slightly smoothing each sounding model. Beyond the imposed 

number of fixed layer’s geometry, the distance between soundings (spatial soundings 

density) is a more relevant issue. When neighbours soundings are further apart, naturally are 

not to expect a really true continuity influence, hence the blocky output observed in some 

model’s parts. 

 

The 3D approximation being a SCI method was consequently applied only to the surveyed 

wide areas of S. Domingos and Tarrafal plateaux. The kind of performance from the 

inversion algorithm is similar to the 2D approximation. The misfit rms tends to be smaller with 

more soundings inclusion to the inversion, unless the medium owns a more heterogeneous 

structure, like from the Tarrafal area. 

 

From these achieved electric resistivity values, relations between this data and the available 

hydrological and groundwater chemical data were found. Those relations are satisfactory and 

hold relatively well, concerning the present amount of data. Relations like the TDS inland 

distributions are based upon the deducted porosity, around 15 to 20 %, to both sedimentary 

shallow layers and altered and fractured basalts. Upon this and from measured electric 

resistivity values, acquired by electromagnetic (or DC) methods, TDS values and 

groundwater quality can be deduced. 

 

With nowadays data, the exact Santiago Island hydrologic water balance is difficult to reach. 

Only the bound’s value can be estimated. Nevertheless, it seems that the major problem that 

Santiago is faced with, does not concern only to the water available quantity, but as more to 

do with the available quality, especially at the agricultural land irrigation areas.
