ABSTRACT 

 

PINTO, V. M. Simulation of water and nitrogen dynamics in a Cerrado soil under coffee 

cultivation using SWAP and ANIMO models. 2015. 123 p. Tese (Doutorado) – Centro de 

Energia Nuclear na Agricultura, Universidade de São Paulo, Piracicaba, 2015. 

 

Agriculture when only focused on production leads to an unsustainable use of inputs with 

negative consequences to the environment and human health. One consequence of the 

excessive use of fertilizers is the pollution of surface and underground water resources in 

agricultural eco-systems and their boundaries. The Brazilian Cerrado has been suffering the 

transformations of the intensive agriculture during the last decades. Due to the poor fertility of 

soils, in general very sandy and of low pH, the use of agricultural inputs is intensified and the 

nutrient downward transport by leaching becomes a serious problem in different regions. 

Information about the current use practices of fertilizer use in the Cerrado environment must 

be gathered for a healthy transition of this biome. Models based on physical and chemical 

processes are useful tools to simulate water and nutrient dynamics in agricultural systems, 

including the related losses due to adopted managements. They have the potential to evaluate 

different scenarios to predict outcomings of such practices.  Among the available models for 

such processes, SWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant model) has been used under 

several agronomic conditions to describe hydrologic processes, and ANIMO (Nitrogen in 

Agriculture model) to simulate N cycling in agricultural systems. Our study presents an 

application of SWAP to adult perennial coffee crops along one productive cycle, with focus 

on deep drainage losses and irrigation management in a representative Brazilian Cerrado 

management system. The SWAP/ANIMO combination was used in this study to simulate N 

absorption by coffee plants and N leaching in the form NO3-N, as a result of an intensive 

fertilizer management practice. The ANIMO program was calibrated in relation to one N 

treatment, of 400 kg ha
-1

 year
-1

, and was evaluated with independent data of NO3-N in soil 

solution of another treatment of 800 kg ha
-1

 year
-1

. The yearly water balance (WB) obtained 

from SWAP was similar to that obtained through a sequential climatologic WB of 

Thornthwaite and Matter. However, the monthly deep drainage values obtained by SWAP as 

compared to the WB values presented differences with a determination coefficient of 0.77 in a 

linearization of the results. Irrigation scenarios with intervals of 3(IF3), 5(IF5), 10 (IF10) e 15 

(IF15) days between water applications were simulated by SWAP and compared with the 

irrigation management practiced in the farm where the experiment was carried out. These 

simulations showed for longer intervals (IF15) drainage losses were smaller, water 

productivity higher, as well as relative productivity.  Measurements of N absorption by plants 

obtained experimentally were similar to ANIMO simulations. Sensitivity analyses of the 

model showed that leaching and soil solution concentration of NO3-N are sensitive to soil pH 

and temperature of the decomposition processes. We conclude that the combination of SWAP 

with ANIMO was efficient for the description of the N cycle in a Cerrado soil-plant-

atmosphere system.

RESUMO 

 

PINTO, V. M. Simulação da dinâmica da água e do nitrogênio em um solo de Cerrado 

cultivado com café utilizando os modelos SWAP e ANIMO. 2015. 123 p. Tese

A agricultura focada apenas na produção leva ao uso insustentável de recursos resultando em 

consequências negativas para o meio ambiente e a saúde humana. Uma consequência do uso 

excessivo de fertilizantes é a contaminação dos recursos hídricos subterrâneos e superficiais 

em ecossistemas agrícolas e nos seus arredores. Devido o solo da região do Cerrado ser pobre 

em nutrientes, predominantemente arenoso e com alta acidez, o uso de insumos agrícolas é 

intensificado e o transporte químico de nutrientes via lixiviação é um problema para a 

agricultura intensiva nas diferentes regiões. Informações sobre as atuais práticas de uso de 

fertilizantes e seus efeitos no ambiente de Cerrado precisam ser coletadas para reduzir os 

impactos da agricultura nesse ecossistema. Modelos baseados em processos físicos e químicos 

são ferramentas úteis para simular a dinâmica da água e nutrientes no meio agrícola e as 

perdas associadas aos manejos adotados, com potencial para avaliar diferentes cenários de 

previsão dos resultados dessas práticas. Entre os modelos baseados em processos, o SWAP 

(modelo Solo, Água, Atmosfera e Planta) tem sido utilizado com sucesso em várias condições 

agronômicas para descrever processos hídricos, e o ANIMO (modelo de nitrogênio na 

agricultura) para simular o ciclo do nitrogênio em sistemas agrícolas. Nosso estudo apresenta 

uma aplicação do SWAP para culturas de café perenes maduras ao longo de um ciclo 

produtivo, com foco nas perdas por drenagem e no manejo da irrigação em um sistema típico 

do Cerrado Brasileiro. A combinação dos modelos SWAP/ANIMO foi utilizada nesse estudo 

para simular a absorção de N pelas plantas de café e a lixiviação do nitrogênio na forma de 

nitrato (NO3-N) resultante de uma prática de manejo de fertilizantes intensiva. O ANIMO foi 

calibrado para o cenário correspondente à aplicação de 400 kg ha
-1

 ano
-1 

de fertilizante 

mineral, e foi avaliado com dados independentes de NO3-N na solução do solo medidos em 

parcelas de outro tratamento que receberam 800 kg ha

. O balanço hídrico anual obtido 

pelo SWAP foi semelhante ao obtido pelo balanço sequencial climatológico, de Thornthwaite 

e Matter. No entanto, os valores mensais de drenagem profunda obtidos pelo SWAP e 

comparados com os resultados do balanço climatológico apresentaram diferenças, com um 

coeficiente de determinação de 0,77 na linearização dos resultados. Cenários de irrigação com 

intervalos de 3 (IF3), 5 (IF5), 10 (IF10) e 15 (IF15) dias entre aplicações de água  foram 

simulados utilizando o SWAP e comparados com a prática de manejo da fazenda onde o 

estudo experimental foi realizado. As simulações dos cenários com o SWAP mostraram que 

as irrigações com intervalos mais longos (IF15) apresentam menores quantidades de perdas 

por drenagem, maior produtividade da água e produtividade relativa da cultura. As medidas 

de absorção de N pelas plantas obtidas experimentalmente foram similares às estimativas do 

modelo ANIMO. As analises de sensibilidade do modelo mostraram que as previsões da 

lixiviação e concentração de NO3-N na solução do solo são sensíveis às variáveis pH do solo 

e temperatura de referência dos processos de decomposição. Conclui-se que a combinação dos 

modelos unidimensionais baseados em processos SWAP/ANIMO foi eficaz na descrição do 

ciclo do N avaliado no sistema solo-planta do Cerrado.

1 Introduction 

 

The demand for food production has increased and agriculture frontiers advanced in 

the Brazilian territory.  During the last decades, the Brazilian savannah (Cerrado) was 

explored by agriculture under specific management practices, established in parts by scientific 

and technological advances (LOPES; GUILHERME; RAMOS, 2012), which allowed the 

crop cultivation in areas which were thought to be improper due to soil and weather 

conditions. 

Rada (2013) concluded that Brazil can significantly improve its position as a supplier 

of commodities if the Cerrado agriculture increases its efficiency and farmers start using 

advanced technology and management practices in the technical frontier. 

For coffee cultivation in the Cerrado, several actions have been made by institutions 

like Embrapa, which is responsible for new technologies of rational water use as, for example, 

the controlled water stress used for cultivation management and the Wastewater Cleaning 

System used for coffee fruit processing (COSTA; BESSA; FERREIRA, 2014). Bruno et al. 

(2011) and Neto et al. (2011) looked for the best application moment and dose of nitrogen for 

a coffee cultivation in a Cerrado area and their studies are examples for an efficient use of 

resources in agriculture. 

Water and fertilizer efficient use are relevant themes for coffee cultivation in the 

Cerrado and more scientific studies are needed with the aim to promote an efficient 

cultivation in this region. Significant information regarding water dynamics and nitrogen 

losses due to management practices are important for achieving these objectives. 

The recent advance in computational technology contributed for the construction of 

models that became an advantage as a tool in scientific studies. Today models can be used for 

identification of gaps in scientific knowledge, for generating and evaluating hypotheses, for 

planning experimental research, and, moreover, can be used to establish most influent 

parameters that control systems (MATHEUS; STEPHENS, 2002). Simulation models are also 

able to evaluate future scenarios, to predict specific situations and the outcomes of a system 

due to actions. The commented characteristics of modeling are desirable for studies in 

agriculture, which are full of risks and influences of weather, management, pests and diseases.  

Models in their majority can be classified as empiric or process-based, or they can 

tend to be more of one or other (or both) classifications.  Process-based models simulate in 

detail the physical and biologic processes that describe the behavior of studied systems. 



28 

 

Empiric models are simpler and are based on relations of correlation, without describing the 

system completely (ADMS et al., 2013). The process-based models although more 

comprehensive in processes description, generally require more input data and information. 

However, process-based models are more susceptible to be applied for different study 

conditions, since they are composed by general formulations, common in all terrestrial 

systems, and can be adjusted to specific situations. 

The hypothesis to be investigated in this study is that a combination of one-

dimensional process-based models is effective to simulate the dynamics of water and nitrogen 

in a highly fertirrigated coffee farming system in the Cerrado. 

The specific objectives are: 

1. Adjust SWAP and ANIMO models to a fertirrigated coffee cultivation system of the 

Cerrado and simulate the dynamics of water and nitrogen. 

2. Calibrate SWAP and ANIMO models and evaluate the sensitivity of the simulated 

processes to the input parameters and variables. 

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of SWAP/ANIMO combination to simulate nitrogen plant 

uptake, nitrate soil concentration, and nitrate leaching. 

4. Evaluate the potential of SWAP and ANIMO models to generate scenarios of 

irrigation and fertilizer management.

1.1 Introdução 

 

Aumenta a exigência pela produção em quantidade de alimentos e o cultivo agrícola 

avança para novas áreas no território Brasileiro. Nos últimos anos o ecossistema Cerrado tem 

sido explorado pela agricultura sob manejos específicos, estabelecidos em partes pelo avanço 

científico e tecnológico (LOPES; GUILHERME; RAMOS, 2012), que permitiram o cultivo 

agrícola em áreas antes caracterizadas como impróprias devido às condições de solo e clima. 

Rada (2013) sugere que o Brazil pode aumentar significativamente a sua posição na 

competição global pelo fornecimento de “commodities” agrícolas aumentando a eficiência da 

agricultura no Cerrado se houver melhorias nas técnicas de manejo e aproximação da 

tecnologia empregada por agricultores àquela da fronteira tecnológica.  

Para o cultivo do café no Cerrado, muitos esforços têm sido feitos por instituições 

como a Embrapa no Cerrado central, a qual é responsável por novas tecnologias de uso 

racional da água, podendo-se citar, por exemplo, o estresse hídrico controlado como manejo 

de cultivo e o sistema de limpeza de Águas Residuárias usado no processamento dos frutos de 

café (COSTA; BESSA; FERREIRA, 2014). Bruno et al. (2011) e Neto et al. (2011) buscaram 

o melhor momento de aplicação e dose de nitrogênio para o café do Cerrado, e são exemplos 

de medidas para um manejo eficiente de recursos na agricultura. 

O uso eficiente da água e de fertilizantes são temas relevantes para o desenvolvimento 

da cafeicultura no Cerrado. No entanto, são necessários mais estudos com propósitos de 

promover a sustentabilidade desse cultivo no Cerrado. Informações significativas a respeito 

da dinâmica da água nesses sistemas e de processos de perdas de nitrogênio ligados ao manejo 

de fertilizantes são temas importantes para alcançar estes objetivos. 

O avanço da tecnologia computacional contribuiu para que os modelos 

computacionais se tornassem uma ferramenta de suporte vantajosa em estudos científicos. 

Hoje os modelos podem ser usados na identificação de colunas no conhecimento científico, 

para gerar e testar hipóteses, com o objetivo de projetar experimentos e, além disso, podem 

ser usados na determinação dos parâmetros mais influentes de um sistema (MATHEUS; 

STEPHENS, 2002). Modelos de simulação são também ferramentas capazes de gerar cenários 

para o futuro, prever situações e respostas de um sistema a uma ação. Essas características da 

modelagem são importantes especialmente para a agricultura, a qual é permeada por riscos e 

influências do clima, do manejo agrícola, de pestes e doenças. 



30 

 

Os modelos podem ser classificados como empíricos ou baseado em processos, ou 

tender mais para uma das duas classificações. Os modelos baseados em processos simulam 

com detalhe os processos físicos e biológicos que descrevem o comportamento de um 

sistema. Os modelos empíricos são mais simples e baseiam-se em relações de correlações, 

sem descrever um sistema completamente (ADMS et al., 2013). Os modelos baseados em 

processos apesar de mais compreensivos na descrição dos processos, requerem maior número 

de dados de entrada e informações. No entanto, os modelos baseados em processos são mais 

susceptíveis a serem aplicados em diferentes condições, pois são compostos por formulações 

gerais, comuns nos sistemas terrestres e aceitam a incorporação de dados locais, podendo ser 

adequados a situações específicas.  

A hipótese desse estudo é que uma associação de modelos unidimensionais baseados 

em processos físicos é eficaz para simular a dinâmica da água e do nitrogênio em um sistema 

de cultivo de café do oeste da Bahia. 

Com o propósito de avaliar esta hipótese, este estudo tem os seguintes objetivos: 

1. Adequar os modelos SWAP e ANIMO ao um sistema de cultivo de café fertirrigado 

do Cerrado e simular a dinâmica da água e do nitrogênio. 

2. Calibrar o SWAP e o ANIMO e avaliar a sensibilidade dos processos simulados aos 

dos parâmetros de entrada dos modelos e variáveis. 

3. Avaliar o potencial da combinação SWAP/ANIMO para simular a absorção de 

nitrogênio pelas plantas, a concentração de nitrato no solo, e a lixiviação de nitrato. 

4. Avaliar o potencial dos modelos SWAP e ANIMO para gerar cenários de manejo de 

irrigação e manejo de fertilizantes.

2 Deep drainage modeling for a fertigated coffee plantation in the Brazilian 

Cerrado 

 

Abstract 

 

Modeling in agriculture represents an important tool to understand processes as water and 

nutrient losses by drainage, or to test different conditions and scenarios of soil and crop 

management. Among the existing computational models to describe hydrological processes, 

SWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant model) has been successfully used under several 

conditions. This model was originally developed to simulate short cycle crops and its use also 

to cover longer cycles, e.g. perennial crops, is a new application. This report shows a SWAP 

application to a mature coffee crop over one-production cycle, focusing on deep drainage 

losses in a typical soil-plant-atmosphere system of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). The 

estimated annual deep drainage Q = 1019 mm obtained by SWAP was within 99% of the 

value determined by the climatologic water balance of 1010 mm. Monthly results of SWAP 

for Q compared to the estimative using the climatological method presented a determination 

coefficient of 0.77. A variety of coffee fertigation scenarios was simulated using SWAP and 

compared to farmer’s management scenario, leading to the conclusion that larger irrigation 

intervals result in lower Q losses, better water productivity and higher crop yield. ?

2.1 Introduction 

 

The savanna ecoregion (Cerrado) prevails in central Brazil, also reaching the northeast 

part of the country and including part of the state of Bahia. The Cerrado domain in Bahia is 

highly suitable for irrigated agriculture due to the great availability of surface and 

underground water resources. According to Brazil's National Grain Supply Company 

(CONAB), western Bahia is an important food (grain) provider and holds, for example, the 

highest coffee yield under Cerrado conditions in the country. However, there are some 

concerns in respect to the modern agriculture practiced in this producer region. Due to the 

ineffective land management during the last decades, the irrigated farms concentrated at 

specific areas and, therefore, conflicts over water use already took place in western Bahia 

(LIMA, 2011).  At the same time, management practices applied by farmers are not 

sustainable in terms of fertilizer and water usage, especially due to the lack of scientific 

studies that support their decisions (BRUNO et al., 2011).   

Numerical modeling applied to agriculture is a useful tool to simulate biophysical 

processes and can be used to obtain short-term results and future predictions under defined 

scenarios. The information generated is helpful for establishing a more sustainable agriculture 

as well as supporting strategies for the mitigation of pollution, named by Strauch et al. (2013) 

as the “Best Management Practices”. The hydrological model SWAP (Soil, Water, 

Atmosphere and Plant) is one of the existing algorithms used worldwide for a variety of soils, 

crops and climatic conditions (CHIRICO et al., 2013; CRESCIMANNO; MORGA; 

VENTRELL, 2012; EITZINGER et al., 2004; KAMBLE et al., 2013; MA et al., 2011; 

NOORY et al., 2011). The model has shown consistent results when applied to maize crops in 

sub-tropical climates (PINHEIRO et al., 2013) and to soybeans and common beans in tropical 

climates (SCORZA JUNIOR; SILVA; RIGITANO, 2010; DURIGON et al., 2012). SWAP 

was successfully validated already under several climatic and environmental conditions as 

cited Ines et al. (2006).  More recent studies with this model found close agreement between 

measured and simulated values (MISHRA et al., 2013; SINGH; REN; KANG, 2010; UTSET 

et al., 2007; VAZIFEDOUST et al., 2008; VERMA; GUPTA; ISAAC, 2012). 

This study aimed to use SWAP to evaluate the deep drainage of a Cerrado coffee 

plantation and analyze irrigation scenarios in view of water productivity and conservation, 

minimizing environmental impacts. Values of SWAP input parameters were acquired from a 

one-year experimental database coming from a study performed on a mature coffee crop 

growing in central Brazil (BORTOLOTTO et al., 2011; 2012; BRUNO et al., 2011).  



35 
 

 

The computer simulations focused on improving water usage and understanding of water 

dynamics in a sandy soil typical of the Brazilian Cerrado, an area intensively used to grow 

perennial crops. We studied several scenarios of irrigation to improve water productivity for 

the chosen area. 

 

2.2 Materials and methods 

 

2.1.1 The Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant model (SWAP) 

 

The model SWAP was developed more than 40 years ago and was gradually upgraded 

reaching its last version SWAP 3.2 (KROES et al., 2008). This last version of the model had 

the source code restructured, numerical stability improved, macropore process integrated, and 

simplification of precipitation and evapotranspiration inputs included (VAN DAM et al., 

2008). 

SWAP makes use of Richards' equation in one dimension added by the sink terms (S) 

to calculate the water movement in the soil matrix, as follows: 

? ?
K( ) 1

h
h

hz
S h

t z

?

? ??? ?
? ?? ?? ?

? ? ?? ?
? ?

? ?     
 (2.1) 

 

where ? (cm
3
 cm

-3
) is the volumetric soil water content, t (d) time, S (cm

3
 cm

-3
 d

-1
) the soil 

extraction rate by plant roots, K (cm d
-1

) the soil hydraulic conductivity, h (cm) the soil water 

pressure head and z (cm) the vertical coordinate taken positively upwards. SWAP uses 

Richards' equation for describing water flux in the unsaturated and saturated zones of the soil 

and solves the equation (2.1) numerically, using the relations between ?, h and K, with the 

Mualem-van Genuchten relations ?(h) and K(h)  (MUALEM, 1976; VAN GENUCHTEN, 

1980). 

 The upper boundary conditions in SWAP are determined according to the rates of 

potential evapotranspiration ETp (mm), irrigation I (mm) and precipitation P (mm) of the area 

under study. Daily ETp is calculated with the Penman-Monteith equation (MONTEITH, 1965; 

1981) using meteorological data of air temperature Tair (ºC), solar radiation RAD (kJ m
-2

), 

wind speed Sw (m s
-1

) and air humidity Ha (kPa). 

 

 



36 

 

The water balance is determined as in equation (2.2): 

 

s a i
W P I ET RO P Q?? ? ? ? ? ? ?    (2.2) 

 

where Ws (mm) is the soil water storage in a defined elemental soil volume, ETa (mm) the 

actual evapotranspiration, RO (mm) the run-off and run-on, Pi (mm) the canopy water 

interception and Q (mm) the soil water drained at the lower boundary, equal to -Qd or +Qcr. 

The percolation Qd is downwards and Qcr the upwards, when the capillary rise is present. Qd 

can still be subdivided into the components QdI, due to irrigation, and QdP, due to the rainfall.  

Actual evapotranspiration is calculated considering the reduction of root water uptake when 

there is water or salinity stress, and the reduction of soil water content due to the soil surface 

drying.  The actual transpiration Ta (mm) is obtained as follows: 

0

( ) z

d

a

R

T S z d
?

? ?      (2.3) 

 

where the lower integration limit Rd is rooting depth and S the root water flux, which is 

related to the potential transpiration Tp (mm). During water stress, S(z) is described in SWAP 

as proposed by Feddes, Kowalik and Zaradny (1978). In this function, the root water uptake is 

regulated by the critical pressure head values h1 (point where water extraction ceases due to 

anoxia), h2 (begin of constant maximum root extraction), h3 (end of constant maximum root 

extraction), h4 (wilting point, where root extraction ends). The actual evaporation is 

determined by Darcy’s relation and empirically either according to Black, Gardner and 

Thurtell (1969) or to Boesten and Stroosnijder (1986), to be selected by the SWAP user. The 

bottom boundary condition is adjusted by the user and can be, for example, prescribed with 

pressure head values of the bottom soil compartment, calculated as a function of the 

groundwater level, or the boundary condition can be the free drainage of the soil profile. 

SWAP contains simple and detailed crop growth modules, which should be selected 

by the user according to the available plant data. In the simple model the user provides the 

leaf area index (LAI), crop factor (Kc) and rooting depth as a function of the crop development 

stage (DS). These data are used to calculate the canopy interception Pi, potential transpiration 

Tp and potential evaporation Ep.

2.2.2 Experimental site and field experiment 

 

An experimental test used to calibrate and compare the results of the SWAP model 

was performed between August 1
st
, 2008 and July 31

st
, 2009, at a private farm near the city of 

Barreiras (11°46’00’’ S, 45°43’32’’ W), in Bahia, northeast Brazil (Figure 2.1). The soil is 

classified as a Typic Hapludox according to the USDA Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 

2010), with low natural fertility and is located in a Cerrado region. The precipitation is very 

variable, ranging from 800 to 1800 mm per year, with most events occurring from October to 

April. Meteorological data, acquired from the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET, 

Brazil), were collected at the meteorological station of the municipality of Barreiras, 90 km 

far from the experimental site. The input variables farmer irrigation depths and precipitation 

along the experimental year used for SWAP simulations are shown in Figure 2.2. Irrigation is 

not discontinued during the rainy season due to the fertilizer application carried out year 

round.

The coffee species was Coffea Arabica L., variety Catuaí Vermelho. Plants were seven 

years old at the beginning of the experiment and were planted at a spacing of 3.8 m between 

lines and 0.5 m between plants in a circular arrangement for central pivot irrigation with a 

total area of 80 ha, adapted for fertigation. Irrigation was applied homogeneously over the 

planted area, and the experimental site consisted of the pivot circle number 4, starting from 

the center of the coffee plantation (BRUNO et al., 2011). Irrigation was performed by LEPA-

type emitters, which distribute the water according to the circular coffee lines, avoiding the 

application of water in the interrow. The pivot operation was continuous during the year and 

stopped only during harvest (May-June), according to farmer´s practice.  

For the saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks (cm d
-1

), soil bulk density ?s (g cm
-3

) and 

soil particle size analyzes, soil samples were extracted from soil layers 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 

40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm (Table 2.1) in the coffee field. In the laboratory, the constant 

head method (REYNOLDS et al., 2002) was employed for obtaining Ks. Soil water retention 

curves were constructed using sieved soil samples (2 mm sieve), assuming for sandy soils the 

structure of the samples is of little importance. Samples of each soil layer were submitted to 

the pressures of 100, 200, 330, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000, 15000 cm of water in the 

laboratory, using the Richards pressure plate extractors. A soil water retention curve was 

established by fitting the van Genuchten (VG) model to all water retention data (R² = 0.88) 

for the 1 m soil profile, using the RETC program (VAN GENUCHTEN; LEIJ; YATES, 

1991).

2.2.3 Climatologic Water Balance 

 

Previous studies were performed in this coffee plantation as mentioned before, and the 

hydrological evaluation of this area was achieved by Bortolotto et al. (2012). In their study, 

the Climatologic Water Balances (CWB) were calculated for the pivot area with time intervals 

of 5 days, during the entire one-year coffee producing cycle, using a sequential method 

proposed by Rolim, Sentelhas and Barbieri (1998). Due to the characteristics of the 

plantation, flat and well drained with a deep water table located several meters below the soil 

surface, the RO was considered to be zero, as well as Qcr. Bortolotto et al. (2012) estimated 

ETp by the Thornthwaite (1948) and Penman-Monteith (1965) models. They considered the 

coffee crop factor (Kc) as equal to 1.0, based on studies that showed values in the range of 0.6

CAMARGO, 2008; SANTINATO; FERNANDES; FERNANDES, 1996). The sequential 

CWB in Bortolotto et al. (2012) assumes Pi = 0 and calculates a component called water 

excess (EXC), which includes RO and Q. As RO and Qcr are considered zero, EXC = Q = Qd 

is assumed, and Q is only the downward drainage which is lost from the crop below the 1 m 

depth.
 

 

2.2.4 Parameter estimation 

 

Information about soil hydrology, plant, and meteorological data are the SWAP input 

requirements to run it. The model works with a collection of input files: main file, crop file, 

irrigation file and meteorological files for each year of the simulation. The irrigation file 

requires dates and amounts of water applied by irrigation and the meteorological file requires 

daily variables: air temperature Tair (ºC), solar radiation RAD (kJ m
-2

), wind speed Sw (m s
-1

), 

air vapor pressure Ha (kPa), and P (mm).  

The water balance components were simulated for each month during the one-year 

period of study. The moment of crop emergence was set on August 1
st
, 2008 and the crop 

harvest was on July 31
st
, 2009, the period of the coffee cycle (BRUNO et al., 2011). The 

amount of water applied by irrigation was scheduled as shown in Figure 2.2. 

The initial pressure head distribution in the soil was unknown and necessary for the 

water balance simulation, so the pressure head distribution in the soil profile at the end of one 

year of the first simulation with SWAP was used thereafter as the initial condition. The soil 

profile (0-1 m) was divided into three sub-layers with thicknesses of 10, 40 and 50 cm, each 

sub-layer containing 10, 8 and 5 layers with 1, 5 and 10 cm width, respectively. This 

possibility of soil profile discrimination in SWAP allows us to analyze in details the evolution 

of predicted ? and h in the time frame. The bottom-boundary condition of free drainage of the 

soil profile was selected in SWAP because the water table is located several meters below the 

soil surface. In this case, the bottom flux of the SWAP soil profile is equal to the hydraulic 

conductivity in the last soil compartment, as the gradient of water potential in soils under 

drainage can be assumed to be unity (KROES et al., 2008). 

The empirical parameter of pore connectivity ?, proposed by Mualem (1976), is 

difficult to be evaluated directly.  According to data compiled by De Jong van Lier, Dourado-

Neto and Metselaar (2009), values of ? commonly vary between 6 and -6, whereas values of 

0.5 or 0 are more often used.  Therefore, several values of ? were used in the sensitivity 



41 
 

 

analysis to show the influence of this parameter in our simulations. An average Ks-value 

(from Table 2.1) representative of the 1 m soil layer was used in the simulations. 

The SWAP simple crop module requires information of the leaf area index, crop 

factor, maximum rooting depth as a function of the development stage, as well as the light 

extinction coefficient and the critical pressure head values of the Feddes distribution 

(FEDDES; KOWALIK; ZARADNY, 1978). The model is recommended for annual crops 

with short growing cycles, up to one-year maximum. Nonetheless, a small number of studies 

applied SWAP to perennial plants, including wine grapes  (BEN-ASHER et al., 2006; 

RALLO et al., 2012) and citrus (MARTÍNEZ-FERRI; MURIEL-FÉRNANDEZ; 

RODRÍGUEZ DÍAZ, 2013). Because not all the data needed about the coffee plant was 

available in the database of Bruno et al. (2011) and Bortolotto et al. (2012), the simple crop 

module was our choice to represent the coffee plantation.  

Coffee leaf area index (LAI) was estimated from leaf dry matter (available in BRUNO 

et al., 2011), the measured specific leaf area, SLA (18 m² kg
-1

), per plant soil cover,  

SCA (1.9 m²). A variety of coffee leaf sizes was collected from the same experimental plants 

in 2013 to determine the average SLA. The obtained values of LAI for different stages  

(LAI0, LAI50%, LAI75% and LAI100%) along the experimental cycle are shown in Table 2.3.  

For the characterization of the coffee crop in SWAP, we assumed a constant crop 

coefficient Kc for the entire year, equal to 1.1 (ALLEN et al., 1998). The coffee rooting depth 

Rd, as measured by Bortolotto et al. (2012) and Bruno et al. (2011) reaches the maximum 

depth of 1 m and was considered constant during the experimental year. Additional 

information about the root density (Ry) distribution along the soil profile was obtained for the 

crop based on visual observations of Bruno et al. (2011). Four times during the experimental 

year they collected an entire plant and measured the dry matter of leaves, branches, and roots, 

as well as root depth and distribution in the soil profile. According to these authors, the 

relative root density is abundant from the surface down to the 0.6 m depth, decreasing linearly 

from there until zero at 1 m. 

The coefficient kgr is the product of the extinction diffuse light coefficient for visible 

light (kdif) and the extinction coefficient for direct visible light (kdir). The parameter kgr was 

analyzed using values between 0.2 and 2.2 (KROES et al., 2008) in the analysis of sensitivity. 

Measurements of the extinction coefficient of coffee are rare in the literature. Field 

measurements with a five-year-old coffee plantation of the São Paulo region showed an 

extinction coefficient of 0.53 for an average LAI equal to 3.8 (ANGELOCCI et al., 2008).  



42 

 

The interception coefficient of Von Hoyningen-Hune and Braden (ic) was selected for the 

present study from Kroes et al. (2008), for ordinary crops. 

The information regarding the limiting pressure head for soil water extraction by plant 

roots is described in the SWAP crop file. Between h1 and h2 water extraction by roots is 

assumed to increase linearly towards low values of h. The optimal root water uptake occurs 

between h2 and h3h (at high potential transpiration) or h3l (at low potential transpiration). The 

wilting point was selected to be h4 = -15000 cm. The values h3 are those recommended for 

deciduous fruit plants shown in Taylor and Ashcroft (1972), which is the kind of plant that 

better adjusts to the characteristics of the coffee crops. The parameter values established in the 

soil and crop files for SWAP simulations in this study (Table 2.3) were called standard 

values.

2.2.5 Model evaluation 

 

In the analysis of sensitivity regarding the standard values of the parameters presented 

in Table 2.3, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (SMITH et al., 1997) was used and 

calculated using Equation (2.4). SWAP Qi simulations obtained with those standard values 

were compared with SWAP Qi’ simulations obtained when varying one of them and 

maintaining all other constant. The lower the value of RMSE, the smaller the sensitivity of the 

model to the varied parameter.

where Bi are monthly values of Q or ETa from Bortolotto et al. (2012), iF  
the corresponding 

SWAP forecasted values, and k the number of observations. In this case, the lower the value 

of RMSE, the closer the proximity of the predicted Fi values to the Bi values. 

To estimate Q errors for SWAP simulations, meteorological data were generated 

advancing and retarding the variables one and two days in relation to the real meteorological 

data presented in Figure 2.2.  This approach resulted in five sets of monthly values of Q for 

which the averages and standards deviation were obtained, showed by bars in Figure 2.6. 

 

2.2.6 Parameter sensitivity 

 

The sensitivity of the SWAP model in relation to the crop (Kc, LAI, Kdif, Kdir, Rd, h3h 

and h3l) and hydrological soil parameters (?s, ?r, n, ? and ?) was performed before and after 

establishing the standard values (Table 2.3) of the parameters for the simulation. Before the 

establishment of standard values, a visual analysis was carried out by trial and error to detect 

the most sensitive plant and soil parameters. Afterward, a second analysis of sensitivity for 

soil parameters was made using several combinations of VG parameters. RMSE values were 

obtained replacing the standard combination of parameters by upper (?s

lower (?s

) values, according to Table 2.2. Each parameter was substituted once and 

the simulation with SWAP was performed.  In the case of crop parameters, they were changed 

by 10% and 50% of the standard combination (Table 2.3), to obtain RMSE values.  

 

2.2.7 Irrigation scenarios and water productivity 

 

Different scenarios of irrigation were analyzed with the model, aiming to determine 

more efficient water managements in relation to deep drainage losses and water use efficiency 

at the farm under study. The irrigation scenarios were classified according to irrigation 

frequencies (IF), choosing intervals of 3 (IF3), 5 (IF5), 10 (IF10) and 15 (IF15) days between 

applications. For each IFi, the amount of water applied was obtained based on the net 

irrigation depth (ID) between 1 and 50 mm (discounting P from I within each period), and 

when precipitation was higher than or equal to ID, irrigation was not applied. The scenarios 

with no irrigation and farmer irrigation management (IFFarmer) were also evaluated, totalizing 

34 setups (Table 2.4). The criterion for the irrigation scenarios was that I should not be too 

low (i.e. &amp;lt;40mm) or too high (i.e. &gt; 900mm) during the year, ensuring the comparison 

between the scenarios for the several IF.

 For each irrigation scenario, the water productivity WPI+P (kg m

), which relates crop 

yield to water use, and the actual yield Ya (t ha
-1

), were calculated by Equations (2.5) and 

(2.6), respectively, for the interpretation of the effects of the scenarios during a year of coffee 

production.

) and 

the coffee harvest index of 0.012 (NAIR, 1993).  

As water is available in large quantities from rainfall and irrigation during the entire 

year, water stress conditions were not expected to take place. Coffee fruit productivity used 

here is the potential one. Calculated WP is a relative number because it was affected only by 

the irrigation scenarios and meteorological data. The WP relation is a new way to characterize 

water productivity, and it was described in details by Vazifedoust et al. (2008). 

 

2.3 Results and discussion 

 

An application of the SWAP model is presented for a perennial crop during one 

experimental year. SWAP input parameters and their influence on the simulations of the 

components of the water balance Q and ETa were evaluated. For plant characterization, 

experimental data and information from studies found in the literature were used, and a simple 

coffee plant model was established for one year in 2008/2009. Water balances simulated by 

SWAP were then compared to a study developed in the same Cerrado area. After the model 

calibration, scenarios of irrigation were appraised looking for the best management that would 

benefit water and coffee productivity when compared to the farmer´s actual practices.

2.3.1 Sensitivity analysis and model calibration  

 

Table 2.5 shows results of the RMSE for the estimations of Q for the several values of 

? and combinations of VG parameters. Soil hydrological parameters assumed either the upper 

or lower value of a given VG parameter, delimiting the 95% confidence interval. When one 

parameter had its value changed from the standard value, the others remained in the standard 

combination. RMSE in relation to Q estimation was more sensitive to variations in ?. In this 

analysis, we varied ? between 6 and -6, but for values of ? equal to -6 and one value for -3 the 

simulations with SWAP resulted in the non-convergence of Richards’ equation. Changes in 

VG parameters only affect the simulations of RMSE for Q slightly, and the shape parameter n 

had the greatest influence. RMSE-value equal to zero corresponds to the standard combination 

of VG and Mualem parameters.

We also studied the influence of Ks on model results of the water balance. For the 

component Q, the RMSE did not show great differences when Ks varies from 26 to 455 cm d
-1

.  

The component Q is highly affected by Mualem’s ? (Table 2.5).  The effect that the 

pore connectivity produces on the results of water balance components may be clarified by 



48 

 

the behavior of the hydraulic conductivity function for different values of ?, shown in Figure 

2.3 

Almost all the h-values occurring during the experimental year remain in the range -60 

to -15000 cm, where the K function can take several shapes depending on ?. An appropriate 

value of ? for the sandy soil should be determined, however, to obtain a more precise 

evaluation of the soil-plant system under study. Similar results of ? effects on the hydraulic 

conductivity function can be found in Sakai et al. (2009)  

 

 

Figure 2.3 – Hydraulic conductivity K (cm d

) versus soil water pressure head h (cm) for different 

values of the pore connectivity parameter ? 

 

SWAP results in Figure 2.4 showed the soil pressure head values between -1 and -25 

cm was not reached in this study and, therefore, h1 did not affect the simulated results. 

Pressure head h remains in the range of -100 and -15000 during the dry period and the range 

of -60 and -1000 cm during the rest of the year (wet period). In relation to soil evaporation, no 

difference was found in the annual result when applying the procedures of Black, Gardner and 

Thurtell (1969) or Boesten and Stroosnijder (1986). Soil evaporation simulated with SWAP is 

almost insignificant (lower than 1 mm y
-1

) and consequently no effect would be expected to 

happen when changing the method of calculation.

Table 2.6 shows the results of SWAP sensitivity analysis in relation to selected plant 

input parameters. As shown the results of Q-RMSE in this study, variations in the coffee light 

extinction coefficients (kdif and kdir), Rd, ic and LAI in the SWAP crop file did not affect  

Q-values significantly. The parameters kdif and kdir are used in the calculation of soil 

evaporation, which in the conditions of the present study were very low, explaining the low 

influence of these parameters on the WB values. The LAI values estimated from leaf dry 

matter data were relatively high (Table 2.3) compared to literature values, however they can 



50 

 

be acceptable when comparing to measurements performed in 2-4 years old coffee plants in 

the literature (GUTIÉRREZ; MEINZER, 1994). The analysis of sensitivity of LAI was not 

possible for +10% and +50% of the standard value because the results were higher than the 

maximum value allowable by SWAP. The critical soil water pressure head parameters were 

also evaluated in the sensitivity analysis and did almost not influence Q simulations with 

SWAP. The parameter Kc effected SWAP simulations for Q considerably, as Q-RMSE 

variations related to changes in this parameter were high.

2.3.2 Model comparison 

 

The comparison between SWAP predictions and Bortolotto’s values of Q and ETa is 

shown in Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6. The monthly results of Q simulated with SWAP deviated 

from those of Bortolotto et al. (2012), presenting a linear relationship with R² = 0.77 (Figure 

2.5a). Figure 2.5a shows specific months, those with the highest Q found during the year, 

responsible for the deviation of the tendency line. The resulted RMSE for Q is around 43 mm, 

a response to the predicted values in November and December of 2008, and March and April 

of 2009 (Figure 2.6). On these dates, a similar behavior for Q predictions by both models can 

be observed: in the months of November and March, Q simulated by SWAP resulted lower 

than the result of CWB, and in the respective next month of December and April, the inverse 

behavior occurred, Q obtained by CWB was lower than the simulated by SWAP. In the 

course of simulations, the water saved in one month is delivered to the next two months for 



51 
 

 

both periods evaluated, the behavior of Q becoming closer to the 1:1 line in the third month of 

the sequence (Figures 2.5a and 2.6a). 

This behavior of retaining and distributing water during the following months is 

confirmed when comparing the ETa curves simulated in SWAP with those obtained by 

Bortolotto et al. (2012). These curves had similar results. Considering there are only two ways 

of losing water from this system (by evapotranspiration and drainage), the water transported 

by drainage Q in the simulations with SWAP is just distributed differently from Bortolotto’s 

during the year.

During the dry period of the experimental year, from July to November of 2008 

(Figure 2.4a), soil pressure head at depths 65, 75, 85 and 95 cm assumed values equal to or 

very close to -15000 cm. However, h did not remain at these low values for a long time, a 

maximum of 23 days for the 85 cm depth in September and 12 days for the 65 cm depth in 

October. The behavior of h in the 65-95 cm soil layer during the dry period can initially (from 

August to September) be understood by the infiltration of water from irrigation and later due 

to the rain events of September (P = 31 mm in four days) and the beginning of November  

(P = 90.5 mm in two days). Irrigation water did not reach layers deeper than 95 cm during 

August and most of September, since h in this region decreases almost linearly and stabilizes 

at -15000 cm, increasing only due to the large rain event in late September. The rain events of 

November make the pressure head increase and become almost uniform along the soil profile. 

The simulated Q is, therefore, nearly zero from August to October of 2008 (Figure 2.6a), 

confirming there is no drainage due to irrigation during the dry period of the year. The water 

delivered by irrigation and rainfall during the dry period is retained in the 1 m of the soil 

profile and is kept available to plants or deep drainage in the wet period.  

The simulated results of ETa showed to be close to the observations of Bortolotto et al. 

(2012) since the linear regression between them was obtained with R² = 0.9. However, the 

model SWAP predicted ETa values lower than those of CWB (Figure 2.5b). SWAP takes into 

consideration plant characteristics as already mentioned for the estimation of Ea and Ta. Since 

the ETa calculation in Bortotlotto et al. (2012) is based only on soil water storage variations 

and the amount of precipitation, we should not expect an exact agreement between 

Bortolotto´s data and SWAP simulations.  

The uncertainties of SWAP modeling for Q due to the meteorological input data and 

variations in Ks are shown in Figure 2.6a and 2.6b (see item 2.5). Based on the results of 

Figure 2.6a, we verified Q is highly influenced by the meteorological values and can vary 

more in the wet months. During the dry period of the year the uncertainties are smaller, which 

lead to the conclusion Q is mainly governed by the precipitation. Figure 2.6b shows the 

uncertainties of Q simulated with SWAP due to variations of Ks values from 26 m d
-1

 to 455 

m d
-1

, measured by laboratory tests.  

In the CWB method, when the amount of precipitation of an event exceeds ETp and at 

the same time soil available water capacity (AWC) is fulfilled due to antecedent rainfalls, 

there is an excess of water considered to be Q. Results of drainage Q obtained in Bortolotto et 

al. (2012) present uncertainties however due to specific considerations on the AWC 

calculations. In that study, the AWC was calculated as the difference in the soil water storage 



54 

 

at field capacity (considered to be characterized by h = -33 kPa) and at wilting point  

(at h = -1,500 kPa). Nevertheless, the pressure head at field capacity can vary from -10 kPa to 

-33 kPa accordingly to the soil type and characteristics (RICHARDS; TIMM, 2004). 

Increasing field capacity to h=-10 kPa, for example, would increase directly the AWC and 

reduce Q amount obtained by CWB. This change in AWC could possibly approximate the Q 

results of CWB and SWAP model in Figure 2.6. 

Table 2.7 presents the components of the annual water balance obtained by SWAP and 

the estimated results of Bortolotto et al. (2012). Although the monthly differences shown in 

Figure 2.6, the annual results of the components Q and ETa ended up very close. As shown by 

the simulations of SWAP, only a small portion of the water entering the system during the 

year is converted into Pi. However, this component is much higher than the annual Ea that was 

0.6 mm. These results could be consequences of the high density of leaves in the plantation 

since the coffee plants are at full maturity. Conclusively, all the water assigned as ETa in 

Table 2.7 represents plant transpiration.

2.3.3 Scenarios of irrigation 

 

In order to generate new information on water management for coffee cultivation in 

the west of the state of Bahia, several scenarios of irrigation were simulated with SWAP 

(Figures 2.7 and 2.8). With this information, we planned to demonstrate the influence of I on 

Q, and also to analyze different possibilities of management, in contraposition to the choice of 

the farmer. Usually, irrigation water is applied in several volumes distributed during the year 

by the farmers, and this routine is necessary because they fertigate the crop year round. 



55 
 

 

Alternatively, this information would also serve to lead farmers to adopt more sustainable 

practices of water management in this agricultural region. 

 

Figure 2.7 – a) Annual drainage due irrigation only QdI (mm) and b) annual plant transpiration Ta 

(mm) for different irrigation frequencies (IF) as a function of the amount of water applied I (mm) 

throughout the experimental year 

 

SWAP simulation with no irrigation yielded the value of QdP, the drainage only due to 

rainfall (833.4 mm), which is very high, showing the rainfall is the main factor responsible for 

Q in the annual balance. This value was subtracted from the total Q to obtain QdI, the drainage 

due to irrigation only.  For all simulations of Figure 2.7a, we present QdI maintaining the 

actual rainfall (2008/2009). 



56 

 

Each of the four curves in Figure 2.7a was fitted to a 2
nd

 order polynomial model to 

appreciate their behavior better. Results indicate that QdI values tend to be lower when the 

frequency of irrigation is high (IF3), which can be verified comparing the results for a fixed I. 

As an example, for 400 mm, the values of QdI from the respective regression curves are  

24 mm for IF15, 63 mm for IF10, 109 mm for IF5, and 129 mm for IF3. In this case,  

QdI increases 39 mm from IF15 to IF10, 46 mm from IF10 to IF5, and 20 mm from IF5 to IF3, 

showing there is a considerable rise in QdI when reducing the irrigation frequency. Taking the 

amount of water applied by farmers (I = 697 mm), the correspondent QdI is 134 mm (IF15), 

205 mm (IF10), 248 mm (IF5), and 282 (IF3). As it can be observed, farmer’s irrigation 

management (IFFarmer) practically encloses the IF10 curve. The IF10 and IF15 scenarios are 

characterized by having several days between applications of water and consequently in these 

scenarios there is no irrigation during the wet period of the year. 

Plant response to irrigation scenarios is presented in Figure 2.7b. For fixed values of I, 

Ta increases as the frequency of irrigation (IF) decreases. Larger intervals of irrigation might 

induce a drier microclimate in the canopy, therefore, increasing Ta.  Both results of Ta and  

Q showed there is less loss of water by drainage (more loss by transpiration) when the 

irrigation is applied with greater time intervals.  For all the scenarios, there is a tendency of 

QdI and Ta to increase with the amount of water used yearly by the irrigation. 

 



57 
 

 

 

Figure 2.8 - a) Water productivity WPP+I (kg m
-3

) and b) actual yield Ya for different irrigation 

frequencies (IF) and amount of water applied I (mm) throughout the experimental year 

 

The effect of irrigation scenarios on the soil-plant system is interpreted in a different 

perspective when looking at water productivity (WP) outcomes. These results showed there is 

a limit for the amount of water used during the year, which is confirmed by the peak values in 

each curve of Figure 2.8a. For the same amount of irrigation, the difference between WP for 

the several IF-curves in Figure 2.8a does not pass 1.12 kg m
-3

 (1.12 kg of dry matter per ha, 

per mm of water).  This relative low influence of I on the results of WPP+I can be attributed to 

the dominant rainfall in this coffee cultivation region. In any case, when analyzing the 

efficiency of the irrigation scenarios, not only WP should be considered, but also the 

respective Q. 



58 

 

The maximum values of WPI+P obtained from the regression curves in Figure 2.8a 

occurred when I was between 530 and 630 mm.  When water was applied in intervals of 15 

days (IF15) during the year, the WP had the highest values. The best management practice, 

however, would bring benefits not just to water conservation, but also to coffee productivity. 

Figure 2.8b showed the actual coffee yield Ya increased as a results of I increments. Any 

irrigation scenario with I between 650 and 750 mm and water application intervals of 15 days 

(IF15) (Table 2.8), would result in higher Ya values and also of WP in relation to the farmer´s 

management scenario (IFFarmer).  The scenario IFFarmer resulted in Ya equal to 238 t ha
-1

 and 

WPI+P equal to 10.70 kg m
-3 

(10.70 kg ha
-1

 mm
-1

), which is not so different from the most 

efficient irrigation management (WPI+P that is around 11.06 kg m
-3

, Figure 2.8a). In 

comparison, when I is extrapolated to 700 mm, with IF15, Ya would result in 248 t ha
-1

, WPI+P 

in 10.90 kg m
-3

, and the corresponding QI reduced by 49 mm in comparison to the farmer’s 

irrigation scenario. Considering the time scale of coffee cultivation can reach up to 18 years, a 

yearly reduction of QdI and the increase of Ya presented above, although relatively small, 

would greatly benefit water conservation and groundwater pollution, as well as coffee 

productivity.

Low-frequency irrigation scenario could lead to a too dry soil condition in some 

periods of the year, considering the annual rainfall distribution in the area defines wet and dry 

periods. Evaluating the h-values in the soil profile for the scenario IF15 (I = 460.5 mm), as an 

example, it can be verified the soil water depletion occurs during the months of September 

and October from depths 48 to 95 cm (Figure 2.9). When analyzing monthly data, these low 

values of h apparently have a potential effect on plant transpiration. From SWAP simulation 

outcomes, plant transpiration in September isTa = 107 mm (Tp = 145 mm) and in October is 

Ta = 85 mm (Tp = 197 mm). Daily h-values in this soil layer reveal the soil remains close to 

wilting conditions for about 45 days and Ta tends to decrease and reaches almost zero three 

times. An excessive depletion of the available water can convey irreversible consequences in 

coffee productivity and development, and this situation could occur for the scenarios with low 

amounts of water applied in the IF15 or IF10 choices. On the other hand, the coffee plant stress 

by a lack of water during a certain period of the year could bring benefits for production, as 

presented in the technical report of Guerra et al. (2005).  

 

Figure 2.9 – Daily values of soil water pressure head h (cm) predicted by SWAP during the year at soil 

depths of 0.5, 18, 48, 75 and 95 cm, for the irrigation scenario I equal to 460.5 mm and IF of 15 days 

  



61 
 

 

We analyzed a year in which rainfall was considerably high (1535 mm), and this is an 

important detail to be considered for a complete search of the best management practice. As 

cited before, rainfall averages range from 800 to 1800 mm and, therefore, in a dry year, the 

results of the irrigation scenarios could be driven to distinct results of water use efficiency. 

The stochastic employment of meteorological data or exclusively of the rainfall applied in 

SWAP would be highly recommended for a complete evaluation of the behavior of the 

irrigation scenarios and also for the analysis of climate effects. Bennett, Bishop and Vervoot 

(2013) introduced a stochastic approach with SWAP to quantify time and space uncertainties 

in deep drainage due to rainfall, land management and soil hydraulic properties in Australia. 

Rainfall was the most important factor and a source of uncertainty to be considered for the 

drainage predictions in that study, and precise rainfall data is required in such kind of study. 

Another point to be concerned with is that the studied coffee plants were fully mature, and 

these predictions should be re-evaluated for young coffee crops.   

This application of SWAP tried to find the best adjustment of the model to a perennial 

crop and showed ways of using it to evaluate the possibility for improvements in irrigation 

management. Some concerns exist nevertheless in respect to our evaluations, since the 

outcomes are restricted to the one-year of available experimental data, and a proper validation 

of model simulations was not possible. Our conclusions from the presented evaluations and 

scenarios with SWAP are subject to such limitations. 

 

2.4 Conclusions 

 

 This study showed the potential of the SWAP model for studying a perennial crop in a 

Cerrado ecosystem in Brazil and for generating irrigation scenarios. SWAP’s most sensitive 

input parameters were determined experimentally and other less sensitive were obtained from 

the literature to establish the calibration. Model simulations for monthly drainage when 

compared to the climatological water balance CWB data generated a determination coefficient 

R² of 0.77. Therefore, we assumed SWAP is already a validated model widely tested and 

proved to be efficient in different parts of the world. For that reason, we could predict 

scenarios of irrigation for our region of coffee cultivation. 

Irrigation scenarios simulated with SWAP for the experimental year showed to be 

efficient in water use and coffee productivity when longer intervals of irrigation were used. 

According to this analysis, adopting an irrigation interval of 15 days and yearly water amount 

between 650 and 750 mm could be an option for better management compared to the farmer’s 



62 

 

scenario.  The results of water productivity, plant productivity, and deep drainage indicated 

the farmer’s management practices could be improved, minimizing loss of water by drainage 

and at the same time increasing coffee production. The information presented here should 

support farmers to improve their water irrigation management practices and alert them to 

environmental losses that might occur in these heavily fertilized coffee plantations in western 

Bahia, Brazil. 

 Some concerns still exist, however, with respect to the performed simulations: 1) there 

was limited experimental data for the simulations (a one-year period); this could be improved 

with a new study with information about the coffee plant and the SWAP plant module being 

structured year by year; 2) the absence of model validation with proper data; 3)  

the deterministic approach here used  could be replaced by a new stochastic evaluation 

applied to meteorological and soil hydrological data, to solve spatial and temporal limitations 

of the simulations.

3 Modeling nitrogen dynamics in a fertigated coffee plantation in the 

Brazilian Cerrado with ANIMO 

 

Abstract 

 

In agriculture, a focus merely on productivity leads to unsustainable use of inputs, which in 

turn can result in negative consequences to the environment and human health. An expected 

consequence of excessive fertilizers use is the degradation of groundwater and surface water 

in and around agricultural ecosystems. The Brazilian Cerrado has suffered transformations by 

the advance of intensive agriculture during the last decades, and information about current 

field nutrient management and its environmental impact is needed to establish sustainable 

practices for this modified biome. Process-based models are a useful tool for evaluating such 

aims under future scenarios. The coupled models SWAP/ANIMO were used in this study to 

simulate leaching and plant uptake of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in a Cerrado soil of Bahia, 

Brazil, cultivated with coffee at an intensive mineral fertigation management. Main model 

parameters were measured under field conditions and ANIMO was calibrated for a scenario 

corresponding to an application with 400 kg N ha
-1

y
-1

 mineral fertilizer. The model was tested 

with independent data of NO3-N in soil solution measured in plots receiving 800 kg N ha
-1 

y
-1

. 

Statistical analysis of the modeling with ANIMO showed the simulations were in agreement 

with experimental measurements during one year of study. The measured average annual N 

plant uptake was similar to ANIMO predictions. Sensitivity analysis showed pH and 

reference temperature are critical for predictions of NO3-N leaching and concentration in soil 

solution. Model predictions of the organic cycling due to manure applications, plant roots, and 

leaf deposition were also obtained. Transformations and leaching of organic N were not 

measured experimentally and could not be considered in model validation. Besides the model 

evaluation for mineral fertilizer, we also present data needed for modeling decomposition of 

some organic fertilizers like poultry manure and coffee husks, which are widely used in 

similar agricultural systems. Obtained modeling results can give support for the 

implementation of better strategies for mineral and organic N fertilizer management for the 

Cerrado coffee production system of Bahia and alike production scenarios.

3.1 Introduction 

 

The Cerrado zone in Bahia, one of Brazil´s northeastern states, presented the highest 

coffee productivity (average of 37.5 bags per hectare) of the country over the 2009-2014 

period (CONAB, 2014). Its productivity was 22% higher than the second most productive 

region, the Cerrado of the southeastern state of Minas Gerais. Although Cerrado soils are 

notoriously infertile, the region in Bahia has several excellent qualities for modern 

agriculture. The flat land is accessible for planting, the sandy and sandy-loam soils are well 

drained, and surface and underground water sources are available for crop cultivation with 

irrigation (GASPAR; CAMPOS, 2007). Moreover, the well-defined rainy season (October-

April) and an almost rainless season from May to September is a welcome climatic feature of 

this region with respect to coffee cropping. Coffee production in the Cerrado of Bahia is only 

possible due to the combination of irrigation and fertilizing practices, however. 

Few studies evaluated the N processes occurring in the productive coffee cultivations 

of Bahia´s Cerrado and associated them to management practices. For this reason, it is 

questionable whether fertilizers have been managed efficiently and in a sustainable way in 

this region. Existing studies on the N management for coffee cultivation on Cerrado soils did 

not solve these questions. Bruno et al. (2014) studied the N efficiency uptake by mature 

coffee plants in western Bahia for different doses, concluding that a reduction from 600 to 

200 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 was possible without reducing crop productivity and decreasing the leaching 

of N to groundwater. A study by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) 

resulted in the same dose (200 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

) for a maximum coffee yield on an Oxisol in the 

central Cerrado (SANZONOWICZ et al., 2003). Neto et al. (2011) found a dose of around 

400 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1 

to yield maximum productivity of coffee plants of Bahia’s Cerrado. These 

are few achievements related to fertilization efficiency, and more studies need to be 

developed for the successful continuity of coffee cultivation in the Cerrado region and an 

efficient production system with sustainable and non-polluting farming practices.  

The use of models is an important tool for understanding water and nutrient dynamics 

in agricultural systems, to evaluate sensitivities and to suggest strategies for reducing fertilizer 

input and propose scenarios for better management. The hydrological model SWAP (VAN 

DAM et al., 2008) and the nutritional model ANIMO (GROENENDIJK et al., 2005) are both 

widely used to simulate water and nutrient dynamics. SWAP simulates the physical 

mechanisms associated with water flow, heat flow and solute transport in the soil. ANIMO 

simulates the cycles of C, N, and P in the soil, as well as greenhouse gas emissions, 



69 
 

 

emphasizing nutrient leaching together with decomposition, nitrification, denitrification, 

mineralization, immobilization, phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) soil sorption, and carbon (C) 

dynamics. Combined, SWAP and ANIMO are able to quantify nutrient losses and gains due 

to fertilization practices, water, soil and land management for various types of soils and 

different hydrological conditions, and can be applied to studies on climate change and 

agricultural management scenarios (SHEPHERD et al., 2011). Both simulation models were 

accepted by the research community on water and nutrient dynamic studies with applications 

in several places around the world and for different aims (DROOGERS et al., 2000; 

MARINOV et al., 2005; SINGH et al., 2006; RUIZ et al., 2008; GUSEV et al., 2010; 

NOORY et al., 2011; MA et al., 2011; VERMA; GUPTA; ISAAC, 2012; CRESCIMANNO; 

MORGA; VENTRELL, 2012; DE JONG VAN LIER et al., 2015). 

In this study, we performed a parameterization of ANIMO for a fertilized Cerrado 

coffee cropping scenario assessing a recommendation for sustainable fertilizer use. The model 

was calibrated and validated using data on N uptake by plants and nitrate concentration in the 

soil solution. The model was used to predict the annual N balance for several fertilizer rate 

scenarios, and results were compared to observations obtained in field experiments with adult 

coffee plants.  

 

3.2 Materials and methods 

 

3.2.1 Field data 

 

Field data used for calibration and testing are described in Bruno et al. (2011) and 

Bortolotto et al. (2011). These authors carried out an experiment from August 1, 2008, to July 

24, 2009, on a private coffee farm in Barreiras (11°46 S, 45°43’ W) in the state of Bahia, 

Brazil. The area has virtually no slope (&lt;1%) and was previously covered by Cerrado 

vegetation. The soil is classified as Typic Hapludox (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2010), has low 

natural fertility and is surrounded by remaining Cerrado ecosystem areas. Local precipitation 

ranges from 582 to 1687 mm per year according to historical data (1961-2013) of the National 

Institute of Meteorology (INMET). Wind speed, solar radiation, air temperature, and air 

humidity were used from the INMET weather station of Barreiras. Precipitation and irrigation 

were measured at the experimental field. 

 



70 

 

Coffee plants (Coffea arabica L., variety Catuaí Vermelho) were seven years old at 

the beginning of the experiment. The plant arrangement was circular, allowing irrigation and 

fertigation by a center pivot with a total irrigated area of 80 ha. Plants spacing was 3.8 m 

between lines (pivot circles) and 0.5 m between plants. In previous years, urea was applied as 

fertilizer by fertigation according to the expected crop productivity. The input of mineral N 

was of the order of 600 kg N ha
-1 

y
-1

.  

Irrigation was performed by Low Energy Precision Application (LEPA) emitters, 

which distribute the water according to the circular coffee lines, avoiding water application in 

the interrow. The operation of the pivot was continuous during the year and stopped only for 

harvest. An amount of 4 mm of water was applied every second day, and fertigation each 

fourteen days. The farmer´s practices for crop management included weed and pest control 

with pesticides, applications of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), micronutrients, lime and 

gypsum and several organic materials. 

Experimental data from Bruno et al. (2011) were assembled to analyze the  

N distribution in coffee plant compartments and to obtain an annual N balance for 

applications of four fertilizer doses, with four replicates. Sixteen plots with three plants each 

received urea at rates of 200, 400, 600 and 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. The annual amount of  

N fertilizer was partitioned for application each 14 days, over one full year, following 

farmer´s practice. The experiment was assembled in the fourth circle of the pivot (258 coffee 

trees grown as a hedge), counted from the center, which was disconnected from the farmer´s 

fertigation schedule. The experimental parcels were randomly distributed along the circle. A 

schematic representation of the experimental plots is available in Bruno et al. (2011). 

Soil solution samples were taken using soil solution extractors, which were installed 

close to the middle plant trunk only in the parcels that received 400 and 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. Soil 

solution was sampled at the 1.0 m depth, every two weeks during the second half of 2008 and 

once per month during the first half of 2009. Nitrate concentration in soil solution was 

measured by flow injection analysis.  

 

3.2.2 Models and scenarios 

 

ANIMO (GROENENDIJK et al., 2005) simulates carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus 

cycles in a one-dimensional layered soil-plant system and should be used in combination with 

a hydrological model. Commonly used in association with ANIMO, the SWAP model 

(KROES et al., 2008) simulates spatio-temporal variations of soil water content and 



71 
 

 

temperature. Nutrient transport simulation by ANIMO is governed by the general formulation 

of the mass conservation and transport differential equation (GROENENDIJK et al., 2005; 

RENAUD et al., 2006). For additional information and details in relation to the ANIMO 

model and its operation, we refer to the studies of Berghuijs-van Dijk et al. (1985), 

Groenendijk et al. (2008), Roelsma and Hendriks (2014), Stolk et al. (2011) and De Willigen 

et al. (2008). 

For simulation purposes, the growing season (year) was subdivided in two periods of 

six months: the first one from August to December 2008 and the second from January to July 

2009. Simulations referred exclusively to coffee plants, i.e., no weeds or interrow crops were 

considered. The seven-year-old coffee plantation on a sandy soil was described in the input 

files of ANIMO using data directly collected in the experimental setups together with 

scientific database information available in other published materials related to agriculture in 

the Brazilian Cerrado area. 

 

3.2.2.1 Hydrological module (SWAP) 

 

The hydrological data used for ANIMO simulations were obtained using the SWAP 

model (KROES et al., 2008) with hydraulic parameters for the soil profile down to 1 m depth, 

and these outcomes can be found in Pinto et al. (2015). Soil hydraulic parameters were 

preserved during ANIMO simulations (Table 3.1). For the deeper soil layer (1.0-2.0 m) the 

hydrological parameters were obtained by fitting the Van Genuchten (1980) equation with 

Mualem parametric restriction to data obtained from disturbed soil samples (R² = 0.92) using 

the software RETC (VAN GENUCHTEN et al., 1991). The shape parameter ? for the deeper 

soil layer was obtained by inverse modeling.

3.2.2.2 Crop and soil parameters 

 

Relevant crop (coffee) parameters are shown in Table 3.2. The relation C/N and pH 

for some Brazilian Cerrado soils and the estimations used in the present study are shown in 

Table 3.3. The estimated C/N ratio and pH of the soil in this study were comparable and close 

to values of other studies in the Cerrado. The depth of the root zone Zr (1.0 m) was 

maintained constant during the experimental year. As observed in field tests, the majority of 

roots were found close to the soil surface. The soil layer with the relative highest root 

concentration (100%) was adjusted in SWAP from soil surface until 0.6 m, decreasing 

linearly down to 1% at the maximum root zone depth (1 m). The expected cumulative  

N uptake (Up) values were obtained from data of N concentration and dry matter of the plant 

parts (leaves, branch, trunk, fruit, and litter) sampled during the year (BRUNO et al., 2011). 

The Up was obtained for each plot of the study and a mean value was calculated at the end for 

the simulations. The difference between the N accumulated in the whole plant at onset and 

end of the experiments was the expected N uptake during the experimental period. Plant 

transpiration values were obtained from SWAP simulations. The parameter ?N
max

 was 

established by calibration, to be discussed later.  

Soil temperature was obtained by a numerical approach available in the SWAP model, 

making use of soil texture data, soil water and air volume fraction, and air temperature as the 

top boundary conditions. Initial amounts of NH4-N and NO3-N in the soil solution of 

compartments as required for ANIMO simulations were considered equal to zero for both 

inorganic N forms, since no soil solution analyzes for N concentrations were made in the 

beginning of the experiment (BORTOLOTTO et al., 2013) due to the occurrence of very low 

soil water contents.

3.2.2.3 N input characterization 

 

The inputs of N in the simulated soil-plant system occur by dry and wet deposition, by 

rainfall, irrigation water, applications of fertilizers and manures, and by plant shoots (leaf 

litter) and decomposition of roots. 

The average concentrations of NH4
+
 (cwNH4) and NO3

-
 (cwNO3) in rainwater were 

obtained from studies of different parts of Brazil (Table 3.4) and used as input in the present 

simulations with ANIMO. The input of annual N dry deposition was assessed using the N wet 

deposition data predicted with ANIMO and the ratio values of the annual dry and wet 

deposition for NH4-N (IdNH4/ IwNH4) and NO3-N (IdNO3/ IwNO3) found in North and South 

America (Table 3.5). As water used for irrigation during the experiment was taken from the 

nearest by river, but concentrations of inorganic N were not measured in the irrigation water, 

we used the N concentration from streams and rivers of the Cerrado biome reported by Hunke 

et al. (2015). Although the rivers from the exact location of this research are not included in 

this dataset, an average value of these data was considered acceptable for our purpose, mainly 

because this input is low compared to fertilizer applications. 

Fertilizing was done with urea, with the addition of poultry manure and dry coffee 

husks. After applied to the soil, urea molecules in solution are mostly transformed into NH4, 

due to the action of the urease enzyme, or they percolate out of the root zone and are 

hydrolyzed afterward. Being converted exclusively to NH4 in the soil, urea can be considered 

an ammoniacal fertilizer.

Representative values for N, NH4-N, NO3-N and OM concentrations in poultry 

manure and coffee husks were obtained from reports from literature (Table 3.6). 

Characterization of input material is shown in Table 3.7. The decomposition rate constants 

(kfp and ksp) for organic fractions of manures were estimated using data published in the 

literature. The experimental data of remaining material from Augusto (2007) or organic 

matter decomposition rates from Dias et al. (2010) were used to generate the decomposition 

curves for the fast and slow reaction parts of the poultry manure. Zoca et al. (2014) obtained 

curves of coffee husk decay and their data were used to estimate kfp and ksp. Data of 

decomposition rate constants for poultry manure or coffee husks came from a single source 

due to the lack of specific information. Coffee husks were considered as 100% organic, based 

on cited studies that found only negligible NH4 and NO3 concentrations in this material (Table 

3.6).

The residues of plant roots and the litter cover (leaves) were classified as materials 

which added N to the soil. Dead plant root material (Pr) was characterized using data of root 

dry matter (RDM) obtained on day 0, 181, 265, and 356 from plants of the experimental site. 

During the experimental year, RDM maximum occurred on day 265 (10131 kg ha
-1

) and 

decreased to a lower value on day 356 (8705 kg ha
-1

) (BRUNO et al., 2011). As RDM 

increased from the beginning of the experimental analysis until day 265 we could not estimate 

the amount of dead roots added to the soil during this period. However, from day 265 on, we 

assumed the reduction in RDM until day 356 was delivered to the soil. A general rate of 

decomposition value for roots was recommended by Wu and McCechan (1998) Litter was 

parameterized with available data of N concentration and dry matter. The litter decomposition 

rate constant was estimated as the ratio between the annual mass of deposited leaves and the 

remaining leaves on the ground (OLSON, 1963). We considered a mean value for kli for all 

studied plant parcels, although the calculated values were different for the several parcels or  

N doses. Values of the decomposition rate constant for litter kli obtained from other studies 

are shown in Table 3.8, and they can be compared to the mean value found in this study.

Table 3.9 presents data related to root exudates, dissolved organic matter (DOM), 

humus and biomass, nitrification and denitrification processes. The N concentration in root 

exudates (cNex) was considered to be the same as in coffee root dry matter, and the 

decomposition rate constant kex was the recommended by Wu and McGechan (1998). The 

decomposition rate constant of the dissolved organic matter (kDOM) and of the humus and 



79 
 

 

biomass (khu), as well as the reference nitrification rate constant (knr) and the denitrification 

rate constant (kd), and the humus N concentration (cNhu) were obtained by calibration. To 

obtain the initial values of kDOM and khu we considered that DOM is rapidly decomposed and 

humus is slowly decomposed in the soil. The interval of variation for knr and kdr were those 

presented in Renaud et al. (2006), the maximum and minimum values acceptable in ANIMO 

for each parameter. For all the organic materials added to the system, we used a rate of 

assimilation a equal to 25% (WU; MCGECHAN, 1998) and mass fraction of material 

transformed directly into humus %Fhu of 75%.

3.2.2.4 Fertilizer management 

 

3.2.2.4.1 Scenarios of N doses (part 1) 

 

Scenarios characterized in this section refer to the experimental doses in the study of 

Bruno et al. (2011). Four levels of N doses were used with ANIMO: 200, 400, 600 and 

800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

, identified by M200, M400, M600, and M800 respectively. Each N-management 

scenario consisted of 27 mineral N applications during one year (one application each 14 

days).  

 



80 

 

3.2.2.4.2 Scenarios of N dose partition (part 2) 

 

To evaluate the effects of annual N doses and fertilizer partition during the year on N 

plant uptake efficiency (NUpE) (Equation 3.1) and on NO3-N leaching accumulated during 

one year, scenarios of N management were generated as described forward.  The doses of 

200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 were evaluated for the following 

frequencies of applications (dose partition): i) N application every second day (NA1/2d) ; ii) 

once a week (NA1/1w); iii) each 14 days (NA1/2w); iv) once a month (NA1/1m); v) seven times 

during the year (NA7/12m); and vi) three times during one year (NA3/12m). The models 

SWAP/ANIMO generated a total of 48 scenarios from the combinations of different N 

amounts and dose partitions during the year. 

 

3.2.2.4.3 Scenarios of precipitation amount (part 3) 

 

To evaluate the effects of annual precipitation amounts on simulations of plant N 

uptake efficiency (NUpE) (Equation 3.1) and on NO3-N leaching accumulated during one 

year, different scenarios of precipitation amounts (table 3.10) were generated and evaluated. 

The scenarios of precipitation were generated based on daily precipitation events occurred 

during the experimental period in 2008/2009. According to the wanted scenarios, we 

increased (MaP30) or reduced (AP03-13, APr10, APr20, MiP30) the amount of precipitation of 

default events of the yearly precipitation regime used for SWAP/ANIMO calibration and 

validation. For the scenarios with reduced precipitation, supplementary irrigation was 

scheduled in the SWAP module for maintaining the average soil water storage at field 

capacity (-10 kPa). For this scheme of scenarios the yearly doses of 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 

700, and 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 were evaluated with N applications each 14 days.

3.2.2.4.4 Organic inputs and volatilization 

 

The following managements were equally used for all the scenarios of simulation 

described above in part 1, part 2 and part 3 sections. 

Coffee leaf fall was simulated scheduling the addition of the litter material to the soil 

surface each 14 days, with a cumulative yearly mass of 8031.5 kg ha

. Poultry manure (2.5 

Mg ha

) and coffee husks (3.0 Mg ha

) were applied on the soil surface once on DAB = 71 

(NETO et al., 2011). The events of material inputs were scheduled in the management module 

of ANIMO accordingly to the experimental sequence. The model applications of mineral 

fertilizer were made in the artificial reservoir of the soil existing in ANIMO and the organic 

parts of the plant in the first compartment, as recommended by Renaud et al. (2006).  

The percentage of N volatilized from mineral fertilizer was estimated according to soil water 

content on the day and day after fertilizer application and adjusted in the model (Table 3.11).

3.2.3 Nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) 

   

The efficiency of N uptake (NUpE) was calculated by the Equation 3.1, which is an 

adaptation of the relation proposed by Moll, Kamprath and Jackson (1982). 

 

(N plant uptake).(% of N taken from fertilizer)

N fertilizer dose
NUpE ?    (3.1) 

 

The yearly N plant uptake was obtained by simulations with ANIMO for each dose of N 

fertilizer applied in the scenarios of management. The percentage of N taken from fertilizer is 

an average value equal to 39%, which was obtained using the 
15

N tracer in the study of Bruno 

et al. (2011). 

 

3.2.4 Model sensitivity analysis 

 

The sensitivity of ANIMO simulations to parameter variations was calculated using 

the relative partial sensitive index ? (Equation 3.2). For this analysis, a selected parameter 

was changed by 1% (?p/p=0.01) while others were maintained at default. The effect on 

annual results of each N cycle process (?V/V) were obtained and analyzed: 

 

/

     (3.2)

 

In this study a value of |?|?0.5 was interpreted as a low sensitivity of the output (the N 

process under evaluation) to the chosen parameter. Two scenarios of N management (M400 

and M800) were evaluated for parameter sensitivity analysis. The parameters analyzed by the 

index ? were chosen after a screening of sensitivity to find the most important parameters to 

be evaluated. Soil parameters (pH, Ksr, ?d, sNH4 and Tref), plant parameters (?N
max

, Up, and Ta), 

and materials and transformation process parameters (cNfr, cNsr, kfr, ksr, knr, N dose, and 

volatilization percentage) were selected for the sensitivity evaluation. The most sensitive 

parameters were in this way selected for model calibration.

 doses of mineral 

N fertilizer were used for model calibration and validation. As four independent groups of 

data were available, the calibration was performed using the experimental data of NO3-N 

concentration in soil solution measured in four parcels of three plants that received 

400 kg N ha
-1

 y

 during 2008/2009. The model simulations were validated using two 

different output variables, which were measured experimentally: 1) the NO3-N concentration 

in soil solution for plant plots receiving 800 kg N ha

 y
-1

; 2) the plant uptake after one year 

obtained in plots receiving 200, 400, 600 and 800 kg N ha

. To generate results, each 

fertilizer management (M200, M400, M600, M800) simulated with ANIMO used the same group 

of parameters established by calibration. 

Soil parameters pH, sNH4, kfr and cNfr of poultry manure, knr, kd, ?N

, khu, kDOM, cNhu, 

(ANIMO), the shape parameter ?dsl and the root density (SWAP) were adjusted during model 

calibration. Several combinations of parameters were tested according to ranges between 

maximum and minimum values for each parameter available in Renaud et al. (2006). The best 

combination of parameters was found to be ?dsl = 6.0, soil pH1 = 4.3 (surface layer) and pH2 =

3.2.6 Model evaluation 

 

Statistical analysis of the model simulations and consistency with experimental data 

was performed using the root mean square error RMSE, the index of agreement d 

(WILLMOTT, 1981) and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency NSE (NASH; SUTCLIFFE, 

1970).

where    represents the experimentally observed value with a mean of  ?,    is the model

the proximity of predicted and observed values. The index d equal to 0 indicates no agreement 

and 1 perfect agreement. NSE-values closer to 1 indicate a more efficient model. NSE-values 

below 0 indicate the average of observed values is a better predictor than the model. A full 

explicative description of these statistical functions and their use for model validation and 

calibration can also be found in Groenendijk et al. (2014).  

 

3.3 Results and discussion 

 

3.3.1 Sensitivity analysis 

 

The most influential parameters for model simulations were established by sensitivity 

analysis. The proportional effect of parameter variation on the simulations of leaching below 

1.0 m depth, plant uptake, and N transformations (nitrification, volatilization, mineralization, 

and denitrification) was evaluated using the ? index. The sensitivity analysis of ANIMO 

simulations was performed for two scenarios of N management (400 and 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

), 

and results obtained independently are shown in Tables 3.12 and 3.13.

Soil pH, Tref, Up, Ta, and knr were the most important parameters for the simulations 

with ANIMO in this study. 

The simulated N processes showed high sensitivity to specific parameters, depending 

on the N dose. Denitrification was sensitive to Ksr, and NH4-N leaching was sensitive to the 

sorption coefficient only for the N dose of 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. An increase on Ksr diminished 

the availability of NO3-N for denitrification since plant roots absorb preferentially nitrate 

from the soil surface in M800 (these results are discussed ahead). In spite of increasing Ksr, 

plant N uptake was not affected in our simulations. The increase in parameter ?N
max

 produced 

a decrease in NO3-N leaching but did not significantly change plant uptake for a dose of 

400 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. ANIMO has distinct calculation schemes for plant uptake depending on N 

soil availability. The maximum concentration factor ?N
max

 is important only when NO3-N is 

not highly available in the system and its amount is lower than plant requirements (without 

luxurious uptake). When the dose of N was 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

, a large amount of NO3-N was 

presented in the system due to ammonium nitrification and ?N
max

 did not regulate plant uptake 

or even influenced N leaching. In fact, the maximum transpiration concentration factor ?N
max

 

was not critical for our simulations with high doses of N. The expected uptake Up2 and 

transpiration Ta2 of the second period were sensitive for crop uptake, NO3-N and NH4-N 

leaching simulations when a dose of 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 was applied. However, no influence of 

these parameters on the tested N processes was found when the N dose was 400 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. 

The cumulative Ta1 was sensitive for the simulated leaching of NO3-N (M400 and M800) and 

NH4-N (M400). The input Up1 was sensitive for NO3-N leaching in both managements. When 

the expected uptake Up was increased we could predict less nutrient would be available for 

leaching. However, we could not explain why plant uptake decreased at the same time 

transpiration Ta1 increased when the inverse behavior would be expected. The reason why the 

Up2 and Ta2 sensitivity behaviors were different for the management scenarios M400 and M800 

is as well unclear. 

Plant uptake was significantly influenced by soil pH and by the small increases in the 

N dose for M400. The most important parameters for plant uptake in the management scenario 

M800 were Up2 and Ta2, and for leaching of NO3-N and NH4-N independently, and NH4-N 

nitrification, were soil pH, Tref, and knr for both management scenarios in the sensitivity 

analysis. The leaching of NO3-N and NH4-N were highly affected when the N dose was 

increased by 1% in both managements M400 and M800 as well. Comparing the sensitivity 

indexes of NH4-N leaching in the table 3.12 with the results in table 3.13, different values of ? 

were found when the annual dose was 400 or 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-
1.The leaching of NH4-N was 



88 

 

affected by several parameters when the N dose was the higher. The processes of Norg 

mineralization, Norg leaching, and NO3-N denitrification were largely influenced by soil pH 

and Tref, and their sensitivities to the tested parameters were similar for both doses.  

Soil pH strongly affected the N processes simulated in this study. Simulated results of 

NH4-N nitrification, NO3-N leaching, and Norg mineralization increased around 5% for a soil 

surface pH increase of 1% (Table 3.12). Leaching of NH4-N was highly affected (-11%) by 

soil pH increase as shown by the sensitivity analysis of the scenario with N dose 

800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 (Table 3.13). The observed high influence of soil pH on the simulations is 

strongly related to the high amounts of fertilizer and rate of nitrification occurring in this 

system. The NH4-N nitrification is regulated by environmental factors and depends on soil 

moisture, temperature, aeration and soil pH. An exponential effect of soil pH on nitrification 

is adopted in ANIMO (RENAUD et al., 2006). The fact that soil pH was characterized for 

only three soil layers (Table 3.2) and an average value was accounted for each layer could 

also be determinant for the analysis of the presented results. Time variation of soil pH was 

desirable for the simulations, but this is still a missing behavior in the model. For fertilized 

agricultural systems, soil pH variations during time are expected to exist. Results in the 

literature showed soil pH can vary on long-term (SCHRODER et al., 2011) and short-term 

(TONG; XU, 2012) due to fertilizer reactions on soil and induced nitrification, or due to 

additions of agricultural products for improvement of soil quality. For a more realistic 

modeling of highly fertilized agricultural systems and a best estimative of N processes, we 

suggest ANIMO to have soil pH revised as being variable in time and influenced by 

processes, plants, and input materials. 

The simulated N losses by volatilization were not affected by the parameters evaluated 

in table 3.12 and 3.13, but only by the small variations of the N dose (resulting in ?=2.16, for 

M400, and ?=0.71, for M800). The soil and material parameters (p1, p2, ?d1, Ksr, C/N, cNex, cNhu, 

cDOM, cNsr of poultry manure and coffee husks, and ksr and kfr of coffee husks, and ksr of 

poultry manure, kex, kDOM, khu and kd) had very low or almost no influence on N simulations. 

The N concentration in manures did not influence the N balance. These weak effects of 

manures on simulation results can be explained by the low amount of poultry manure and 

coffee husks used in the agricultural management system and by the slow rate  

 

  



89 
 

 

of decomposition of these materials, and consequently low amount of N input due to organic 

fertilizers in this system. A similar low sensitivity occurred for irrigation, natural wet, and dry 

N input since corresponding amounts of nutrients were very low compared to the mineral 

fertilizers.

ANIMO requires initial values for the inorganic fractions NH4

 and organic 

fractions of the materials added, including mineral fertilizers. The amount of N available as 

urea was around 80% converted into NH4. Uncertainties like whether the urea fertilizer should 

be either understood as a totally ammoniacal fertilizer or adjusted with nitrate/ammonium 

percentages as a result of the calibration may exist in such modeling. Although urea-N 

converts rapidly to NH4 in soil, to consider a total conversion of urea-N into ammonium prior 

to application in the soil of simulations with ANIMO may be a gross approximation of reality. 

Other processes in the field might affect this fertilizer before its conversion into ammonium, 

for instance, leaching and runoff, and a distinct scenario of the N cycle in the simulations 

might happen compared to the real field system. Besides dividing them into forms of N, an 

option for characterizing the mineral N fertilizers would improve the simulation of chemical 



90 

 

reactions of mineral fertilizers in the soil by ANIMO. The adopted features of urea in this 

study were obtained based on a slow reaction of the fertilizer in the soil and as a result of 

model calibration. Kaufmann et al. (2014), for instance, described urea as mostly being 

converted to NO3 in ANIMO simulations but did not give a specific reason for this 

consideration. 

No differences in added organic N, like amounts of poultry manure, coffee husk, 

discarded coffee roots and plant litter were introduced in the simulated scenarios. Poultry 

manure was the only organic material containing NH4-N and NO3-N. Due to its dependence 

on animal management and added litter (for poultry litter), variations in contents and 

composition of organic N in poultry manure are common. For that reason, this study 

presented scientific data related to poultry manure analyzed by some studies from different 

locations in Brazil (Table 3.6). Organic compounds and plant parts together showed to be 

great sources of organic N for the system. As presented ahead, the organic N inputs due to 

manures and plant litter were an important source of NH4 since they were linked to the 

mineralization process. 

The estimated N wet deposition was of the same order of magnitude as reported by 

Araujo (2015) for southeast Bahia, 2.7 kg ha

 (NH4-N and NO3-N). The average inorganic 

N concentration assumed for irrigation water was comparable to values found by Lucio 

(2010), who obtained concentrations of NO3-N between 2.0?10

, were 

found by Santos et al. (2013) in the Catolé River, in the southeast region of Bahia.  

 

3.3.3 Calibration and validation 

 

The temporal evolutions of the NO3-N concentration at 1 m depth for calibration 

(M400) and validation (M800) are shown in Figure 3.1. The calibration curve (Figure 3.1a) 

showed less variability than the experimental observations but represented the cumulative 

behavior of soil NO3-N until the end of the period. During the first 100 days of simulation, the 

concentration of NO3-N increased very slowly, in agreement to the dry season (Figure 2.2). 

During this period, the NO3-N concentration in the soil could not be measured experimentally 

due to the very dry soil condition. A visual examination of the validation curve (Figure 3.1b) 

show it to represent well the experimental data, although the simulated curve underestimates 

some observed values and did not reach the high levels observed on days 190 and 263, in the 



91 
 

 

wet period. The concentration of NO3-N in the soil decreased during the period between days 

291 and 321 for both the calibration and the validation scenario, but this did not show up in 

the simulation results. This decline of nitrate concentration in the soil solution may be 

associated to higher plant absorption. According to Bruno et al. (2011), coffee fruit N 

recovery started on day 181 and continued until day 356, this period being the most 

recommended for N application. However, these peak demands for N by plants were not 

simulated in ANIMO and might be associated to the period in which both calibration and 

validation curves did not follow exactly the experimental results. The choice for zero initial 

concentrations of NO3-N and NH4-N in soil solution lead to acceptable results since the first 

measurements agreed very well with simulations (Figure 3.1).  

 

Figure 3.1 – Simulated and experimental daily concentrations of NO3-N at the 1 m soil depth 

as a function of days after the beginning of experiments (DAB), during the experimental year 

in the (a) calibration with scenario M400 and (b) validation with scenario M800 

 

  



92 

 

To quantitatively evaluate the model outcomes, simulated concentrations of NO3-N 

between 0.1 m and 1.4 m depths were statistically compared to the experimental values at 

1.0 m (Table 3.15). RMSE and d index for the calibration simulations did not vary 

considerably in the soil region between 0.8 m and 1.0 m, and statistical results for 1.0 m 

indicated an accurate simulation and calibration (GROENENDIJK et al., 2014). The 

simulations of NO3-N at 1.0 m depth for validation were of medium quality as revealed by 

NSE values but of good quality according to RMSE and d index. In relation to RMSE, both 

the calibration and the validation showed relatively low values at 1.0 m depth. Deviations on 

the validation curve were mainly caused by NO3-N concentrations measured on days 190, 263 

and 321. When these outliers were eliminated from validation, results were NSE = 0.90 and 

index d = 0.93 at 1.0 m depth. Different scenarios for the initial NO3-N and NH4-N 

concentration in soil solution were evaluated also accounting for the output values of these 

inorganic forms simulated in soil solution after one year of M200, M400, and M600. After 

evaluating the statistical parameters, we found the accordance between experimental and 

simulated amounts of NO3-N in the soil at 1.0 m depth would be lower than the original (zero 

concentrations) for each of those tested scenarios.  

An important point to be taken into consideration is that the available experimental 

data are average of several plots. The experimental values of NO3-N concentrations shown in 

Figure 3.1 were obtained from composite soil water samples taken from four replicates of 

experimental parcels of M400 (calibration) and of M800 (validation). The calibration and 

validation of ANIMO simulations relied on a few NO3-N concentration measurements for the 

statistical analysis here presented.

3.3.4 Scenarios of N doses (Part 1) 

 

Simulated annual N plant uptake was compared with experimental N amount in the 

whole plant from Bruno et al. (2014) (Figure 3.2). For N applications of 400, 600, and 

800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

, simulated results of annual N uptake were within the experimental error 

intervals (Figure 3.2). ANIMO formulations used for N uptake modeling performed well for 

the highly N available scenarios in this study, similar to conclusions by Wolf et al. (2005). 

For the 200 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 scenario, however, simulated average N uptake was lower than 

observed values and without the error interval. This discrepancy between model prediction 

and observation for M200 is possibly explained by other mechanisms for nutrient absorption 

not accounted for by ANIMO. Before the experiment, the coffee plants used for this study 

were grown for seven years under a high N management (600 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

). Plants were 

therefore used to high amounts of fertilizer and one year receiving lower doses would not be 

enough to change their habit. Thus, plants should stimulate mechanisms for continuing at high 

uptake rates. 



94 

 

 

Figure 3.2 – Simulated and observed cumulative N plant uptake for scenarios M200, M400, M600 and 

M800 during 2008/2009. The dotted line represents the expected N uptake by plants (Up) used for 

simulations with all scenarios 

 

 

The total N taken up by plants in ANIMO simulations can be divided into NO3-N or 

NH4-N preferences, and also in relation to the main region of nutrient absorption in the soil. 

For the M200 scenario, uptake was 41% NO3-N and 59% NH4-N. For the M400, M600 and M800 

scenarios, NO3-N uptake was predominant (52, 63 and 86% respectively). The highest plant 

preference for NO3-N occurred precisely for the highest dose of N (800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

). The 

high amount of N expected to be taken up by plants (Up) caused the plant to take up both 

forms of N when the nutrient was available in relatively low doses, but preferentially NO3 

when supply was ample. In relation to distribution over depth, the first 0.1 m of soil provided 

39% (M200), 36% (M400), 32% (M600) and 28% (M800) of the total NO3-N, and 49% (M200), 46 

% (M400), 42% (M600) and 29% (M800) of the total NH4-N. The surface layer was the main 

pool of N for plants in this system when the fertilizer doses were less than 600 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. 

For the N dose of 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

, the N uptake was mostly of NO3-N and absorbed from 

the depths between 0.1 and 1.0 m.  

Table 3.16 presents the annual inputs of inorganic N, conversions of NH4-N by 

nitrification, and losses by leaching, volatilization, and denitrification down to 1.0 m depth.

The annual NH4-N input due to the mineralization of organic substances in the system 

was 130 kg ha

formation by 29 kg ha

The amounts of NO3-N lost by leaching (Table 3.16) represented 8.6% (M200), 10.6% 

(M400), 15.0% (M600) and 22.0% (M800) of the total inorganic N input. In increasing order of 

N-dose, the fractions of NH4-N leached in relation to N input were 2.4%, 2.0%, 2.4%, and 

2.2%. Simulated NO3-N leaching was compared to experimental results obtained by 

Bortolotto et al. (2013) for the same experimental coffee growing area. Their results for NO3-

N leaching were 24.2 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 (at 400 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

) and 153 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 (at 

800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

), corresponding to 42% (M400) and 74% (M800) of the ANIMO simulated 

values. An exact agreement between the results of both models, however, was not expected, 

due to the differences in the hydrological cycle simulated by SWAP (PINTO et al., 2015) and 

using a sequential water balance as in Bortolotto et al. (2013). In addition, we used ANIMO 

to simulate the cumulative N leaching amount for a one year period, differently from the cited 

study with results obtained during a nine-month period.  

The ANIMO prediction of annual NO3-N leaching expressed per millimeter of rainfall 

and irrigation was 26 g ha
-1

 mm
-1

 for M400, which is comparable to values found in other 

studies. Cannavo et al. (2013) obtained a NO3-N leaching of 59 g ha
-1

 per millimeter of 

rainfall at the 1.2 m depth in a study with unshaded coffee plants fertilized with 250 kg N ha
-1

 

y

. Harmand et al. (2007) determined a NO3-N leaching of 43 g ha
-1

 per millimeter of rainfall 

in coffee plants fertilized with 180 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. Considering NO3-N leaching depends on soil 

properties, plant, and nutrient management, values will vary from one location to another. 



96 

 

However, the simulated amounts of NO3-N leaching in the studied coffee plantation of 

western Bahia were compatible to the other cultivation areas.  

The temporal variation of NO3-N in the soil profile, coupled to precipitation, 

irrigation, fertigation (M400) and manure events, is presented in Figure 3.3. In the dry period 

of the year, due to the fertilizer applications and low soil moisture, the NO3-N was highly 

concentrated in soil layer between surface and 0.3m depth. Water from isolated rain events 

increased the leaching amount during the dry period and NO3-N concentration decreased in 

the soil surface layer. During the wet period NO3-N concentration in soil solution of deeper 

layers increased. At the end of the simulated period, with fewer rain events, the NO3-N 

concentration in the soil surface increased, as well as in the soil profile below 0.6 m. The N 

leaching due to fertigation can be identified in the contour graph of Figure 3.3 (M400) and 

Figure 3.4 (M800). Due to the characteristics of the sandy soil, irrigation and peak rain events, 

the NO3-N accumulated below the layer with the highest root concentration from 0-0.6 m 

depth at the end of the year. A large difference exists in NO3-N soil concentration of Figure 

3.3 compared to Figure 3.4 due to the amount of N applied in the managements.

The existence of NH4-N leaching in this coffee plantation is an important fact 

associated with the modeling/validation. Bortolotto et al. (2013) considered the NO3-N 

leaching in this same area as being the total N leaching since they did not detect NH4-N 

concentrations in their soil solution samples. However, for all studied scenarios, NH4-N was 

predicted to be present in detectable concentrations (&gt; 25 µg L
-1

) in the soil solution and to be 

transported by drainage (Table 3.16). Therefore, we simulated the effect of increased rates of 

nitrification and volatilization on NH4 present in the soil. When the nitrification rate knr was 

increased to the highest value allowed by ANIMO (500 y
-1

), the NH4-N leaching was still 

present (8.6 kg ha
-1

 y
-1

 for M400). At the same time, increasing the nitrification rate affected 

modeling accuracy at 1.0 m depth (d = 0.79 and NSE = 0.41). In a next scenario, the 

volatilization of NH3 was increased to 50% of applications during dry periods, resulting in a 

NH4-N leaching of 9.8 kg ha
-1

 y
-1

 in M400 (d = 0.80 and NSE = 0.35 for NO3-N concentration 

prediction at 1.0 m depth). These results showed NH4-N leaching is predicted even under very 

high levels of nitrification and volatilization. The undetected traces of NH4-N in soil samples 

can be a result of nitrification along the period of time between field sampling and laboratory 

analysis, since there was a considerable distance between both locations.  



98 

 

We suggest NH4-N can be found in the soil solution or leachate in the experimental site as 

shown by simulations. 

Emissions of N2O simulated by ANIMO resulted to be relatively high (table 3.16) 

when compared to results on cultivated or native Cerrado (METAY et al., 2007; CRUVINEL 

et al., 2007; CARVALHO et al., 2006). Denitrification is present generally in flooded terrains 

or due to the presence of anoxic microsites, common in well-drained soils under high-

intensity irrigation like in the present study. Moreover, when the litter cover is predominant, 

soil moisture is conserved and the provision of C increased, contributing to the intensification 

of denitrification. Soils under irrigated coffee cultivation are prone to denitrification, although 

this may not be the main N loss process in this system.  

For all scenarios, prediction of volatilization was low compared to the N inputs (Table 

3.16). During the simulations, only 37% of the fertilizer application events had the highest 

losses of NH4-N considered by volatilization (10% of N in each application). The low rates of 

volatilization during the year are partly justified since coffee plants received the urea in 

solution by fertigation and most of these events (63%) were followed by irrigation or rainfall, 

processes which minimize losses of N by volatilization (JANTALIA et al., 2012; HOLCOMB 

et al., 2011). Nevertheless, as the volatilization simulations could not be validated 

experimentally, the obtained values of NH4-N losses by this process are uncertain and results 

could diverge from experimental measurements. For that reason, we simulated the N balance 

with ANIMO considering 1% of N input was volatilized from fertilizer when rain/irrigation 

happened on the same day of application, 10% when the rain/irrigation happened on the next 

day of fertilizer application, and 30% when fertilizer application was not followed by 

rain/irrigation events, or during the dry period of the year. When the cited volatilization 

percentages were considered, the simulated annual losses of N by volatilization resulted 20.0

). When the volatilization percentages were 

increased the values of N balance components did not chance significantly and NO3-N 

concentrations in soil solution 1m depth simulated with ANIMO could be validated, although 

statistical indexes values (d = 0.78, NSE = 0.33) decreased in relation to those in table 3.15. 

We consider the results of annual volatilization obtained from the cited volatilization 

percentages 1%, 10% and 30% of N doses are the upper limits for our study area, since the 

statistical indexes values d and NSE indicated a low quality of simulations when these 

percentages were higher.  We conclude that, for the conditions described in this study, the 

amounts of volatilization between 7.0 and 20.0 kg ha

 (200 kg

) are representative of the studied coffee cultivation area. 

As volatilization, denitrification and NH4-N leaching were not measured 

experimentally, the validation of model predictions for these processes, unfortunately, could 

not be performed. Steenvoorden et al. (1997) stated this is a problem for model performance 

evaluation, since nitrate leaching or NO3-N concentration can be calculated precisely and 

confirmed by validation for different values or combinations of amounts of volatilization, 

denitrification, and mineralization. Field measurements are highly recommended then to 

confirm the rates of the simulated processes (Table 3.16) with ANIMO for this coffee 

cultivation system. 

As presented here, the model ANIMO was calibrated and validated with the 

experimental results obtained in a coffee plantation during one year. With these previous 

results and data assembled, the scenarios of fertilizer and crop management, as well as climate 

change predictions, can be generated with the association SWAP/ANIMO. The obtained 

results of simulated N processes can serve as support for other studies and perhaps be useful 

in guiding research towards the most important topics on this N cycle that is still waiting to be 

better evaluated and estimated experimentally. 

 

3.3.5 Scenarios of N dose partition (Part 2) 

 

Figures 3.4 and 3.5 show the results of N efficiency uptake (NUpE) and NO3-N 

leaching, respectively, obtained from simulations of scenarios with different N application 

frequencies and N doses.  

The NUpE descreased approximately in the same proportion that the N dose increased 

for all the scenarios of N application frequency (Figures 3.4). For each of the selected 

scenarios of N application frequency, the reduced proportion in NUpE when dose increased 

from 200 to 300 kg N ha
-1 

y
-1 

was higher than NUpE decrease when dose increased from 300 

to 400 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 or in any other case. For a selected N dose, differences in NUpE values 

were not significant between fertilizer application frequency scenarios simulated with 

ANIMO (Figure 3.4). 

For each scenario of N application frequency, increases in N dose significantly 

increased NO3-N leaching (Figures 3.5). Reducing the frequency of N application to less than 

once each 14 days (NA1/2w) to seven or three times during the year showed to increase the 

NO3-N leaching when comparing results of the same N dose. For each evaluated N dose, there 



100 

 

were almost no differences in the results of NO3-N leaching obtained from the scenarios of N 

application NA1/2d, NA1/1w, and NA1/2w (Figure 3.5). The lowest value of NO3-N leaching 

resulted from the simulation of the scenario with 200 kg ha
-1

 y
-1

 applied every second day 

(NA1/2d). 

We consider an efficient N management should provide at least 50% of NUpE and 

NO3-N leaching less than 15% of the total N dose. Evaluations of NUpE and NO3-N leaching 

values resulted from the scenarios of N application frequency and N doses simulated with 

ANIMO suggested the efficient managements are those with dose partition at least once every 

14 days and N doses equal or less than 300 kg ha

3.3.6 Scenarios of precipitation amount (Part 3) 

 

Figures 3.6 and 3.7, respectively, show the results of N efficiency uptake (NUpE) and 

NO3-N leaching obtained from the simulations of scenarios with different amounts of 

precipitation and N doses applied in the same frequency during the year (each 14 days). 

Variations in annual precipitation did not influence plant NUpE obtained from the 

simulations of scenarios with ANIMO (Figure 3.6). For the same N dose, results of NUpE 

obtained from the scenario Pdefaut compared to other scenarios with increased or reduced 

precipitation amount did not differ significantly. 

Leaching of NO3-N was very influenced by the variations in the cumulative amount of 

precipitation (Figure 3.7). Results of NO3-N leaching obtained from simulations of scenarios 

AP03-13, APr10, and APr20 with N doses of 200, 300 and 400 kg ha
-1

 y
-1

 were very close 

accordingly to ANIMO simulations. Comparing values of NO3-N leaching resulted from the 

scenario with the average annual precipitation of Barreiras (AP03-13) with the scenario of the 

historical annual maximum precipitation (MaP30), the precipitation increase between these 

scenarios were responsible for 63% and 67% of NO3-N leaching increase for the N doses 300 

and 600 kg ha
-1

 y
-1

, respectively. These results showed the increase in N dose did not affect 

substantially the NO3-N leaching when the annual precipitation amount was increased. When 

the extreme event historical annual minimum precipitation was evaluated with ANIMO, the 

values of NO3-N leaching did not vary significantly between N doses of 200, 300, 400 and 

500 kg ha
-1

 y

.

calculated in kilograms of N for a pivot circle area of 100 ha during one experimental year 

(Figure 3.8). The relation between the total N losses (leaching, volatilization, and 

denitrification added up) with N dose amounts was significant for one pivot circle unit, since 

increasing N dose from 200 to 300 kg N ha

 increased total N losses by 1550 kg y

from 300 to 400 kg N ha

. Reducing N doses from

, the fractions associated to coffee plants uptake and the wasted fractions by 

leaching, volatilization and denitrification, in one pivot circle (100 ha) during one year 

(Figure 3.9). Since fertilizer prices in Brazil diverge between regions, can also vary 

accordingly to the U$/R$ rate, we used the urea prices obtained by different studies in the 

period of 2014/2015. The urea (raw material, 45% N) prices were the following: i) average of 

R$ 1,537.00/t from Jully to September 2015, according to “Federação de Agricultura e 

Pecuária de Goiás – FAEG” (FAEG, 2015); ii) between R$ 1,042.52/t and R$ 1,404.29/t in 

September 2015, according to ARGUS (ARGUS, 2015); iii) average of R$ 1,353.50/t in 

April/March 2015, according to “Centro de Estudos Avançados em Economia Aplicada” 

(CEPEA, 2015); iv) and average of R$ 800.00/t in the period of 2014-2015, according to 

World Bank data (WORLD BANK, 2015). The average price of urea obtained from cited data 

was R$ 1,227.00/t (or R$ 1.23/kg), which was converted to kilograms of N resulting in R$ 

2.73/kg N. Figure 3.9 presents the scenarios of average costs by employing the N doses of

and farmers dose of 600 kg ha

(in 2008/2009) with urea prices of 

2014/2015. A pivot circle managed with high doses of N fertilizer demands high investments, 

by which a large quantity is wasted due to the N losses. Based on simulations of fertilizer 

plant uptake (39% of total plant uptake), total N leaching and losses by volatilization and 

denitrification with ANIMO model, the costs with fertilizer for the coffee cultivation in 

Cerrado would be significantly reduced by employing N doses between 200 and 300 kg ha

. These outcomes showed the average economic savings that farmers would have reducing 

the amounts of fertilizer applications.

3.4 Final considerations 

 

A field-scale application of the SWAP/ANIMO model to a coffee plantation scenario 

for the Brazilian Cerrado has been developed and the results of modeling were presented. The 

model ANIMO was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis and the most important parameters for 

the intensively fertilized system were obtained. For a soil-plant system like this, in which no 

other source of N besides urea is significant, emphasis should be given to soil pH and soil 

temperature of reference (Tref). These parameters were especially sensitive for the simulations 

of the annual N balances when mineral fertilizer was applied at the rate of 400 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 

and 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

. The soil pH was the most sensitive modeling parameter. A 1% increase 

of pH made NO3-N leaching increase almost 3% for both M400 and M800. Although the 

detailed processes simulated by ANIMO require several input parameters, in the evaluated 

scenarios not all of them were sensitive for modeling. The modeling with ANIMO can be 

simpler and more objective when the most sensitive parameters are established. For instance, 

for an agricultural system managed only with organic manures, the N concentration in the 

organic fractions of materials (cNfp and cNsp) and the decomposition rate constants (kfp and ksp) 

become the most important parameters to be characterized for use in ANIMO. The cited 

parameters soil pH and Tref should be taken into account anyway and be well adjusted 

independently of the study conditions.  

Some ANIMO parameters were taken from literature and can be seen as potential 

sources for new investigations. Future studies should consider, for instance, the maximum 

transpiration stream concentration factor ?N
max

 that is frequently adopted as a unique value 

independently of the soil-plant system. A description of ?N
max

 behavior for ordinary crops 

would be welcome for ANIMO applications in systems with limited soil nitrogen availability. 

Some parameters of material characterization like the decomposition rate constant (k) are 

difficult to find, and for that reason we summarize important information related to poultry 

manure and coffee husks. With this information, we expect to benefit other investigations 

related to coffee cultivation. 

This study also showed the N processes simulated by ANIMO have a distinct 

sensitivity behavior to the input parameters of soil, plant, and materials depending on the 

annual N dose. Plant uptake, leaching of NO3-N and NH4-N, and nitrification were affected 

differently by the same parameters in M400 and M800 and sometimes were sensitive to a certain 

parameter only for a specific N dose. These results challenged our purposes of using ANIMO 



110 

 

for studying the N cycle processes establishing a unique set of parameters representative of 

the system under several N dose scenarios.  

The model ANIMO was calibrated and validated for the coffee plantation of Cerrado 

and simulations were evaluated employing the statistical parameters RMSE, NSE and d index. 

The model accurately predicted the majority of daily NO3-N concentrations in soil solution at 

1.0 m depth during validation, resulting RMSE = 7.3?10
-3

 kg m

, NSE = 0.45 and index d = 

0.80. The simulated annual N plant uptake values for doses of 400 kg N ha

 y
-1

 (calibration) 

and 800 kg N ha
-1

 y
-1

 (validation) were similar to the average values obtained by field 

experiments. We conclude that the one-dimensional process-based model ANIMO was able to 

describe satisfactorily the average N cycle of the evaluated soil-plant system.  

From the presented outcomes, we are encouraged to propose improvements for the 

model ANIMO that could make simulations more realistic or better describing fertigated 

agricultural systems. Firstly, the inorganic fertilizer characterization should be better 

described to simulate the soil chemical reactions of nitrogen fertilizers. The upper boundary 

conditions could be enhanced as well, considering the detailed input of mineral nitrogen by 

irrigation (fertigation) as an option in the management file of ANIMO. The inclusion of other 

process occurring in the above ground system, e.g. N leaf interception, would be desirable in 

this case. Secondly, ANIMO’s simple consideration of the soil pH as time independent can be 

determinant under such conditions. Because soil pH can be affected by fertilizer input and 

subsequently influence another process like nitrification, we consider including the soil pH 

time variability as a model parameter would benefit model performance.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

 

The hypotheses and objectives of this work were presented in section 1. In section 2 

the study “Deep drainage modeling for a fertigated coffee plantation in the Brazilian Cerrado” 

showed the results of SWAP calibration and comparison of water balance outcomes with a 

conventional model, the Climatologic Water Balance. The sensitivity of water balance components to 

input parameters of soil and plant were obtained, and the potential of SWAP for generating scenarios 

of irrigation was evaluated.  

Drainage simulated by SWAP showed to be highly sensitive to the van Genuchten equation 

parameter n and Mualem equation parameter ?, and by plant crop factor Kc.  

Results of annual water balance simulated by SWAP and calculated by CWB were equal, but 

these models showed to predict differently monthly drainage. SWAP is a robust model, which was 

also validated in several studies and conditions. We expect the drainage results obtained from this 

process-based model to be more realistic than the CWB, which is simpler in its formulation. 

Irrigation scenarios simulated with SWAP for the experimental year showed to be 

efficient in water use and coffee productivity when longer intervals of irrigation were used. 

According to this analysis, adopting an irrigation interval of 15 days and yearly water amount 

between 650 and 750 mm could be an option for better management compared to the farmer’s 

scenario.  Results of water productivity, plant productivity, and deep drainage indicated the 

farmer’s management practices could be improved, minimizing loss of water by drainage and 

at the same time increasing coffee production.  

In section 3 the study “Modeling nitrogen dynamics in a fertigated coffee plantation in the 

Brazilian cerrado with ANIMO” showed the simulations results of N dynamics due to natural entries 

and fertigation management in the studied coffee cultivation of Cerrado. The combinations of models 

SWAP/ANIMO was calibrated and validated with data of NO3-N concentrations in soil solution 

obtained experimentally. The sensitivity of N processes simulated with ANIMO to the input 

parameters was evaluated. The potential of SWAP/ANIMO for generating scenarios of N fertilizer 

application were evaluated in this section. 

ANIMO was calibrated and validated for the coffee plantation of Cerrado and 

simulations were evaluated employing the statistical parameters RMSE, NSE and d index. 

The model accurately predicted the majority of daily NO3-N concentrations in soil solution at 

the 1.0 m depth during validation, which was confirmed by the obtained ranking of statistical 

index values. The simulated annual N plant uptake was close and within the uncertainty 

interval of the experimental value available in the validation scenario. Evaluations of NUpE 

and NO3-N leaching results from the scenarios of N application frequency and N doses

simulated with ANIMO suggested the most efficient managements are those with dose 

partition at least once every 14 days and N doses equal or less than 300 kg ha

We conclude that the combination of one-dimensional process-based models 

SWAP/ANIMO was able to describe satisfactorily the average N cycle of the evaluated soil-

plant system of Cerrado in Bahia, Brazil.

Modeling  in agriculture  represents an important  tool to understand  processes as  water and  nutrient

losses  by  drainage,  or  to test different  conditions  and  scenarios  of soil  and  crop  management.  Among  the

existing  computational models to describe hydrological  processes, SWAP  (Soil,  Water,  Atmosphere and

Plant  model)  has  been  successfully  used  under  several conditions.  This model  was originally  developed  to

simulate  short  cycle crops and  its use  also  to cover  longer cycles,  e.g.  perennial crops,  is a  new application.

This  report shows  a SWAP  application  to a  mature  coffee crop  over one-production  cycle,  focusing on

deep  drainage  losses  in a  typical  soil–plant–atmosphere  system of the  Brazilian  savanna  (Cerrado).  The

estimated  annual  deep drainage  Q =  1019  mm obtained  by SWAP was within  99% of the  value  determined

by  the  climatologic  water balance  of 1010 mm. Monthly  results of SWAP  for  Q  compared  to  the  estimative

using  the  climatological  method  presented a determination  coefficient of 0.77.  A  variety of coffee  ferti-

gation  scenarios  were simulated  using  SWAP  and  compared  to farmer’s management  scenario,  leading

to  the  conclusion that  larger  irrigation  intervals  result  in lower Q  losses,  better  water productivity  and

higher  crop  yield.

1. Introduction

The savanna ecoregion (Cerrado) prevails in  central Brazil, also

reaching the northeast part of the country and including part of

the state of Bahia. The savanna domain in Bahia is  highly suit-

able for irrigated agriculture due to the great availability of surface

and underground water resources. According to Brazil’s National

Grain Supply Company (CONAB), western Bahia is an important

food (grain) provider and holds, for example, the highest coffee

yield under savanna conditions in the country. However, there are

some concerns in respect to the modern agriculture practiced in

this producer region. Due to the ineffective land management dur-

ing the last decades, the irrigated farms concentrated at specific

areas and, therefore, conflicts over water use already took place

in western Bahia (Lima, 2011). At the same time, management

practices applied by farmers are not sustainable in terms of fertil-

izer and water usage, especially due to  the lack of scientific studies

that support their decisions (Bruno et al., 2011).

Numerical modeling applied to  agriculture is a useful tool to

simulate biophysical processes and can be used to obtain short-

term results and future predictions under defined scenarios. The

information generated is helpful for establishing a  more sustainable

agriculture as well as supporting strategies for the mitigation of

pollution, named by Strauch et al. (2013) as the “Best Management

Practices”. The hydrological model SWAP (Soil, Water, Atmosphere

and Plant) is one of the existing algorithms used worldwide for a

variety of soils, crops and climatic conditions (Chirico et al., 2013;

Crescimanno et al., 2012; Eitzinger et al., 2004; Kamble et al., 2013;

Ma et al., 2011; Noory et al., 2011). The model has shown consis-

tent results when applied to maize crops in  sub-tropical climates

(Pinheiro et al., 2013) and to soybeans and common beans in  tropi-

cal climates (Scorza Junior et al., 2010; Durigon et al., 2012). SWAP

was successfully validated already under several climatic and envi-

ronmental conditions as cited Ines et al. (2006). More recent studies
