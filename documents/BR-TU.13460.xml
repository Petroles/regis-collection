ABSTRACT 
 
Egeria densa is a submerged aquatic macrophyte which, in Brazil, causes problems specially for electric energy 
generation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the photosynthetic rate of E. densa in two rivers (Aguapeú and 
Mambu) with different limnological features, both located  in the Itanhaém River Basin. This species is abundant in 
both rivers without causing damages to their multiple uses. Photosynthetic rates were analysed in February, May, 
August and November 1998 and limnological variables of the water and sediment were also measured. The highest 
value of gross photosynthesis (GP) was detected in May (10.06 in Aguapeú and 6.10 mgO2/gDW/h in Mambu), when 
under-water photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) was also high (1,126.7 and 895.8 µmol/m/s, respectively). GP, 
total phosphorous, total CO2 and PAR were always higher in Aguapeú River.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Aquatic macrophytes are considered to be one of 
the main primary producers in shallow water 
ecosystems; they show a great capacity to adapt to 
changing environmental conditions and, as a 
consequence, show a great ecological amplitude 
(Camargo and Esteves, 1995; Esteves, 1998). 
These characteristics, together with modifications 
of the environment caused by man, result in an 
undesirable growth of several species in some 
aquatic ecosystems. 
The excessive growth of aquatic macrophytes is a 
result of human activities, which create favourable 
conditions for their growth (Seshavatharam, 1990). 
According to Madsen (1998), the nonnative 
submerged species which cause most problems 

(affecting navigation, hydroelectric power 
generation, water supply, recreation and flood 
control) in the United States are Hydrilla 
verticillata (L.f.) Royle, Myriophyllum spicatum 
L. and Egeria densa Planch, known as Brazilian 
elodea. These three species have biological and 
physiological  characteristics  that  enable  them to 
exploit the aquatic environment in an opportunistic 
way, growing and reproducing in sub-optimal 
conditions, even when in competition with other 
species (Spencer and Bowes, 1990). 
For the management of submerged species, it is 
important to know about the conditions that favour 
and/or limit their growth, and one way is to 
estimate the photosynthetic rate. The 
photosynthesis and respiration rates of submerged 
macrophytes are directly related to temperature

and light (Menendez and Peñuelas, 1993; 
Menendez and Sanches, 1998), as well as to 
nutrient availability, including dissolved carbon 
and oxygen (Sand-Jensen, 1989; Madsen and 
Sand-Jensen, 1994; Feijoó et al., 1996; Madsen et 
al., 1998). These variables can affect the 
photosynthetic characteristics of the plant, both 
seasonally (e.g. light and temperature) and diurnally 
(e.g. O2 and CO2), and as such they can have 
combined effects in modifying the photosynthetic 
characteristics (Sand-Jensen, 1989). 
E. densa and Egeria najas Planch. are two 
submerged macrophyte species that have been 
growing   abundantly in some of the Brazilian 
reservoirs, and so having adverse effects on the 
hydroelectric power generation (Thomas et al., 
1999). However, studies about limnological 
features that influence their growth and 
photosynthetic rates are few, especially, in their 
native habitats.  
The objective of this study was to measure the 
photosynthetic rates of E. densa and to determine 
the main limnological variables involved in the 
control of the photosynthesis and respiration of 
this species. 
 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
The measurements of photosynthesis, respiration 
and of the physicochemical characteristics of the 
water and sediment were taken in quarterly 
intervals during 1998: February (summer), May 
(autumn), August (winter) and November (spring). 
The photosynthetic rate was measured in sites 
where E. densa occurred in both rivers using water 
from their own environment. Clear (97% of 
transparency) and dark flasks with ca. 2000 ml 
capacity were filled up with water using a siphon. 
Apical branches of E. densa, with approximately 
15 cm length (0.35 g of dry weight) were placed in 
each flask. The incubations were done in triplicate. 
For further correction of the photosynthesis and 
respiration of the macrophyte, the production and 
respiration of the phytoplankton was measured 
from one clear and one dark flask that did not 
contain the plant. The incubations were placed on 
the surface and at the bottom of the river (0.9 to 
1.8 m depending on the river and sampling 
period), in horizontal position, for a period of 4 h 
(approximately 10:00 to 14:00 h).  Afterwards the 
water from the flasks was siphoned to 150 ml 
flasks for the measurements of dissolved O2 

(mg/L) using the Winkler’s method (Golterman   
et al., 1978). The titration was made by an 
electronic burette (Scohtt Gerate, model T 80/10). 
Dry weight of the plant material used in the 
incubations was obtained by drying it at 60ºC until 
constant weight. 
The gross and net photosynthesis and the 
respiration were calculated using the following 
equations described in Vollenweider (1974): 

 
NP = (c-i)v/(t.DW) 
R = (i-d)v/(t.DW) 
GP = NPP + R 

 
NP being the net photosynthesis (mgO2/gDW/h), 
R: respiration (mgO2/gDW/h), GP: gross 
photosynthesis (mgO2/gDW/h), c: O2 
concentration in the clear flask and d in the dark 
flasks (mg/L), i: initial O2 concentration in the 
flasks (mg/L), v: flask volume (L), t: incubation 
time (h) and DW: plant dry weight (grams).  
At the beginning of the incubation, values of pH, 
electrical conductivity (El. cond.) (µS/cm), 
temperature (°C) and turbidity (NTU) were taken 
in triplicates, using the Water Quality Checker, 
Horiba (model U10). The photosynthetic active 
radiation (PAR) (µmol/m2/s) was measured with 
the Light Meter LiCor (model 189) coupled to an 
underwater Quantum Sensor Licor (model 192) 
and the coefficient of the vertical attenuation (k) 
was calculated using the following equation: k = 
(ln.Io - ln.I)/z, where ln is the natural logarithm, I 
is the PAR at a determined depth (m), Io is the 
PAR at the surface and z is the depth (m) (Wetzel, 
1975). Water (1 L) for further measurement of the 
total alkalinity (meq/L), by titration, and total CO2 
concentration (mg/L), according to Mackereth et 
al. (1978) was sampled, in triplicates, from the site 
where the incubation had been carried out. 
Approximately 0.5 L  of the water sample was 
filtered (Whatman GF/C) in the field laboratory, 
kept in polyethylene flasks and frozen to -20 ºC. 
Non filtered samples (0.5 L) were also frozen in 
the same manner. 
The concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen (N-
ammoniacal) (µg/L) (Koroleff, 1976), nitrite (N-
NO2) (µg/L), nitrate (N-NO3) (µg/L) and total 
dissolved N (TDN) (mg/L) (Mackereth et al., 
1978) as well as total dissolved P (TDP) (µg/L) 
and orthophosphates (P-PO4) (µg/L) (Golterman  
et al., 1978) were measured from the filtered 
samples in the Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology

from the Department of Ecology of UNESP/Rio 
Claro-SP. The total suspended matter (Susp. 
matter) (µg/L) was determined according to 
Clesceri et al. (1989). The non-filtered water 
samples were used to determine total nitrogen 
(TN) (mg/L) (Mackereth et al., 1978) and total 
phosphorus (TP) ( µg L-1) (Golterman et al., 1978).  
Samples sediment were also collected in triplicates 
to measure total nitrogen (TN) (%PS), using the 
Kjeldahl method (Allen et al., 1974), and total 
phosphorus (TP) (%PS) (Esteves, 1980) and 
organic matter (Org. matter) (%PS) by incineration 
at 500 °C. 
Apical branches of E. densa were also collected in 
triplicate from the banks of the two rivers, near the 
site where the incubation was carried out, for 
further measurement of chlorophyll a and b (%PS) 
using the method by Vollenweider (1974). For 
these measurements, fresh branches of E. densa 
were washed to remove periphyton and debris and 
kept frozen in the dark to avoid chlorophyll 
degradation. 
The Principal Components Analysis (Ludwig and 
Reynolds, 1988), based on the abiotic variables 
measured, was used to ordinate the sites (rivers) and 
data collection times. For this analysis and for the 
variance analysis (ANOVA), the statistic software 
SYSTAT (version 5.03) was used (Wilkinson, 
1990). For the analysis of variance the data were 
transformed, if necessary, and   differences were 
considered significant when p &amp;lt;0.05. 
 
 
STUDY AREA 
 
This study was carried out in the Aguapeú and 
Mambu rivers located in the hydrographic basin of 
the Itanhaém River. In these rivers, E. densa grows 
in dense stands but does not influence the river’s 
multiple uses. This hydrographic basin has a total 
area of 900 km2 and it is located on the South 
coast of São Paulo State, South-eastern Brazil 
(Camargo et al., 1997). 
Fifty percent of the basin is located in a mountain 
range region with altitudes varying between 500 
and 1000 m, covered by dense vegetation of a well 
preserved area of tropical rain forest in the State 
Park of the Sea Range (Parque Estadual da Serra 
do Mar). The remaining 50% of the area of the 
basin are located in the coastal plain with an 

altitude up to 20 m and a well preserved       
natural vegetation in some parts and disturbed 
areas consisting of banana farms. The middle    
and final sections of the two rivers meander    
through the coastal plain with a slow current 
(Camargo et al., 1997). 
Aguapeú River has black water while Mambu 
River has clear water, both rivers have low current 
velocity (0.4 cm/s in Aguapeú River and 0.3 cm/s 
in Mambu River). In the coastal plain, the 
Aguapeú River is colonised by several macrophyte 
species, including floating species (e.g. Pistia 
stratiotes L., Salvinia molesta D.S. Mitchell, 
Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms), emergent 
species (e.g. Eichhornia azurea (Swartz) Kunth), 
floating leaves species (e.g. Nymphaea rudgeana 
C. F. Mey) and submerged species (Cabomba   
furcata Schult and Schult. f., Egeria densa 
Planch.), while the Mambu River is colonised  
only by submerged species (Cabomba furcata, 
Egeria densa). 
According to Lamparelli and Moura (1998), the 
climate of the region presents little variation due to 
its latitude and the proximity to the Atlantic 
Ocean. Rain is abundant (annual mean of 2183 
mm) and well distributed throughout the year, with 
more rainfall in March (279.9 mm) and less in 
August (84.7 mm). The atmospheric temperature 
in the region is high, with a minimum mean of 
19.0 ºC (July) and a maximum mean of 26.2 ºC 
(February). There is little variation of the annual 
photoperiod with slightly longer days in summer 
(13 h) than in winter (11 h). Solar radiation varies 
mainly according to the alternation of sunny and 
rainy days during all seasons of the year.  
 
 
RESULTS 
 
The values of the physical and chemical variables 
of the water and the sediment of the Aguapeú 
River are presented in Table 1. The water 
temperature variation was small during the period 
of analysis, with a maximum of 23.7 ºC in 
February and a minimum of 20.2 ºC in August and 
November. The highest amount of dissolved CO2 
was found in the water of the Aguapeú River, with 
a maximum of 5.45 mg/L in November and a 
minimum of 3.08 mg/L in August.

The photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) 
measured on the surface was higher in May 
(1,126.67 µmol/m2/s), being statistically different 
from the measurements obtained during the other 
months (F= 33.53, p= 0.00007). The PAR value 
measured at the bottom (1.60 m) in May was 61.54 
µmol/m2/s, being eighteen times lower than the 
value measured at the surface. 
The values of k were not statistically different, 
varying between 2.76 and 4.72 (F= 4.24, p= 
0.052). The values of the physical and chemical 
variables of the water and the sediment of the 
Mambu River are presented in Table 2. The water 
temperature variation was small during the period 
of analysis, with a maximum of 21.2 ºC in 
February and a minimum of 18.2 ºC in November. 
The maximum concentration of CO2 in the water 
was found in February (3.78 mg/L) and the 
minimum in August (0.54 mg/L). The PAR 
measured on the surface was higher in May 
(895.77 µmol/m2/s) being statistically different 
from the measurements obtained for the other 
months (F= 28.18, p= 0.00013). The PAR 
measured at the bottom (1.30 m) in May (172.41 

µmol/m2/s) was five times lower than at the  
surface.  The values of k obtained at the different 
months during the analysis were not statistically 
different, but were lower than the ones obtained 
for the Aguapeú River, varying between 1.51 and 
2.27 (F= 0.89, p= 0.458). The values GP, NP and 
R of E. densa are shown in Table 3. In the 
Aguapeú River, the highest GP was measured in 
May at both the surface (10.06 mgO2/gDW/h) and 
the bottom (6.10 mgO2/gDW/h) of the river. The 
GP was two times higher at the surface than at the 
bottom during all months except February, when 
the values were nine times higher.  
In the Mambu River, the higher GP was also 
measured in May both on the surface (6.10 
mgO2/gDW/h) and on the bottom (5.60 
mgO2/gDW/h). On the surface, there were 
significant differences between the values obtained 
for May and the other months. The differences in 
the GP at the surface and bottom in the Mambu 
River were lower than in the Aguapeú River.

Table 4 presents the correlation between variables 
with principal components, Factor I and II, which 
together explained 76% of the total variation. 
Temperature, total CO2 and phosphorous 
concentration in the water and sediment were 
positively correlated to Factor I, while dissolved 
O2 was negatively correlated to the same factor. 
The variables correlated to Factor II were PAR in 
surface (negative correlation) and TN in the water 
(positive correlation).  
Fig. 1 shows the ordination by principal 
components (I and II) of the locals (rivers) and 
date of sampling collection. On the left side of 
Factor I, are the data for Mambu River (13/02/98, 
01/05/98, 12/08/98 and 04/11/98) and 13/08/98 in 
the Aguapeú River showing lower temperatures, 
total CO2 and phosphorous concentrations in the 
water and sediment and higher levels of dissolved 

O2 in the water. On the right side of Factor I are 
the data taken from the Aguapeú River (12/02/98, 
02/05/98 and 05/11/98) showing to have opposite 
characteristics compared to the ones from the left 
side. In relation to Factor II, it was observed that 
in May, in both rivers, the values obtained for 
PAR in the surface were higher than the values 
obtained in the other months, whereas TN 
concentration in the water were lower.  
The concentrations of chlorophyll a and b in E. 
densa in the Aguapeú and Mambu rivers are 
presented in Table 5. In November chlorophyll a 
and b concentrations in the Aguapeú River were 
significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower than the 
measurements taken during the other months. 
However, in Mambu River there were no 
significant differences in the chlorophyll 
concentrations during the time of analysis.

DISCUSSION 
 
During this study, a relatively narrow variation of 
the temperature (20 - 23°C in the Aguapeú River 
and 18 - 21°C in the Mambu River) of the water of 
the two rivers was observed (Tables 1 and 2). At 
the same time, a small variation in the contents of 
chlorophyll a and b of E. densa from both rivers 
was also observed implying that there were no 

periods of growth and senescence (Table 5). It has 
been reported that in tropical regions, there was no 
significant seasonal changes in the biomass of 
emergent and submerged species of macrophytes 
and that the growth of the aquatic vegetation 
occurred throughout the year (Payne, 1986; 
Esteves and Camargo, 1986). Menendez and 
Sanches (1998) noticed differences between the 
minimum and maximum NP for Potamogeton

pectinatus (approximately 10 times) and for Chara 
hispida (approximately 5 times). They also 
observed that the values for photosynthetic rates, 
temperature and chlorophyll a and b were 
generally higher in spring and summer. In a 
coastal lake in the Northeast of Spain, Menendez 
and Peñuelas (1993) measured a NP two times 
higher for Ruppia cirrhosa in spring than in 
autumn and winter. These differences have been 
attributed to the seasonal variations of light  and 
temperature (minimum 7°C and maximum 30°C) 
and to the stage of the plant development, autumn 
and winter coinciding with the senescence period.  
Comparison of the data obtained in this study for 
NP (maximum and minimum) with data from 
other investigations, carried out in temperate 
regions, showed evidence of a small amplitude 
between maximum and minimum values of NP for 
E. densa (Table 6). This small annual range of NP 
was probably due to the climatic conditions with 
narrow seasonal variation.  
There was a small difference in E. densa 
photosynthetic rates measured on the surface of 
the water in both rivers among the periods of 
analysis. However, in May the measurements for 
GP, NP and R taken from the Mambu River were 
significantly higher from those obtained in the 
other months.  
The higher values of photosynthetic rates obtained 
in May were probably related to the higher values 
of PAR measured in the same month. It could be 
important to mention that the measurements taken 
on May 1998 (01 and 02) were the only ones taken 
on sunny days and the PAR in the study area was 
mainly correlated to the occurrence of sunny and 
rainy days. The lowest value for GP was measured 
at the bottom of the Aguapeú River in February 
and this coincided with the lowest PAR measured. 
Other authors like Madsen and Sand-Jensen 
(1994), working with Elodea canadensis and 
Callitriche cophocarpa, also observed a positive 
relationship between photosynthesis and light 
intensity. 
It was observed that there was a difference 
between the GP values from the surface and       
the ones from the bottom of the Aguapeú River 
(the former being nine times higher) while the 
results obtained from the Mambu River were 
almost the same. The low values for the bottom of 
the Aguapeú River were probably related to the 
low PAR attributed to the high value of k in this 
river.  The high k value was probably due to the 
dark colour (black) of the water from this river, 

because the values obtained for the suspended 
matter and the depth for the two rivers were 
similar. The lowest GP values were measured at 
the bottom of Aguapeú River, but the values for 
the GP on the surface of this river were in average, 
approximately two times higher than the ones from 
the Mambu River. 
The higher gross photosynthesis of E. densa in the 
Aguapeú River was also probably related to the 
highest amounts of total CO2 in the water of this 
river. The inorganic carbon concentration in the 
water was an important factor that controlled the 
growth of the submerged macrophyte. Steemann-
Nielsen (1960) stated that the elodeid angiosperms 
were rare or absent in lakes with low levels of total 
CO2. Madsen and Sand-Jensen (1987) observed 
that the growth of Elodea canadensis was very 
slow in low total CO2 concentrations, whereas 
Madsen and Sand-Jensen (1994) measured, under 
laboratory conditions, increased photosynthesis in 
E. canadensis and C. cophocarpa following an 
increase in total inorganic carbon. The higher 
phosphorus concentrations in the water and 
sediment of the Aguapeú River could also explain 
the higher GP from the surface of this river.  
It was possible to conclude, based on the results 
presented in this paper, that the parameters which 
controlled the photosynthetic rate of E. densa were 
the PAR and the total CO2 and phosphorous 
concentration in the water and sediment. E. densa 
also grew in less favourable conditions, but with 
lower values of net photosynthesis. The survival 
ability of E. densa under unfavourable conditions 
was also demonstrated by Feijoó et al. (1996) and 
this could explain the undesirable growth of E. 
densa in some aquatic ecosystems when the 
conditions are sub-optimal.

Photosynthetic Rate of the Aquatic Macrophyte Egeria densa Planch. 

Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology

RESUMO 
 
Egeria densa é uma macrófita aquática submersa 
que, no Brasil, tem causado prejuízos 
principalmente na geração de energia elétrica. O 
objetivo deste estudo é avaliar a taxa fotossintética 
de E. densa em dois rios com características 
limnológicas diferentes (Aguapeú e Mambu), 
ambos pertencentes à bacia do rio Itanhaém. Esta 
espécie ocorre abundantemente em ambos os rios, 
mas sem causar danos aos seus usos múltiplos. As 
determinações das taxas fotossintéticas foram 
realizadas em fevereiro, maio, agosto e novembro 
de 1998 e as variáveis limnológicas da água e do 
sedimento também foram analisadas. A maior 
fotossíntese bruta (FB) foi medida em maio (10,06 
no rio Aguapeú e 6,10 mgO2/gDW/h no rio 
Mambu), quando a radiação fotossinteticamente 
ativa (RFA) também foi maior (1126,7 e 895,7 
µmol/m2/s, respectivamente). FB, fósforo total, 
CO2 total e RFA foram sempre maiores no rio 
Aguapeú.
