ABSTRACT 
 

Many of Brazil’s pre-salt basins are located in ultra-deep waters, and the high 

heterogeneities of its offshore carbonate reservoirs make the extraction of representative 

rock samples difficult, risky and expensive. Synthetic plugs are required to understand 

oilfield properties and the behavior of oil in reservoirs where natural plugs cannot be 

extracted. Specifically, in cases where it is necessary to reproduce representative 

mineralogical and petrophysical characteristics from carbonates reservoir, it is evident that 

there are a lack of publications focusing on synthetic plug construction. In this work, the 

construction of synthetic plugs is studied, using a combination of published methodologies 

to achieve an alternative construction of synthetic carbonate plugs for laboratory scale 

studies. The obtained plugs used a procedure based on disintegrated rock matrices with 

known particle sizes and particle size ratio, uniaxial compaction with controlled load force 

and velocity, CaCO3 solubility control by changing temperature and pH and bonding 

material. Consolidation, wettability and petrophysical properties of the synthetic plugs 

were evaluated to characterize them. Generally, it was observed that the porosity and 

permeability features of the synthetic plugs were within the range of carbonate reservoirs. 

However, without reproducing a heterogeneous pore structure normally present in natural 

samples. On the other hand, wettability properties of the resulted synthetic plugs were 

similar to the natural carbonate plugs.  Further studies are necessary to obtain more 

similar chemical and petrophysical properties to the natural samples.

RESUMO 
 

A localização em águas ultra profundas das reservas petrolíferas do pré-sal brasileiro e 

a alta heterogeneidade dos seus reservatórios carbonáticos dificultam a aquisição de 

uma amostra de rocha representativa, além de ser uma operação de risco e de alto 

dispêndio. Plugues sintéticos são utilizados para compreensão das propriedades dos 

campos petrolíferos e para avaliação do comportamento dos hidrocarbonetos em 

reservatórios onde plugues reais não podem ser adquiridos. Especificamente, nos casos 

onde são necessários reproduzir características representativas mineralógicas e 

petrofísicas dos reservatórios carbonáticos, sendo notório a falta de publicações voltada 

para construção de plugues sintéticos. No presente trabalho, estudou-se a construção de 

plugues sintéticos empregando metodologias já difundidas, visando a construção de 

plugues carbonáticos sintéticos para utilização em escala laboratorial. Os plugues obtidos 

foram construídos utilizando matrizes de rochas desintegradas com tamanhos e 

proporções de partículas conhecidos, compactação uniaxial com força e velocidades 

controladas e controle de solubilidade de CaCO3, variando apenas temperatura, pH e 

proporções de material cimentante. Foram avaliadas as propriedades petrofísicas, a 

molhabilidade e a consolidação dos plugues sintéticos para posterior caracterização dos 

mesmos. Comumente, observou-se que os valores de porosidade e permeabilidade dos 

plugues sintéticos se encontravam dentro do intervalo de valores obtidos em 

reservatórios carbonáticos reais. No entanto, não reproduziram a estrutura heterogênea 

dos poros, normalmente presente em amostras de rochas naturais. Em contrapartida, as 

propriedades de molhabilidade dos plugues sintéticos se apresentaram análogas aos 

plugues de rochas carbonáticas naturais.  Estudos complementares são necessários para 

obtenção de propriedades químicas e petrofísicas mais próximas das amostras reais.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The study of petroleum reservoirs from plugs has a long importance dating back to 

the beginning of the oil and gas industry. Plugs are cylindrical rocks with specific 

dimensions about 3.8 cm in diameter and a height 1.5 times greater than the diameter, 

extracted by drilling from reservoirs (CONSENTINO, 2001). Due to the representative in-

situ characteristics such as mineralogical composition and petrophysical properties 

(CONSENTINO, 2001), plugs are used to understand at a laboratory scale the behavior 

and interaction of the reservoir rocks and fluids in a production system (GAAFAR; 

TEWARI; ZAIN, 2015; ALOTAIBI; AZMY; NASR-EL-DIN, 2010). For example, Svec and 

Grigg (2001), used plugs to study the enhance oil recovery during an injection of water 

alternating gas; Howe et al. (2015) flowed surfactants through plugs to study changes in 

oil production; Zamirian et al. (2014) reported new techniques for measuring 

permeabilities under in-situ conditions using plugs.  

In cases such as the Brazilian Presalt carbonate reservoirs, heterogeneity and high 

depths (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012; BARBASSA, 2007) make it difficult to obtain reservoir 

plugs. Due to this challenge, commercial plugs (SANNI, 2013; CHURCHER et al, 1991) 

or synthetic plugs constructed in the laboratory (TAREK 2014; GREAVES et al, 1996; 

BERNARD, 1967; FURRE; HOLT, 1995) may be used. Some research works can be 

found in the literature relating about the construction of this plugs, but in contrast to the 

sandstone reservoirs (WANG et al, 2008; RAIMONDI; TORCASO, 1964; ANBAH; 

CHILINGAR; BEESON, 1965), there is a lack of publications that focus on the construction 

of representative carbonates that consider both mineralogical composition and 

petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability. 

In this sense, the contribution of this work is to study a methodology to construct 

synthetic carbonate plugs, using a combination of published methodologies aiming to 

reproduce the mineralogy and control the petrophysics properties similar to the natural 

samples, in order to enable the generation of promising studies to understand the oil and 

gas reservoirs, such as the Brazilian Presalt.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW 
 

2.1 CARBONATE NATURAL ROCK PROPERTIES  
 

In order to construct synthetic plugs with similar properties to natural rocks, it was 

necessary to screening properties of natural carbonate samples. Plugs are formed by 

carbonates or sandstones, which are the main conforming types of rock in oil and gas 

exploration areas (EHRENBERG; NADEAU, 2005). These two types of rocks have 

significant differences. The former is the sediment production location, and the latter is 

the higher chemical reactivity due to the carbonate mineral (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012). 

One of the know carbonate rock found in the Brazilian Presalt is the dolomite rock (JING 

et al., 2012; BOYD et al., 2015). Due to the rock chemistry, wettability properties of 

carbonate rocks are different of sandstone rocks. Wettability can be explained as the 

preference of a solid surface to be in contact with a fluid in the presence of other 

immiscible fluids (ANDERSON, 1986). Wettability of a solid surface can be preferentially 

hydrophilic (water-wet) or hydrophobic (oil-wet). Literature reports wettability of natural 

carbonate rocks to be intermediate and oil-wet (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012; MANRIQUE 

et al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; AKKURT et al., 2000), 

contrary to the known water-wet for sandstone rocks (PENTLAND et al., 2010; CHATZIS 

et al., 1988).   

Petrophysical characteristics are important in the evaluation and characterization 

of oilfields rocks (QIN et al., 2018). Petrophysics is defined as the study of physical, 

electrical and mechanical properties and rock-fluid interaction in a petroleum system 

(CHEN; PAGAN, 2013). In this work, it was studied the physical properties porosity and 

permeability in the synthetic plugs, in order to understand how to control and reproduce 

these properties similar to the samples found in oilfield. In this sense, it is important to 

mention that petrophysic properties of natural carbonate rocks are heterogeneous and 

highly variable, due to the combination of micro-porosities, intergranular porosities, vuggy 

porosities and fracture porosities (MURPHY et al., 1996). Table 2.1 presents the 

petrophysical properties of some carbonate Brazilian Presalt oilfields, in order to evidence 



 22 

the mentioned highly variable properties. Additionally, it was observed porosities from 6% 

to 28% and permeabilities from 0.1 mD to 10000 mD.

2.2 CONSTRUCTION OF SYNTHETIC PLUGS 

 

A selection of papers was screened by using the following keywords: lithology 

(carbonate), rock sampling (plug or core) and sample feature (synthetic or artificial). Only 

papers focused on the use of such samples for the petroleum engineering area, and the 

ones where the construction methodology could be identified, were considered. In 

addition, some undergraduate and master's degree works were analyzed. 

 

2.3 MATERIALS AND CONTENTS USED TO CONSTRUCT SYNTHETIC PLUGS 
 
Due to the relationship between the rock chemistry and the material used to 

construct synthetic plugs, it was important to identify the main materials and their contents 

which were used to construct such samples, independent of the approach used for their 

construction, such us uniaxial compression, cementing of materials, sintering and others. 

In this way, it was possible to identify 10 different materials and theirs contents. 

Table 2.2 presents these materials, their content range and associated publications.

From Table 2.2, it is possible to identify the materials content range from 50% to 

100% (w/w) of the synthetic plugs. Note that from these 10 materials, 6 correspond to 

sand matrices, and the rest include crushed formation rock, CaCO3, bentonites and 

kaolinites. Most of these selected studies were therefore based on the construction of 

sandstone plugs. There are two likely reasons for this finding. The first is that constructing 

a porous media with a naturally granulated material, with known particle size, is fast and 

easy. The second is that because it is a porous media, it allows studies with no influence 

of chemical reactivity, due to the simple chemical composition of the sand (silicon and 

oxygen) (WEINAN et al., 1997). 

Regarding the approach for construction of carbonate plugs, it was possible to 

identify four works that used a carbonate matrix material and its content (ANBAH; 

CHILINGAR;  BEESON, 1965; FEDRIZZI et al., 2018; WANG et al. 2017; LUO et al. 

2018). For example, Anbah; Chilingar and  Beeson (1965) used calcite flour as its main 

component material (95% w/w), carbonate plugs were constructed for the application of 



 24 

electrical current to increase the flow rate of oil and water in a porous media, however 

petrophysical properties were not reproduced or correlated with the presented 

methodology. From another approach, Fedrizzi et al. (2018) related the construction of 

carbonate rocks using calcite, sand, Portland cement and water. In this work, it was 

investigated the main petrophysical characteristics of these samples and the relationship 

with the amount of cementing material, however this study did not consider the possible 

heterogeneous porous structure of natural carbonate rocks. The construction of 

representative synthetic carbonate plugs requires special pore studies considerations that 

it was not studied by Fedrizzi et al. (2018). 

Wang et al. (2017), during the construction process, embedded NaCl grains of 

average particle size of 3mm and aluminum foils with radius of 1.5 mm and a thickness of 

20 µm into a blend of carbonate drilling cuttings and epoxy resin. Then, the embedded 

materials were leached out by immersing the consolidated synthetic plug in 75 ºC water 

and 4% NaOH (sodium hydroxide) alkali solution respectively. The use of these materials 

and procedures simulates vuggy (due to the NaCl) and crack (due to the aluminum foils) 

pores into the samples. Their observation indicated that secondary pores crack and vuggy 

are important factors to control the permeability of the synthetic plugs. It was observed 

that increasing the quantity of NaCl grains the permeability increases with the increase of 

total porosity, contrary to the observed with aluminum foils which decrease the 

permeability and increase the porosity, increasing the quantity of aluminum foil used. 

However, it is necessary to develop a better understand about the pore structure and the 

influence of the quantity of epoxy resin and particle size drilling cuttings in the 

petrophysical properties. Additionally, the chemical nature of epoxy resin as bonding 

material could change the chemical properties of the constructed samples, fact that can 

affect the fluid-rock interaction tests, such as, wettability measurements.    

Therefore, using the same base material, Luo et al. (2018) prepared drill cuttings 

with toluene as a packing fluid and then, they applied a compression press of 5000 psi for 

30 minutes to consolidate the synthetic plugs. As the main objective of this research was 

the evaluation of formation damage using synthetic plugs, the influence of compression 

press and drill cuttings particle properties in the petrophysical properties was not 

identified. In this sense, despite of mineralogical properties of the constructed plugs may 



 25 

be similar to the found in a specific field, these analog samples not guarantee the 

reproduction and control of similar petrophysical properties of the natural plugs. 

Additional papers were identified that used a non-carbonate matrix material, such 

as sands, but using cementing procedures to allow the calcium carbonate precipitation on 

them. Melo, (2012), evaluated a quartz sand (50% w/w) cemented in a medium favorable 

to precipitation of calcium carbonate to simulate a carbonate medium. The aim was to 

evaluate the geochemical interactions with a reactive fluid for carbon dioxide geological 

storage purposes. The findings and discussion about these approaches will be detailed in 

the following sections. 

According to Tiab and Donaldson (2004), petrophysical properties of rocks depend 

on the particle size, amount of cementation and compaction. For this reason, the next 

analyses from this literature review will be focused on these parameters. 

 

2.4 PARTICLE SIZE 
 
It is important to mention the importance of the particle size distribution on porosity 

and permeability. Particle size is defined as the size of each particle which compounds a 

porous media. Naturally, a rock is composed of different particle sizes, which generates a 

heterogeneous system. Empty spaces called pores are generated between these 

particles, and fluids, such as oil and gas, can be stored in these spaces in reservoir rock. 

The measurement of this empty space, commonly known as porosity, is defined by the 

relation between the volume of the empty space and the bulk volume of the sample (where 

pore volume is dependent on the volume of particle, and therefore also dependent on its 

size) and calculated using equation (1) (TIAB; DONALDSON, 2004; HOLSTEIN, 2007).

In the case of an ideal system with an arrangement of uniform spheres and a fixed 

bulk volume, the porosity will be independent of the particle volume, and therefore of the 

particle size. But in a real system with particles of different sizes, smaller particles enter 



 26 

the empty spaces between the larger particles, thus decreasing the porosity. This 

demonstrates the importance of the particle size on the resulting porosity (HOLSTEIN, 

2007). Figure 1 presents a schematic of three porous solids with the same dimension and 

composed by different particle sizes: A. Large uniform particle, B. Uniform smaller particle 

size and C. Different size particles. For these cases, the porosity will be demonstrated 

based on Equation 1. The bulk volume of the three solids with dimensions, L, was 

calculated. 

 
 

????	?????? = ? × ? × ? =	?9 (2) 
 
 
Subsequently, it is necessary to calculate the volume occupied by the particles in 

each of the examples cited previously. For this, it is necessary to employ the following 

volume sphere equations: A. L/2 radius, B. 8 spheres of L/4 radius and C. 8 spheres of 

L/4 radius for larger particles, and 6 spheres of L/6 for smaller particles.

According to the obtained results, it was shown that in ideal systems with uniform 

particles, as for cases A and B, the resulting porosity is the same, corroborating the non-

relation between particle size and porosity. Otherwise, in the real system, C, that contains 

particles of different sizes, the presence of smaller particles affects the porous space and 

decreases the porosity. In the same way, similar reductions for porosity are expected due 

to the influences of compaction and cementation. This occurs because empty spaces will 

be filled by particles or cementitious materials, which decreases the percentage of pores 

in a solid sample. In addition, the ability of the oil stored in the pores to flow through a 

reservoir rock, known as permeability, has a direct relationship with the particle size, 

consolidation and cementation of the sample. 

In cases where a solid possesses connected pores, the presence of smaller 

particles occupying the empty spaces, as well as high degrees of compaction and 

cementation, generally reduce the permeability. This can be corroborated by the 

mathematical equation by Darcy for the flow of a fluid in a porous medium, by studying 

the pressure gradients (TIAB; DONALDSON, 2004; HOLSTEIN, 2007).

Figure 1 presents an interpretation of the flow of a fluid within 3 types of porous solids. 

From here, it is possible to demonstrate the application of the previous mathematical equation by 

Darcy. Flow restrictions caused by a decrease of the porous space due to the presence of particles 



 28 

of different sizes, compaction, or cementation result in a increase in the pressure gradients, and 

therefore lower permeabilities.

It is important to mention that only 33 papers described particle sizes, allowing the 

identification of a range from 0.017 mm to 4.76 mm. To have a better view of the particle 

sizes used, the times in which these granulometries were used versus particle size was 

plotted. Figure 2 presents this particle distribution. It should be noted that the thickest and 

finest particles were less used. This could be explained by causing a weak consolidation 

of the sample for the former, and a substantial decrease in the porosities and 

permeabilities for the latter. However, fine particle sizes can improve the consolidation 

behavior due to the particle agglomeration by compression (CI, 1987). In addition to this, 

a clear tendency to use particle from 0.841 mm to 0.037 mm sizes and close to 0.149 mm 

was identified.  

 
Figure 2 - Particle size based on the literature review to construct synthetic plugs. 

 
Table 2.3 presents papers where these particle size materials were used to 

construct synthetic plugs. For example, in the work of Furre and Holt (1995), two materials 

with a particle size distribution centered around diameters 0.053 and 0.297 mm, were 

cemented with epoxy resin to construct a porous medium to study the acoustic behavior, 

in order to compare the permeability of synthetic sandstone samples.

2.5 METHODOLOGIES FOR CONSOLIDATION OF SYNTHETIC PLUGS 
 

The methodology used for consolidation of the plugs was categorized into five 

groups: Group 1: unconsolidated samples; Group 2: consolidated by compaction; Group 

3: consolidated by bonding materials; Group 4: consolidated by material solubility or 

precipitation; Group 5: consolidated by materials sintering and Group 6: consolidated by 

3D-printed. Following items present the mentioned groups.   

 
2.5.1 Group 1 – Unconsolidated samples 
 

A rock plug sample may be unconsolidated, as with unconsolidated sand, 

depending on the oilfield properties as in the case of Wang et al. (2008). For this reason, 

after a particle size analysis of reservoir rock particles, the author mixed sands of sizes 

between 0.4 and 0.125 mm, and this was used to represent the reservoir zone of interest. 

Another material conforming to unconsolidated plugs was found (HASHMAT et al., 

2016). Here, packed glass beads of different sizes were used to study the chemical 

interaction of fluids within the porous media. The author justified the control of porosities 

and permeabilities due to the use of glass beads and its physical standard characteristics. 

Based on the same packaging principle quartz sand of size 0.595-0.297 mm was used, 

packed in a stainless-steel tube and sterilized at 165 ° C for 3 hours. The sample was 

used for a fluid displacement test (XU; LU, 2011). 

 
2.5.2 Group 2 – Consolidation by compaction 
 

Within the consolidated samples, compaction was identified as one of the 

methodologies with greater application. Here, a load to the plug can be exerted in a 

uniaxial or triaxial way. For example, by mixing particles of sand with shale in different 

proportions and applying a uniaxial compaction within a metallic cell. As a result, a 

consolidated rock sample can be obtained and used to analyze the dielectric constants of 

the rocks (WEINAN et al., 1997). 



 32 

In this same way, it was proposed to obtain consolidated synthetic plugs by using 

unconsolidated reservoir rock samples (LUQUOT et al., 2016). The samples were 

disintegrated manually to guarantee the same particle size of natural unconsolidated rock. 

In the mentioned work, the aim was to compare the porosity, particle size and internal 

structure of unconsolidated and synthetic plugs. It was concluded that both samples had 

similar properties. In addition, it can be emphasized that in this way, it is possible to 

guarantee a natural sample reproduction. 

 

2.5.3 Group 3 – Consolidation by bonding materials 
 

One of the first methodologies regarding the consolidation of plugs using bonding 

materials was reported in 1999 (THOMPSON et al., 1999). This consolidation was 

achieved by applying a uniaxial force into a mixture of quartz and epoxy resin, during the 

curing process of the epoxy. These constructed plugs were used to evaluate the 

compressive strength of the plugs. It is noteworthy that properties such as porosity and 

permeability of these plugs were not evaluated due to its geophysics application studies. 

Subsequently, based on previous methodology by Thompson et al. (1999), 

sandstone rock plugs were constructed by Tarek (2014) aiming to simulate reservoir 

conditions and evaluate the xanthan gum effect on water production. Portland cement 

was used instead as a bonding material. The composition of the sandstone samples was 

74% (w/w) sand, with particle sizes of 0.71 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.25 mm. The mixture 

consisted of 14.8% (w/w) Portland cement and 11.1% (w/w) water. 

On the other hand, other authors developed an equipment called EDR - Radial 

Displacement Equipment, Londoño (2010) apud Celis and Fernandez (2012) and Alarcon 

and Cavanzo (2013), which allowed them to simulate the physical behaviour of water and 

steam injection processes in synthetic sandstone rocks. For such, synthetic samples were 

constructed using sand and polyester resin as a bonding material, however, without 

control of petrophysical properties. 

Based on the previous methodology of Londoño (2010), a methodology for plug 

construction with controlled petrophysics properties (porosity and permeability) was 

developed, by mixing different quantities of sand, white kaolin and resin epoxy (CELIS; 



 33 

FERNANDEZ, 2012). The author concluded that a greater amount of binder material 

caused lower porosities and permeabilities. Alarcon and Cavanzo (2013) adapted the 

methodology used by Celis and Fernandez (2012) by using a manual compaction 

procedure that allowed synthetic plugs with different petrophysics properties to be 

obtained, although without the control of the manual applied force. 

Therefore, using the same homogenized material of Alarcon and Cavanzo (2013), 

Padron and Lizcano (2014) standardized the compaction process by applying controlled 

uniaxial torques, resulting in a greater reproducibility and repeatability of the petrophysical 

properties of the samples. 

Caceres and Porras (2015) focused their research on constructing electro-

pneumatic equipment that produced a more controlled and higher compaction than those 

obtained by Padron and Lizcano (2014). In this sense, the authors developed a 

methodology correlating the applied pressure and mixture composition (sand, white 

kaolin, epoxy resin and water). It was concluded that samples manufactured with 100 psi, 

using kaolin and sand with particle size of 0.149-0.074 mm, presented an excellent 

consolidation. Additionally, porosities between 21 to 33%, and permeabiities between 40 

to 470 mD, were observed. Consequently, the authors recommended the construction of 

high pressure equipment to obtain samples with lower petrophysical properties. 

 

2.5.4 Group 4 – Consolidation by material solubility or precipitation 
 

Within the synthetic plug construction, the consolidation by precipitation of silica 

and carbonate materials was identified. 

Holt et al. (2003) and Brignoli et al. (1998) describe precipitation, and subsequent 

consolidation, of silica by CO2 flowing in a homogeneous sand and sodium silicate 

solution, which was subsequently subjected to uniaxial and confinement pressure. The 

authors concluded that samples had weak mechanical properties. In turn, they emphasize 

that due to the particle size distribution and precipitated material quantity, it will be possible 

to control the petrophysical properties. 

From another consolidation perspective by calcium carbonate, two types of 

methodologies were identified: use of bacteria (biologically induced precipitation) and 



 34 

enzyme-induced precipitation. A biologically induced precipitation, with a petroleum 

engineering application, was described in Ferris et al. (1992). This consolidation method 

employed a flow of solution consisting of Bacillus pasteurii NRS 673 bacteria, Difco 

nutrient, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, anhydrous calcium chloride and 

distilled water. Additionally, solvent and water stability precipitation were noted. The 

authors describe a permeability reduction on porous media, due to the carbonate 

precipitation. In addition, this paper emphasizes that this carbonate acted like two agents: 

cementer and obstructer.  

Van-paassen et al. (2009) described some of the improvements that are obtained 

implementing the biologically induced carbonate precipitation. In this sense, regarding 

construction of experimental plugs, the author used sand with a density of 1560 kg/m3 

added into a suspension solution of ureolitic bacteria "sporosarcina pasteurii", urea and 

calcium chloride. After the treatment, five sample blocks were extracted by drilling, and 

cylindrical rock plugs with a fixed porosity value were obtained. 

Kucharski et al. (1996 and 1997) apud Al-Shahri et al. (2010), Yasuhara et al. 

(2012) and Ronan (2005) describe a controlled calcium carbonate precipitation process 

around silicon sand. This process simulated a natural cementation rock, and used a 

patented aqueous solution flow at low pressure. This method titled “CIPS - Calcite in-situ 

precipitation system” allowed synthetic sample permeability control until a given condition. 

Ismail et al. (2000), based on the CIPS patent, developed a technique for artificially 

cemented calcareous soil preparation, looking for a high cementing quality and consistent 

density of the sample. 

Besides, Yasuhara et al. (2012) creates another method, justifying the CIPS 

unknown patent solutions and the complex management of containment, extinction and 

generation of bacteria. The author describes a precipitation method using urease, urea 

and calcium chloride. After testing this method, it was concluded that further studies are 

needed to understand how permeability and resistance can be restricted, controlling the 

amount of precipitated calcium carbonate.  

Another method based on carbonate precipitation was described by Melo (2012), 

adapting the Brazilian standard “NBR 7182: Construction of compacted soil samples” 

ABNT (1986) to construct a synthetic rock plug to study the behaviour of this sample in 



 35 

the presence of hydrochloric acid, aiming at carbon capture CO2 storage studies. For this 

reason, a quartz sand sample was cemented using a homogeneous aqueous calcium 

hydroxide and calcified green algae (halimeda), using a proportion of 50%, 25% and 25%, 

respectively. Subsequently, the sample was compacted and carbonated with CO2. From 

this work is important to note the author’s emphasis on carbonate mineralogical 

reproduction, despite not reproducing petrophysical properties. 

Pei et al. (2016) aiming to study seismic physical modelling, construct synthetic 

sandstone plugs applying a load force over a blend of quartz sand with controlled particle 

size (from 0,6 mm to 0,02 mm) and epoxy resin. The authors explain that changes in the 

porosity of the synthetic plugs, probably, occurs due the described particles size and the 

applied load force used to consolidate the sample, but, a relationship between these 

construction parameters and the obtained porosities was not identified. 

 
2.5.5 Group 5 – Consolidation by materials sintering 
 

Manière et al. (2017) describes a sintering process that involves a compacting heat 

treatment to transform powder into a solid material by the union of its particles. For this, 

heat treatments are required close to the material melting temperature. Some materials 

were found as a basis of consolidation by thermal sintering of materials: PTFE 

(Polytetrafluoroethylene) or Teflon and quartz. 

Mccaffery and Bennion (1974) describes the methodology for constructing plugs 

by using PTFE or Teflon particles previously compressed in a mould, where a temperature 

of 371°C was applied for a sintering process to occur. Anderson (1986) explains that 

Teflon guarantees an inert chemical composition and low surface energy, resulting on 

wettability control.   

Weinbrandt et al. (1969) and Farley et al. (1970) apud Mccaffery and Bennion 

(1974) indicate that porous media and surface of sintering PTFE samples appear like 

sandstone rocks. They claim this due to its pore structures at microscopic scale, rough 

and irregular surfaces, and uniform porosities and permeabilities. However, they did not 

elaborate on the surface chemical composition.  



 36 

Ranjbar et al. (1992) describes the production of porous models by quartz particle 

sintering, with particle sizes between 0.04 and 0.07 mm. The author justifies the use of 

this technique due to the easy cleaning procedure and reuse advantage. No concerns 

about mineralogical and petrophysical parameters control were considered.  

 

2.5.6 Group 6 – Consolidation by 3D-printed 
 

From another approach, Kong et al. (2018) manufactured synthetic plugs using 3-

D printed gypsum rock and evaluated its physical properties through quantitative porosity 

analyses. Their observation indicated that these manufacture rocks host spherical pores 

and fewer blade-shaped pores, evidencing a homogeneous pore structure. In contrast, 

additionally to the mentioned by the authors about the limitation of replicate similar natural 

rock pore frame due to the printing resolution, it can be noted that the use of gypsum 

powder may not represent a complex mineralogizes found in plugs from field. In this 

sense, it can be another limitation of these synthetic samples when submitted to 

interaction rock-fluid tests. 

In a summary, the construction of synthetic carbonate plugs is viable and 

dependent on the selected materials and methodologies. Therefore, there is a lack of 

researches focusing both mineralogical composition and petrophysical properties to 

reproduce a heterogeneous but controlled pore structure and chemical composition 

characteristics typical of carbonate oilfield rocks. In this way, this research presents a 

promising approach to obtain such plugs, aiming to contribute to the evidenced research 

lack.

3 PROPOSAL FOR CARBONATE PLUG CONSTRUCTION 
 

Plug composition has a direct relationship with the rock chemistry, and therefore 

with the behavior of the sample in the laboratory tests focused on the surface chemistry 

behavior, such as wettability measurements aimed at enhanced oil recovery studies. 

According to Abdallah et al. (2007), wettability refers to the preference of a solid 

surface to be in contact with a fluid, due to the equilibrium of interstitial forces (fluid-solid). 

In the case of a petroleum reservoir, these forces will generate a system with preferences 

to be oil-wet or water-wet due to the behavior between oil, water and reservoir rock. This 

means that due to the wettability, if reservoir rock is oil-wet, higher amounts of oil can 

remain retained inside the reservoir rock, resulting in a negative economic situation 

(ALOTAIBI et al., 2010). For example, in the case of sandstone rocks, preferences to be 

water-wet (PENTLAND et al., 2010; CHATZIS et al., 1988) were found, and carbonate 

rocks to be oil-wet (MANRIQUE et al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; PIZARRO; 

BRANCO, 2012) or with an intermediate wet behavior (AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; AKKURT 

et al., 2000) were found. 

Because these plugs can be also used for advanced petrophysics studies, such as 

flooding or wetting measurements, it is important to choose materials which allow 

synthetic carbonate samples to be built, guaranteeing their similarity to the natural ones, 

such as in studies of changing wettabilities due to the application of chemical treatments 

to the rock-fluid system in order to enhance oil production. 

To achieve carbonate reservoir samples that reproduce the proper mineral 

chemistry composition, materials based on silicas and sand, as well as bonding materials 

based on epoxy, resins and cements, will not be considered. Therefore, based on the 

developed methodologies by Lakatos et al. (2003) and Luquot et al. (2016), which used a 

disintegrated rock material to obtain a core plug, an adaptation is proposed that uses a 

disintegrated dolomitic carbonate rock. In this way, disintegrated carbonate rock will be 

the base material of synthetic plugs, guaranteeing a similar natural composition compared 

to the corresponding reservoir rock. Based on the previously particle size analysis by 

literature, a particle size control in five intervals around the most used granulometry was 



 38 

proposed, aiming to obtain plugs with different basic petrophysical parameters. They 

were: 0.3-0.6 mm, 0.15-0.3 mm, 0.074-0.15 mm, 0.020-0.074 mm and&amp;lt;0.020 mm. 

Additionally, it is proposed to use during the construction process some bonding 

materials in low content and the increasing calcium carbonate solubility followed by 

precipitation, in order to generate a natural bonding material into the particles used to 

construct the synthetic plugs. Figure 3 presents the related solubility due to the decreasing 

of both, pH and temperatures.

4 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 

4.1 BASE MATERIAL - DISINTEGRATED DOLOMITIC CARBONATE  
 

 The base material used in this work to construct synthetic plugs was a 

disintegrated dolomitic carbonate rock with controlled particle size. The base material was 

disintegrated first by a jaw crusher and then by a roller crusher. Chemical analysis of the 

dolomitic carbonate rock used was carried out by X-ray spectrometry fluorescence in the 

STD-1 (Standardless) calibration, concerning the analysis of chemical elements between 

fluorine and uranium. In addition, the loss on ignition (LOI) was carried out at 1020 °C for 

2 hours. 

Then, to obtain particle size intervals from 0.3-0.6 mm, 0.15-0.3 mm, 0.074-0.15 

mm, 0.02-0.074mm, and&amp;lt;0.02 mm, sieves with a known mesh (0.02mm, 0.074mm, 

0.15mm, 0.3mm and 0.6mm) were used.  

In cases where the quantity of the finest particle size (&lt;0.02 mm) obtained was too 

low, particle size 0.02-0.074 mm were sampled and pulverized in a Herzog pulverizer to 

obtain the needed material. To corroborate the true size of the finest particle material 

resulting from this procedure, a low angle laser light scattering measurement (Malvern 

Mastersizer) was used to assure particle size. 

 

4.2 METHODOLOGY TO CONSTRUCT SYNTHETIC PLUGS 
 

Two kinds of samples were constructed. One sample was composed of 5g of 

disintegrated rock and disk geometry of 3.77 cm diameter and 0.2 cm height. It was used 

to screening of the different parameters before the construction of the real size plugs. The 

other was composed of 100 g of disintegrated rock with a plug geometry of 3.77 cm 

diameter and 40 cm height and was used to reproduce the final plugs of real size with the 

identified better parameters. To study the effect of particle size of the base material on 

consolidation of the plugs, samples composed by a unique particle size and 1:1, 1:2, and 

1:3 ratios (w/w) of particle size (fine:coarse) were used as shown in Table 4.1.

Samples were constructed with and without using water content to study the 

sample consolidation. In case where water content was used, water content of 2,4,6,8 or 

10 w/w relative to the base material with pH 3 or 7 were mixed with the base material. 

Water content of pH 3 were carried out by and hydrochloric acid solution. Additionally, 

samples were constructed with and without using bonding materials to study the effect on 

both consolidation and wettability properties. The proportion used of these bonding 

materials were 5% w/w and 10% w/w relative to the base material. Table 4.2 reports the 



 41 

materials used to construct synthetic plugs. On the other hand, To study the effect of 

temperature on the consolidation of the sample based on CaCO3 solubility, it was 

submitted to a drying temperature of 25ºC (room temperature) or 100ºC (for 1 hour into 

an oven).  

In this way, a base material with known particle size and particle size ratio was 

placed in a plastic bag, manually mixed with the bonding material (if necessary) and the 

water content pH 3 or 7 (if necessary) by 1 minute. After this, the resulting blend was 

placed inside the cylindrical metallic vessel, which had previously been lubricated with an 

ethyl alcohol solution containing 1% w/w stearic acid powder. The dimensions of this 

vessel were 3.77 cm internal diameter, 3.00 cm thickness and 13.00 cm height and the 

dimension of the piston were 3.75 cm diameter and 15.90 cm height. A load (200 kN) was 

applied with controlled velocity (25mm/min) two times. To study the e 

Subsequently, the resulting consolidated sample was placed for 1 hour into an 

oven at 100ºC (if necessary) to guarantee a drier and higher consolidation based on 

CaCO3 solubility. After that, samples were exposed to room temperature. Photographic 

register of the samples was taken at 0, 1 and 120 hours after removing from compression 

moulding.

After this, the resulting blend was placed inside the cylindrical metallic vessel, 

which had previously been lubricated with an ethyl alcohol solution containing 1% w/w 

stearic acid powder. The dimensions of this vessel were 3.77 cm internal diameter, 3.00 

cm thickness and 13.00 cm height and the dimension of the piston were 3.75 cm diameter 

and 15.90 cm height. A load (200 kN) was applied with controlled velocity (25mm/min) 

two times. Subsequently, the resulting consolidated sample was placed for 1 hour into an 

oven at 100ºC to guarantee a drier and higher consolidation based on CaCO3 solubility. 

After that, samples were exposed to room temperature. Photographic register of the 

samples was taken at 0, 1 and 120 hours after removing from compression moulding. 

 

4.3 METHODOLOGIES TO EVALUATE SYNTHETIC PLUGS 
 
4.3.1 Immersion tests 

 
120 hours after removing from compression moulding, samples were submitted to 

a water immersion test for 12 hours to evaluate their stability related to consolidation. The 

main aim was to verify if such samples would not have disintegrated in this medium, which 

can be used in routine plug tests such as spontaneous imbibition, fluid displacement and 

saturation tests (GAAFAR et al., 2015). Photographic register of samples was done 

during, and 1 hour after the test. After the test, the samples were handled to verify their 

consolidation. 

 

4.3.2 Wettability measurements 
 

Air-water and air-mineral oil contact angle measurements were done using a DSA 

100 Kruss drop shape analyzer at room pressure and temperature conditions. 

Measurements were done on samples with a disk geometry. A drop of distilled water or 

mineral oil was placed on the flat surface of the sample and the contact angle was 

measured immediately and after 10 seconds.  

 



 43 

4.3.3 Gas porosimetry 
 

Gas porosimetry is a technique based on the gas expansion which allows the 

measurement of either pore or grain volume, grain density and permeability of a rock 

sample (DE OLIVEIRA et al., 2016). Before the test, synthetic plugs of full size (Figure 4, 

the part A) were dried for 24 hours in an oven at 60C with controlled humidity of 45%. 

Plugs were submitted to porosity and permeability gas (nitrogen) test with a confinement 

pressure of 2400 psi in an Ultrapore 300 porosimeter and Ultraperm 500 permeameter. 

Klikenber effect was corrected to obtain porosities and permeabilities results. Grain 

density is a measure of mass per unit of volume of the elemental composition and internal 

bonding materials of rocks (Schön, 2011). From this technique grain density can be also 

obtained. 

 

4.3.4 Mercury injection porosimetry 
 

A Micromeritics AutoPore IV mercury porosimeter was used to estimate the pore 

size distribution of the synthetic samples, porosity, permeability and grain density. Due to 

the limitation of sample size of the technique, full size plugs cannot be analyzed. In this 

sense, from plugs of full size used for the gas porosimetry test, it was necessary to extract 

a fragment rock to be study. For this reason, plugs were cut in 3 disk of 13.3 ± 0.1 mm 

height and extracted a fragment rock of 20 ± 0.1 mm width from the central disk. (Figure 

4, the part B). Synthetic plugs were cutting off carefully to avoid alterations of the pore 

space. After this, extracted fragments were dried for 24 hours in an oven at 100ºC and 

weight. This value was used as input data in the porosimeter software. A maximum 

intrusion mercury pressure of 40000 psi was used in all the tests.   

 
4.3.5 Theoretical porosity calculus  
 

In addition to gas and mercury porosimetry tests, the theoretical porosity value was 

used as an approximation to the expected porosity and it was used to be compared with 

the experimental results and calculate the deviation of the measures. It should be noted 



 44 

that experimental tests only access to the connected pores, in other words, the effective 

porosity.  

 

Theoretical porosity was calculated as follow: 

a) Calculus of the volume of the synthetic plugs, based on the measured diameters 

and heights (equation 10).

considering this as a homogeneous solid without porosity (equation 11).

4.3.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) 

analysis were conducted to determine the micro-structures and the identification of the 

surface elements in the samples. Surface images of a fragment plug size of 20 ± 0.1 mm 

width (Figure 4, the part B), cold-mounted (embedded) in epoxy resin were done at 

magnifications of 21x, 100x, 350x and 1000x by using a Stereoscan 440 LEO.

4.3.7 Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) 
 

A micro-computed tomography was used as nondestructive method of image 

acquisition. It was analyzed a sub-sample extracted of the plug of real size Figure 4 the 

part b, using a micro-CT Xradia versa xrm 510, with objective lens of 4x, 160 kV and 10W 

to observe the internal distribution of the materials used to construct the synthetic plugs.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 

5.1 MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION 
 

Firstly, it was corroborated the chemical composition of the dolomitic carbonate 

rock used to construct the synthetic plugs. Table 5.1 presents the chemical composition 

of the used dolomitic carbonate, obtained by X-ray spectrometry fluorescence. It is 

emphasized that according to Souza and Bragança (2013), the high concentration of the 

compounds MgO (15.5%-17.2%), SiO2 (4.51%-4.06%) and CaO (36.4%-33.8%) 

corresponds to dolomitic calcareous samples.

After the corroboration of the chemical composition of the mentioned dolomitic 

carbonate rock, samples were disintegrated and particle size controlled by a sieve. Figure 

5 presents the resulting particle size.

In addition, as mentioned previously, it was necessary to pulverize quantities of 

0.02-0.074 mm granulometry to obtain higher quantities of the finest particle (&lt;0.020 mm). 

Figure 6 shows the low angle laser light scattering measurement results of this particle 

size (percentage of volume versus size of particle, and accumulated percentage of the 

volume analysed). From this figure, it can be determined that according to the distribution 

of particle size, the material analysed has a particle size less than 0.020 mm. Therefore, 

it was concluded that the described procedure of pulverization of the sample is correct to 

obtain this specific finest particle.

5.2 CONSTRUCTION AND EVALUATION OF THE SYNTHETIC PLUGS  
 

The first disks geometry samples were constructed using a unique particle size and 

uniaxial compression, in order to observe the effect of the particle size in the consolidation.  

Figure 7 presents this exploratory samples after 120 hours of their construction. 

From this test, fragile disks with varying consolidation were observed, which was improved 

with a decrease in the particle sizes. This consolidation behavior can be explained 

probably due to favorable material agglomeration. This first exploratory test demonstrated 

a promising preliminary result regarding the construction of real size plugs.

using water content and additional bonding material.  Uniaxial compression (200 kN; 25 mm/min). 
After 120 hours of construction.   

 
Based on the previous results, the following samples were constructed using the 

proposed CaCO3 solubility. Aiming to evaluate the effect of these new parameters on plug 

consolidation, the pH effect was verified by adding distilled water content with pH values 

of 3 and 7 (2 to 10 w/w relative to the base material) to the 5 g particle size material, 

followed by mixing for 1 minute before the compression process. The acidity of the water 

was achieved by using diluted hydrochloric acid solution. 

The mixture was submitted to the same uniaxial compression used on previous 

exploratory tests. Load force and compression times used were fixed aiming to guarantee 

an experimental reproducibility, and compare the resulting plugs with exploratory ones. 

These samples were dried at room temperature (25 °C). Figures from the appendix A 

present all of the constructed disks, at 0 and 120 hours after the consolidation process. 

Figure 8 presents some of the resulting disks, in order to illustrate the following analysis.  

The consolidation behavior, again, present a tendency to improve with decreasing 

particle size. Figure 8, the part a and b present a resume of this improved consolidation 

corresponding to the decrease of particle size for disks with the same number of water 

content (8% w/w) with a pH value 3 and 7. In addition, it was noted an effect of the time 

of sample drying on the consolidation behavior, getting worse over time. It is due to 

temporary sample consolidations caused by the presence of humidity. On the other hand, 

comparing the Figure 8 the parts a and b, a possible calcium carbonate dissolution when

using acid water content (pH 3), followed by its probable precipitation, led to a more 

effective consolidation, even after 120 hours. In this way, the use of acid water would be 

the most beneficial way for the construction of samples, even when using larger particle 

sizes. 

Figure 8 the part c presents a resume of the consolidation sample behavior due to 

the content of water pH 7. From here, it was observed that few (2 and 4% w/w) or more 

(8 and 10% w/w) did not generate good material consolidation. This trend may be due to 

the amount of water not being enough to impregnate all of the particle surface, or the 

content of water being too much to allow good material handling, turning it into a very 

weak sample. Therefore, with water content of 6% w/w the material was not excessively 

humid, and the total impregnation of its particles was possible, causing a homogeneous 

solubility (in the case of acidic pH) and material consolidation. Finally, water content of 

6% w/w, pH=3 and particle size&amp;lt;0.02 mm seemed to generate the best disk 

consolidations

Next, the constructions were also performed by using a drying temperature of 100 

°C for 1 hour. Figures from the appendix B present all the constructed disks at 0 hours 

(after removing from compression moulding), 1 hour (after drying process at 100°C) and 

120 hours (after the consolidation process).  
 

Figure 9 presents a resume of this figures from appendix B, comparing constructed 

disks after 120 hours of construction, with particle size (0.074-0.150 mm), water content 

from 2 to 10 % w/w, pH value 7 and drying temperatures of 25°C and 100°C. From these 

samples, it was observed a positive influence on the consolidation of the material due to 



 53 

high drying temperatures. In this sense, samples with high drying temperatures (100 °C) 

present a tendency to have a better consolidation than those with dried at room 

temperature (25 °C). In addition, it is believed that due to the high temperature (100 °C), 

a lower content water was retained within the sample. This made it possible to guarantee 

a drier and more definitive consolidation.

Given the previous findings, a sample with a plug geometry were manufactured. 

For this reason, the construction conditions selected to guarantee a good consolidation 

were: the finest particle size material (&lt;0,020 mm), 6% w/w of water content at pH 3 and 

drying temperature of 100°C. The first synthetic plug of real size is presented in Figure 

10. Scratches on the lateral surface were observed, which seem to compromise the 

structure of the material. These samples were sanded (sandpaper N° 600), where it was 

observed that the scratches were superficial and therefore, did not affect the internal 

structure of the sample. It is notable that this sample presented a good consolidation 



 54 

before and after the sanding, confirming a good choice of the construction materials and 

method. 

Aiming to evaluate the basic petrophysical properties, samples were submitted to 

porosity and permeability gas (nitrogen) test with a confinement pressure of 2400 psi in 

an Ultrapore 300 porosimeter and Ultraperm 500 permeameter, both from Corelab. For 

the synthetic plug, a porosity of 25.19% +/-1% was obtained, and mean absolute 

permeability was 0.073 mD +/-0.022 mD. This high porosity and low permeability can be 

explained as the result of small internal pores in the structure of the sample. On the other 

hand, due to the undamaged condition of the samples after the application of the high 

confinement pressure of 2400 psi, it was concluded that sample presented good 

consolidation. Additionally, grain density of this synthetic plug was calculated in order to 

compare the dolomite rocks value of 2.84 g/cm3 from literature (D.M.D., 2018). In this 

sense, it was found a grain density for this synthetic plug of 2.87 g/cm3, corroborating the 

similarity of the synthetic sample with the natural ones.

Based on the observed consolidation behavior of the samples due to the use of a 

unique particle size, it was studied the consolidation behavior of the samples due to the 

use of a combination of particle sizes. In this sense, samples with disk geometry was 

constructed with the proposed particle size ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 w/w), the finest 

(&lt;0.02:0.02-0.074 mm) and thickest (0.15-0.3:0.3-0.6 mm) particle sizes, 6% w/w of water 

content at pH 3 and drying temperature 100°C for 1 hour, using a uniaxial compression 

(200 kN; 25 mm/min) and without using additional bonding material. Figure 11 presents 

these resulting disks.  



 56 

From here, considering the same particle size mixture, it was evident that a higher 

proportion of fines led to a tendency to obtain better consolidated disks, seen with the 

ratio 1:1 (w/w) shown in Figure 11, 120 hours after removing from compression moulding. 

The use of a higher fine particle content favors material agglomeration, improving the 

consolidation of samples. Figures from appendix C presents all these constructed disks, 

demonstrating the same tendency.

To evaluate the wettability behavior due to different particle size ratios of these first 

disk samples, air-water and air-mineral oil contact angle measurements were carried out 

at times 0 and 10 seconds of the drop deposition. An example of these measurements is 

presented in Figure 12 for the disks with the finest (&lt;0.02 : 0.02-0.074 mm) and thickest 

(0.15-0.3 : 0.3-0.6 mm) particle sizes, using the particle size ratio 1:2, 6% w/w of water 

content at pH 3 and drying temperature 100°C, uniaxial compression (200 kN; 25 mm/min) 

without using additional bonding material and after 120 hours of the sample construction. 

For both water and oil drops, disks constructed with the finest particle size present 

a tendency to obtain higher contact angles at 0 seconds and decrease with the time. In 

contrast, disks constructed with the thickest particles, show water contact angle value of 

zero over time. Oil drops present greater contact angles and a slower contact angle 

decrease with time.

Probably, absorption of water by the sample influenced the measurement. A 

contact angle of zero was caused by this absorption instead of the spreading of the water 

drop. This is in contrast to the oil drop behavior in which no absorption was observed. 

From these preliminary results, such samples are not indicated as suitable to represent 

the wettability behavior of carbonate samples based on contact angle measurements, 

from a known intermediate to oil-wet behavior (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 2012; MANRIQUE 

et al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; AKKURT et al., 2000). It 

based to the known air-water contact angles, where a value lower than 55º is relative to a 

water-wet surface (GRATE et al., 2012). Figure from appendix D, presents all the contact 

angle measurements, showing this same tendency 

Subsequently to the contact angle measurements, water immersion tests were 

carried out on the preliminary disk samples. To this end, based on the presented results 

from Figure 11, the better consolidated disks were selected (particle sizes&amp;lt;0.02mm:0.02-

0.074mm, ratio 1:1, 6% w/w of water content at pH 3, drying temperature 100°C for 1 

hour, uniaxial compression (200 kN; 25 mm/min), without using additional bonding 

material). The disks were placed into a glass flask which was then filled with water. From 

there, as presented in Figure 13, it was noted that the previous proposed methodology to 

construct the samples does not guarantee the consolidation of the samples when 

immersed in a water medium, probably due to the lack of cementing of the particles. Due 

to this challenge, it was necessary to improve this consolidation methodology aiming for 

both better consolidation and stability in a water medium and wettability behavior closer 

to natural carbonates from a reservoir.

To this end, some bonding materials were selected to construct other disks using 

the same previously parameters (particle sizes&amp;lt;0.02mm:0.02-0.074mm, ratio 1:1, 6% 

w/w of water content at pH 3, drying temperature 100°C for 1 hour, uniaxial compression 

(200 kN; 25 mm/min), using additional bonding material with content of 5% and 10% w/w 

relative to the base material). The bonding materials used were slow setting gypsum 

powder, fast setting gypsum powder, amide wax of type N,N-bis-stearyl ethylenediamine 

powder and Stearic acid powder, following the content given in Table 4.2. Figure 14 shows 

the photographic register of these samples 120 hours after removing from compression 

moulding, where it was possible to observe a good consolidation, even during handling 

for all samples, except when using the two kinds of gypsum powder at 5% w/w content 

relative to the base material.

Disks constructed with Stearic acid and commercial amide wax were chosen to 

evaluate wettability. Results are presented in Figure 16. A tendency to generate higher 

contact angles for water was observed with both bonding materials, and not changes was 

observed to the oil. For commercial amide wax, higher water contact angles were obtained 

when using the higher (10%) content of bonding materials. To interpret these results, it is 

considered that an intermediate wettability is relative to air-water contact angles in the 

range of approximately 55º to 80º, while values lower than 55º or higher than 80º are 

relative to water-wet and oil-wet, respectively, as shown by Grate et al. (2012). In this 

sense, the obtained sample disks show an intermediate wetting behavior which is closer 

to the known intermediate and oil-wet carbonates from oilfields (PIZARRO; BRANCO, 

2012; MANRIQUE et al., 2004; MASALMEH et al., 2014; AL-DHAHLI et al., 2011; 

AKKURT et al., 2000).

That fact, in addition with the better consolidation of the samples observed in the 

previous step, justifies the use of bonding materials to construct synthetic plugs to 

reproduce wettability properties. Therefore, in order to use a minimum content of bonding 

material while keeping an intermediate wettability of the synthetic plug, commercial amide 

wax powder at 5% w/w was selected to construct real size plugs. 

Figure 17 presents a summary of the constructed plugs, using the finest (mm) 

&lt;0.02:0.02-0.074 and the thickest (mm) 0.150-0.3:0.3-0.6 particles sizes, particle sizes 

ratios 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 w/w, commercial amide wax powder at 5% w/w as a bonding 

material relative to the base material, 6% w/w of water content at pH 3, uniaxial 

compression (load 200 kN; 25 mm/min)  and drying temperature 100 °C for 1 hour. From 

these plugs was observed good consolidation for all the cases (3 ratios using thickest and 

finest particles sizes). In addition, samples did not present visual lateral surface scratches 

were not observed.

Given the previous findings, a final wettability study was developed in the samples 

obtained in the Figure 17 to observe contact angle changes due to the mixture of particle 

size and commercial amide wax powder. Figure 18 presents these results. A tendency to 

obtain greater contact angles from water drops compared with oil drops was observed, 

probably due to the presence of the organic character of the bonding material. In addition, 

in comparison with the plugs constructed without bonding material, water contact angles 

for both particle mixtures decreased slowly with time, indicating slower water absorption 

due to the presence of the commercial amide wax powder. 

Plugs constructed with the thickest particles show water contact angle greater than 

ones with the finest particles. In this study, different visual surface roughness was 

observed relative to the particle size used to construct them, i.e. the more roughness was 

observed when using the thickest particles sizes. Alotaibi (2010) explains that solid 

surface will affect the contact angle due to the roughness and heterogeneity of the solid 

surface. In this sense, further studies relating surface roughness of the constructed plugs 

and contact angles need to be developed.

Regarding the petrophysical properties, as will be shown later (Figure 19 and Table 

5.2), it was selected 8 of the 30 synthetic plugs construction condition, based on the 

particle size and particle size ratio. These plugs were analyzed in duplicate in order to 

study the reproducibility of the petrophysical properties. Additionally, one of the selected 

samples were constructed without using commercial amide wax as bonding material to 

study its influence on petrophysical measurements. 

 Figure 19 presents these synthetic plugs, and the geometry of these plugs 

(diameter and height) and mass were measured in triplicate and resultant values

Grain density of the synthetic plugs were measured by gas and mercury 

porosimetry and are presented in the Table 5.3. It is expected that the main contribution 

to the grain density of the synthetic plugs corresponded to the base material used to 

construction. Thus, the expected grain density corresponds to the related in the literature 

for dolomite rocks 2,84 g/cm3 (D.M.D., 2018). Due to the low density of the wax, synthetic 

plugs using bonding material showed lower grain density in comparison with the one 

constructed without it. This expected behavior was confirmed with the resultant grain 

densities by gas and mercury porosimetry, where samples with bonding material shows 

an average of 2,64 and 2,62 g/cm3, and sample without bonding material (P10) of 2,87 

and 2,84 g/cm3, respectively. 

Table 5.3 presents the theoretical (item 4.3.5) and experimental petrophysics 

results obtained by gas and mercury porosimetry and its relative error, based on the 

theoretical value. From here, based on the theoretical porosity calculated for synthetic 

plugs with bonding material, it was observed expected values from 12.99% to 19.88% for 

particle size ratio 1:1 and 12.41% to 18.31% for particle size ratio 1:3. In this sense, it was 

not observed evidences of relationship between porosity and the particle size ratios.  



 70 

Subsequently, a tendency to the decreasing of porosity with the decrease of 

particle sizes used to construct the synthetic plugs was observed. Considering the 

previously explained calculus, theoretical porosity has a direct relationship with the 

volume of the sample and grain density. In this sense, considering that all the constructed 

synthetic plugs have a similar grain density, the calculated porosity was influenced by the 

observed decreasing heights (Table 5.2) with the increasing of the particle size. It due to 

the packing of the particles used to construct the synthetic plugs. In this way, the largest 

the particle size, the higher the difference of size between particles. It causes a better 

pack of the smaller particles into the empty spaces between the larger particles, thus 

reducing the bulk volume occupied by the particles. Additionally, it is important to mention 

that comparing the synthetic plugs with and without (P10) bonding material, it was 

observed that maximum porosities are obtained in the absence of the commercial amide 

wax, with a value of 19,71%, probably because the bonding material is not entering into 

the pore spaces of the plug. 

To generate a better understand of the pore structure and therefor porosities and 

permeabilities, the correlation between experimental tests were discussed following.  

Based in the observed tendency of theoretical porosity, it was analyzed the 

experimental petrophysical results obtained from gas and mercury porosimetry. The same 

tendency to decrease porosity with the decreasing of particle sizes used to construct the 

synthetic plugs was observed for the experimental test. In this way, porosities of the 

constructed plugs with bonding materials was found from 10.43% to 17.23% and 10.32% 

to 14.67% for particle size ratio 1:1 and 1:3 w/w respectively, based on the gas 

porosimetry and values and values from 11.27% to 19.96% and 11.39% to 15.36% for 

particles size ratios 1:1 and 1:3 w/w respectively, based on the mercury porosimetry. 

Additionally, it was observed higher relative errors from the gas porosimetry compared to 

the mercury porosimetry. It can be due probably to the higher intrusion pressure applied 

by the mercury porosimetry than gas porosimetry, allowing the identification of smaller 

pore sizes.  

On the other hand, based on the permeability results obtained by the two 

experimental techniques, it was observed a tendency to increase permeabilities with the 



 71 

increasing of particle size, contrary to the found for the porosity. To explain these 

behaviors, pore size distribution was studied.

Pore size distribution was studied using the mercury porosimetry by cumulative 

mercury injection volume with gradual increasing pressures. Figure 20 presents the 

resulted pore size distribution of samples constructed using bonding materials and particle 

size ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 w/w. It demonstrates that most pore size lay in the in the micro-

range of 0.01-10 µm. From this result, it was observed in the two particle size ratios 

increases of the pore size distribution with the increasing of the particles size used to 

construct the synthetic plugs. This pore size behavior, in addition with the found porosities 

and permeabilities, can be explained by:  the previously mentioned packing of the particles 

and the accessibility to previously closed pores into the particles due to the reduction of 

the particle size. In this sense, these two factors may be causing the increasing of porosity,

On the other hand, in order to get detailed understanding of the internal distribution 

of the bonding material in the synthetic plugs, one sample were examined by SEM. In this 

way, it was selected a plug from Figure 19 with the thickest particle size 0.15-0.3:0.3-0.6 

mm, particle size ratio 1:1 w/w, commercial amide wax powder at 5% w/w as a bonding 

material relative to the base material, 6% w/w of water content at pH 3, uniaxial 

compression (load 200 kN; 25 mm/min)  and drying temperature 100 °C for 1 hour. From 

this sample, a sub sample were extracted as shown in Figure 4 to acquire the SEM 

images.  

The microchemical analyses of the acquired images by backscattered electron and 

secondary electron are presented in the Figure 21. From this analyzes, in the part a of the 

Figure 21, it was selected four points based on different density and atomic number.  

The lower the density and atomic number, the higher the gray-black color in the 

acquired image. As expected, from points 1, 2 and 4 selected in the part a of the Figure 

21, it was observed higher content of calcium, magnesium and oxygen, fact that represent 

the nature of the dolomitic carbonate used as base material to construct the synthetic 

plugs. Additionally, the point 3 presented the material with lower atomic number. The 

higher content of carbon on this point, may be due to the nature of the commercial amide 

wax used to construct the plugs, in addition to the epoxy resin in a porous area. In addition, 

it was focusing the area where probably bonding material is located. Figure 21 the part b, 

present this characterization. From here, it was observed the presence of chlorine at point 

2, which may be related to the epoxy resin where the sample as embedded, whereas in 

the point 1 it was not identified, corroborating the presence of the wax and epoxy resin in 

a porous area. Additionally, based on the acquired image it was observed the probably 

presence of voids in this same porous area that may represent porous into the bonding 

material.

Acquisition images from micro tomography were carried out in order to observe the 

internal distribution of the particle rocks and bonding material into the samples. Two 

samples were selected from the manufactured in the Figure 19: samples constructed with 

the finest (&lt;0.02:0.02-0.074 mm) and the thickest (0.15-0.3:0.3-0.6 mm) particle sizes, 

particle size ratio 1:1 w/w, commercial amide wax powder at 5% w/w as a bonding material 

relative to the base material, 6% w/w of water content at pH 3, uniaxial compression (load 

200 kN; 25 mm/min)  and drying temperature 100 °C for 1 hour. From these samples, sub 

samples were extracted as shown in the Figure 4 to acquire the micro-CT images.   

 The acquired images from this technique are presented in the Figure 22. From the 

processing of the acquired images from the micro-CT, it was separated the two 

conformant elements of the synthetic plugs: the disintegrated rock and the bonding 

material. Based on the previous SEM analyses, it was adopted that the first is in grayscale 

and the latter in color blue. From here, it was observed homogeneous distribution of the 

bonding material in the samples with coarse particles size and larger conglomerates in 

the samples with the finest particle. Probably, it occurs due to the packing of the rock 

particles causing different distributions of the bonding material. From another approach, 

this evidence may be caused due to a poor mixture of the used elements to construct the 



 76 

synthetic plugs. In this sense, it could be improved with the enhancing of the preparing 

methodology to construct synthetic plugs, specifically when used finest particle sizes.

This study demonstrates the promising construction of carbonate synthetic plugs 

as an alternative to the well-known difficulty of obtaining reservoir plugs samples as well 

as the importance of synthetic plugs to understand reservoir behavior. The following 

approach was made to contribute to the construction of further samples.  

Gas porosimetry results were selected to be plotted versus a combination of 

particle size, represented by the numbers 1 to 4: 1.&amp;lt;0.02 mm : 0.02-0.074 mm; 2. 0.02-



 77 

0.074 mm : 0.074 – 0.15 mm; 3. 0.074-0.15 mm : 0.15-0.3 mm; 4. 0.15-0.3 mm : 0.3-0.6 
mm and particle size ratio 1:1 w/w (Figure 23) and 1:3 w/w (Figure 24). These 

petrophysical results were chosen because it allows to evaluate the synthetic plug of real 

size. In this sense, the obtained petrophysical results by gas porosimetry may represent 

a more faithful measurement of the whole volume.  

The following procedure was constructed to use Figure 23 and Figure 24, in order 

to manufacture the synthetic carbonate plugs:  

1. Select a petrophysical property to be reproduced by the synthetic plugs: 

porosity or permeability. 

2. Select a value of porosity or permeability value to be reproduced. 

3. Identify the selected porosity or permeability value in the graphs of particle 

size of ratio 1:1 w/w or 1:3 w/w. 

4. Once the value is identified on the y axis, observe the associated value 

corresponding to the x axis. 

5. Use the Table 5.4 to obtain the combination of particles size to be used in 

the construction of the synthetic plugs.

6. Use the proposed combination of particle size in the construction of 

synthetic plugs. Note: The ratio to combinate this particle size is relative to the graph used 

in the step 3.  

7. Construct the synthetic plugs using the disintegrated carbonate rock matrix 

with the particle sizes and particle size ratios, water content of pH 3 (6% w/w relative to 

the base material), commercial amide wax as bonding material (5% w/w relative to the 



 78 

base material), drying temperature of 100C for 1 hour, and uniaxial compaction with 

controlled load foarce (200kN) and velocity (25 mm/min).

6 CONCLUSIONS 
 

In this study, consolidated synthetic carbonate plugs were obtained using 

disintegrated carbonate rock matrix with controlled particle sizes and particle size ratios, 

water content of pH 3 (6% w/w relative to the base material), commercial amide wax as 

bonding material (5% w/w relative to the base material), drying temperature of 100ºC for 

1 hour, and uniaxial compaction with controlled load force (200kN) and velocity (25 

mm/min).The approach of construct disk samples was useful for the screening of the 

different parameters before the construction of the real size plugs.  

Generally, it was observed that the porosity and permeability features of the 

synthetic plugs were within the range of carbonate reservoirs. However, without 

reproducing a heterogeneous pore structure normally present in natural samples. On the 

other hand, wettability properties of the resulted synthetic plugs were similar to the natural 

carbonate plugs.  

Regardless the porous heterogeneous structure of natural carbonate samples, an 

attempt to relate particle size and petrophysical characteristics of the synthetic plugs was 

presented. In this sense, synthetic carbonate plugs can be reproduced correlating a 

disintegrated carbonate rock matrix. 

Considering the limitations of the existing methodologies to construct synthetic 

carbonate plugs, the presented methodology demonstrates a promising way to be 

explored in order to generate further studies to understand carbonate oilfields. This 

promising result makes viable the construction of synthetic carbonate plugs and the use 

of this samples in laboratory tests where petrophysical properties of the sample are not a 

concern, which is not the case of core flooding tests.

7 FUTURE WORKS 
 

With the purpose of construct a more representative plug similar to the natural 

ones, a combination of methodologies to generate heterogeneous pore structures and 

higher petrophysics properties should be explored. Additionally, it is suggested to use 

drilling cuttings from carbonate reservoirs as base material to construct synthetic plugs.  

On the other hand, the constructed carbonate plugs should be compared with 

natural samples to evaluate the behavior of this synthetic samples in tests such as 

advanced petrophysics studies such as core flooding.
