Abstract 
 

The Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism is the most voluminous of the three 

cycles of magmatic activity that took place on the West Iberian Margin (WIM) during 

the Mesozoic. It was preceded by a tholeiitic cycle in the Early Jurassic (200-198 Ma) 

and by a transitional episode during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous transition (147-

142 Ma). 

The alkaline cycle took place in a post-rift setting, after oceanic break-up, and is 

contemporaneous of the opening of the Bay of Biscay and consequential 35º 

counterclockwise rotation of Iberia, as well as with the first phases of tectonic inversion 

in the Mesozoic Lusitanian and Algarve Basins, as a result of the onset of the 

convergence and collision between the Iberian, European and African plates. 

Onshore, this cycle includes the intrusive Sintra, Sines and Monchique igneous 

complexes, the extrusive Lisbon Volcanic Complex as well as several other minor 

intrusions scattered in the Lusitanian and Algarve basins, such as the Foz da Fonte  sill, 

the Paço d’Ilhas sill, the Mafra Radial dyke complex, the Oeiras Cascais dykes and the 

lamprophyre-basanite suite of the littoral Algarve. It extends offshore where it is 

represented by the Madeira-Tore Rise and the Ormonde peak in the Gorringe Bank. 

In this study, the geochronology of the Late Cretaceous onshore occurrences was 

updated through the acquisition of new U-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar, K-Ar and Rb-Sr. The 

combination of these data with previously published ages allowed to better constrain the 

duration of this cycle (94-72 Ma), as well as for the identification of two separate 

magmatic pulses.  

The first pulse took place between 94 and 88 Ma and is restricted to the Foz da 

Fonte and Paço d’Ilhas sills, both of which occur in the Lusitanian basin, between N39º 

and N38º20'. This pulse is contemporaneous with the opening of the Bay of Biscay and 

consequent rotation of Iberia (118-80 Ma). 

The second pulse has a younger age (75-72 Ma,) wider geographical 

distribution, between the Lisbon region (? 39ºN) and the Algarve (? 37ºN), and 

occurred simultaneously with the initial stages of the Alpine orogeny in the WIM, 

which culminated in the formation of the Betics and Pyrenees as well as to the inversion 

of the Mesozoic basins.  

The age obtained for the Sintra granite (79.2 Ma ± 0.8), is equivalent within 

error to the oldest age obtained for the syenite (78.3 ± 1.9 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987) 



 

2 
 

but older than the other K-Ar ages obtained for these rocks (76.4 ± 1.4 and 76.1 ± 1.1 

Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987) and for the gabbros (74.9 ± 1 Ma Storetvedt et al., 1987). 

The combination of the geochronological data with the observed field cross-cutting 

relations and geophysical data (gravimetry and AMS), appears to indicate that the Sintra 

granite corresponds to an older phase that was intruded by a more recent gabbro to 

syenite suite. 

Geochemical analysis of samples from both pulses revealed that these rocks 

derive from small degrees (1-6%) of partial melting of trace element enriched garnet 

peridotite sources, with fairly homogenous isotopic compositions reflecting low time-

integrated Rb/Sr and high Sm/Nd and U/Pb ratios, which are compatible with a sub-

lithospheric origin. However, there are clear differences in the trace element abundance 

patterns in rocks from the first and second pulses. Samples from the second pulse show 

negative K, Zr, Hf and sometimes even Ti anomalies, which are absent in the first pulse 

and that are probably related to a metasomatic event. The metasomatic agent is likely to 

correspond to a melt of carbonatitic to siliceous volatile (CO2+H2O) rich nature that 

promoted, for example the stability of a hydrated K rich phase such as amphibole. 

Amphibole is unstable at the temperatures that characterize the asthenosphere or mantle 

plumes and therefore the negative K anomalies should indicate interaction of the 

ascending sub-lithospheric magmas the metasomatized lithospheric mantle or melting of 

the latter. This metasomatic signature is more noticeable in the rocks which derived 

from smaller fractions of melting, becoming progressively diluted as melting degree 

increases. 

In terms of isotopic composition, no major differences are observed between the 

rocks of the second pulse, which show a clear metasomatic contribution, and the rocks 

of the first pulse which do not show such a signature. This indicates that the 

metasomatic agent probably originated from the same sublithospheric source which had 

earlier produced the magmas of the first pulse.  

The differences in trace element signatures between the two pulses created by 

this metasomatic episode can be related to their contemporaneous geodynamic context. 

During the first pulse, the rotation of Iberia created a stress regime favorable to quick 

magma ascent while from 80 Ma onwards, the onset of continental collision restricted 

the opening of fractures and magma ascent, favouring the interaction of the ascending 

magmas with the lithosphere, probably resulting in the metasomatism of the lithospheric 

mantle and the formation of amphibole during or previous to the second pulse. 



 

3 
 

Uncontaminated samples show isotopic signatures (87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; 

?Ndi 5.7–3.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-
39.00) that are distinct from the previous tholeiitic and transitional cycles and point 

towards a sublithospheric source, unlike the previous cycles, which show an important 

lithospheric contribution. These signatures are also very similar to the ones observed in 

the rocks derived from the melting of the Canaries mantle plume, which was located 

near the WIM during the Late Cretaceous, according to paleogeographic reconstitutions 

and paleomagnetic data, and is therefore considered the most likely source for the melts 

and metasomatic agents that were identified in this study. 

The large volume of magmatism that took place in the onshore and offshore 

WIM during the Late Cretaceous is also compatible with an origin from a deep seated 

hot mantle anomaly, such as a mantle plume. However, the differences between the 

volumes erupted onshore and offshore must be related to different lithospheric 

thicknesses in these two domains, since larger volumes of decompression melting are 

possible under the thinner oceanic and transitional lithospheres than under the thicker 

continental lithosphere. Also, the Iberian plate kinematics and pre-existing structure 

must have played a major role in controlling the timing and location of this magmatism, 

thus explaining the absence of a spatial age progression and the scattered location of the 

intrusive and extrusive features. 

Mineral chemistry data (e.g reverse zoning) indicates that magma mixing 

between liquids of basic/ultrabasic and intermediate natures took place at upper 

mantle/lower crustal depths but that does not seem to have greatly affected the 

composition of the resulting magmas. 

These magmas seem to have ascended to upper crustal levels by taking 

advantage of pre-existing fractures related with Mesozoic rifting and/or the Paleozoic 

Variscan orogeny. Many of these occurrences in the western Mesozoic basins seem to 

be related to WNW-ESE to E-W transfer faults that were active during rifting but, their 

exact location seems to be controlled by the intersection of these structures with other 

also previously existing fault systems with NE-SW and NNW-SSE orientations.  

After emplacement at upper crustal levels, the rocks from both pulses seem to 

have evolved through combined fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe-

Ti oxides and more or less plagioclase and amphibole, with assimilation of crustal 

lithologies. Fractionation and accumulation of some of these minerals led to specific 



 

4 
 

major and trace element characteristics of some of the intrusive rocks, such as the Sines 

and Sintra gabbros and the Paço d’Ilhas sill. 

Assimilation seems to have been an important factor in generating the observed 

petrological diversity and in creating the observed radiogenic Sr (87Sr/86Sri up to 

0.7049), unradiogenic Nd (?Ndi as low as 3.1) and variable Pb (206Pb/204Pbi and 
208Pb/204Pbi decrease to 18.827 and 38.603, respectively, while 207Pb/204Pbi increases up 

to 15.634) signatures seen in the more evolved rocks. Two different contamination 

trends are observed and thus require the existence of two different contaminants. 

Increasing Th/La, Zr/Nb, 87Sr/86Sr, 207Pb/204Pb and K/Nb and decreasing Nb/U, 
206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb towards values closer to crustal compositions with 

increasing SiO2 are related to contamination by a siliceous upper crustal lithology. The 

other trend is characterized by only increasing 87Sr/86Sr without causing significant 

changes in other isotopic ratios and is probably related to a Sr rich contaminant that is 

simultaneously depleted in Nd and Pb, which is likely to be of carbonated nature.

Resumo 
 

O magmatismo alcalino do Cretácico Superior constitui o mais volumoso dos 

três ciclos de actividade magmática que tiveram lugar na Margem Oeste Ibérica (MOI) 

durante o Mesozóico. Este ciclo alcalino foi antecedido por um de natureza toleítica 

durante o Jurássico Inferior (200-198 Ma) e outro de quimismo transicional durante o 

Jurásico Superior-Cretácico Inferior (147-142 Ma). 

O ciclo alcalino teve lugar num contexto pós-rifting, após o início da 

oceanização, contemporâneo da abertura do golfo da Biscaia e consequente rotação 

sinistrógira de 35º da Ibéria. Coincide também com as primeiras fases de inversão das 

bacias Mesozóicas do Algarve e Lusitaniana, que resultam da convergência rápida das 

placas Ibérica, Europeia e Africana, e que se inicia no final do Cretácico. 

Em terra, este ciclo encontra-se representado pelos complexos ígneos intrusivo 

de Sintra, Sines e Monchique, pelo Complexo Vulcânico de Lisboa, e por uma série de 

outras ocorrências de menor volume distribuídas pelas bacias Lusitaniana e do Algarve, 

como as soleiras da Foz da Fonte e de Paço d’Ilhas, o complexo filoniano radial de 

Mafra, os filões de Oeiras-Cascais e o magmatismo lamprofirico-basanitico do Algarve 

litoral, entre outras. Na parte imersa da margem este ciclo inclui a Crista Madeira-Tore, 

várias intrusões menores entre a montanha submarina de Tore e/no Esporão da 

Estremadura e o magmatismo do pico Ormonde no banco do Gorringe.  

A aquisição de novas datações U-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar, K-Ar e Rb-Sr permitiu a 

actualização da geocronologia das ocorrências da parte emersa desta província o que, 

em conjunto com dados previamente publicados, possibilitou um melhor 

constrangimento da sua duração, entre 94 e 72 Ma, e a detecção de dois pulsos 

independentes.  

O primeiro pulso teve lugar entre os 94 e os 88 Ma e está limitado às soleiras da 

Foz da Fonte e de Paço d’Ilhas, que se encontram na bacia Lusitaniana entre N39º e 

N38º20'. Este pulso é contemporâneo da abertura da baía da Biscaia e consequente 

rotação da Ibéria (124-80 Ma). 

O segundo pulso ocorreu entre os 75-72 Ma, tem uma distribuição geográfica 

mais abrangente entre a região de Lisboa (? 39ºN) e o Algarve (? 37ºN) e teve lugar 

durante as primeiras manifestações da orogenia Alpina na MOI, que culminou na 

inversão das bacias Mesozóicas e na formação das cadeias dos Pirinéus e das Béticas.

A idade obtida para o granito de Sintra (79.2 ± 0.8 Ma), é equivalente dentro do 

erro analítico à idade mais antiga adquirida para o sienito (78.3 ± 1.9 Ma, Storetvedt et 

al., 1987), mas no entanto é mais antigo que as restantes idades K-Ar obtidas para estas 

rochas (76.4 ± 1.4 e 76.1 ± 1.1 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987) e para os gabros (74.9 ± 1 

Ma Storetvedt et al., 1987). Esta informação, quando combinada com as relações de 

corte observadas entre os corpos intrusivos de diferentes naturezas e dados geofísicos 

adquiridos no maciço (gravimetria e ASM), parece indicar que o granito corresponde a 

um lacólito formado numa fase anterior de actividade que é por sua vez intruído por 

uma série magmática de natureza gabróica a sienítica. 

Análises geoquímicas de amostras de ambos os pulsos demonstram que estas 

rochas derivam de pequenas quantidades de fusão parcial (1-6%) de um peridotito 

granatífero ± anfíbola enriquecido em elementos incompatíveis e com uma assinatura 

isotópica relativamente homogénea, e compatível com fonte(s) mantélica(s) sub-

litosférica(s) carcterizada(s) por baixo Rb/Sr, e alto Sm/Nd e U/Pb, integrados no 

tempo..  

No entanto, existem diferenças importantes entre as rochas dos dois pulsos no 

que respeita aos padrões de elementos incompatíveis. As amostras do segundo pulso 

mostram anomalias negativas em K, Zr, Hf e por vezes Ti, que estão ausentes nas 

amostras que representam magmas não fraccionados do primeiro pulso. Estas anomalias 

estarão relacionadas com um evento metassomático que terá afectado o manto na região 

da MOI entre os dois pulsos. O agente metassomático é provavelmente de natureza 

carbonatítica a siliciosa rica em voláteis (CO2+H2O) que, entre outros efeitos terá 

promovido a estabilidade de anfíbola. A anfíbola não é uma fase estável às temperaturas 

que caracterizam a astenosfera ou as plumas mantélicas e como tal, a presença de 

anomalias negativas de K será indicativa da interacção dos magmas sub-litosféricos em 

ascensão com domínio(s) metassomatizado(s) da litosfera ou da fusão desses mesmos 

domínios. Esta assinatura metassomática é mais notória nas rochas derivadas de 

menores quantidades de fusão parcial, tornando-se progressivamente mais diluída com o 

aumento do grau de fusão. 

Não se observam variações sistemáticas na composição isotópica entre as rochas 

com uma contribuição metassomática evidente (2º pulso) e as que não apresentam esse 

componente (1º pulso), sugerindo que a litosfera metassomatizada terá herdado a 

assinatura isotópica e elementar do agente metassomático e que este agente 

provavelmente terá tido a mesma origem dos magmas sublitosféricos do primeiro pulso. 



 

7 
 

As diferenças nas abundâncias de elementos traço entre os dois pulsos terão sido 

então criadas por um episódio metassomático cuja ocorrência poderá estar relacionada 

com os diferentes contextos geodinâmicos vigentes durante cada pulso. Durante o 

primeiro pulso, a rotação da Ibéria terá eventualmente criado um campo de tensões 

favorável à abertura de fracturas e à ascensão rápida dos magmas, enquanto que a partir 

dos 80 Ma, o inicio da colisão entre as placas Ibérica, Africana e Europeia terá 

restringido a abertura de fracturas dificultando a ascensão magmática e favorecendo 

assim a interacção dos magmas em ascensão com a litosfera. 

Os magmas não contaminados do ciclo alcalino têm assinaturas isotópicas 

(87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7–3.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-
15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00) que apontam para uma fonte sublitosférica, distinta 

das dos ciclos toleítico e transicional que o precederam, e que apresentam uma clara 

contribuição litosférica. Estas composições isotópicas são também muito semelhantes às 

apresentadas pelas rochas derivadas da fusão da pluma das Canárias. Reconstituições 

paleogeográficas e dados de paleomagnetismo indicam que durante o Cretácico 

Superior a MOI estaria localizada nas proximidades da pluma das Canárias, que poderá 

portanto ser considerada a fonte provável para os magmas e agentes metassomáticos 

aqui identificados e estudados. 

O elevado volume de magmatismo produzido nas regiões imersa e emersa da 

MOI durante o Cretácico Superior é também compatível com uma origem a partir de 

uma anomalia quente e profunda como uma pluma mantélica. Neste contexto, as 

diferenças entre o volume de magma gerado em terra e na parte submarina devem estar 

relacionadas a diferenças na espessura litosférica entre estes dois domínios. A menor 

espessura litosférica na região imersa permitirá maiores quantidades de fusão parcial 

por descompressão do que na região emersa onde a litosfera será mais espessa, o que 

limita o volume de magma gerado. Adicionalmente, a cinemática da placa Ibérica e a 

estrutura pré existente deverá ter tido um papel fundamental no controlo da distribuição 

espacial e temporal deste magmatismo, o que explicar+a a localização dispersa das 

ocorrências magmáticas e a ausência de uma progressão espacial das idades neste 

episódio. 

Os dados de química mineral (e.g. zonamentos inversos) apontam para a 

ocorrência de mistura entre magmas de natureza básica/ultrabásica e intermédia a 

profundidades correspondentes ao manto superior ou crosta inferior, embora este evento 

não pareça ter afectado significativamente a composição dos magmas daí resultantes. 



 

8 
 

Estes magmas parecem ter ascendido até níveis correspondentes à crosta 

superior através de fracturas pré existentes herdadas do rifting Mesozóico e/ou da 

orogenia Varisca. Muitas das ocorrências nas bacias Mesozóicas ocidentais parecem 

relacionadas com falhas de transferência WNW-ESE a E-W que estiveram activas 

durante o rifting, ainda que a sua localização exacta pareça ter sido condicionada pela 

intersecção destas estruturas com outros sistemas de falhas pré existentes de direcção 

NE-SW a NNW-SSE. 

Após a instalação na crosta superior, as rochas de ambos os pulsos parecem ter 

evoluído através dos processos de cristalização fraccionada de olivina, clinopiroxena, 

óxidos de Fe-Ti e mais ou menos plagioclase e anfíbola, em conjunto com a assimilação 

de litologias crustais. A fraccionação e acumulação de alguns destes minerais levou à 

formação de cumulados com assinaturas elementares específicas, como as rochas 

gabróicas de Sintra e Sines e as diferentes litologias da soleira de Paço d’Ilhas. 

A assimilação crustal parece ter desempenhado um papel importante na geração 

da diversidade petrológica observada, sendo responsável pelas assinaturas com Sr 

radiogénico (87Sr/86Sri até 0.7049), Nd menos radiogénico (?Ndi até 3.1) e Pb variável 

(206Pb/204Pbi e 208Pb/204Pbi descem para 18.827 e 38.603, respectivamente, enquanto que 
207Pb/204Pbi sobe até 15.634) nas rochas mais evoluídas. Foram identificadas duas 

tendências evolutivas nas amostras estudadas que deverão corresponder a assimilação 

de dois contaminantes distintos. Um de natureza siliciosa supracrustal que explicará o 

aumento de Th/La, Zr/Nb, 87Sr/86Sr, 207Pb/204Pb e K/Nb e diminuição de Nb/U, 
206Pb/204Pb e 208Pb/204Pb para valores semelhantes aos de composições crustais com o 

aumento simultâneo de SiO2. Outro de provável natureza carbonatada, rico em Sr mas 

com concentrações baixas de Nd e Pb e que terá induzido aumento de 87Sr/86Sr, sendo 

que este não é acompanhado por modificações significativas em outras razões isotópicas 

ou elementares.

1. Objectives 
 
 
This study concerns the post rift Late Cretaceous alkaline intraplate magmatism 

of the West Iberian Margin. The work that culminated in this dissertation was integrated 

in the MAGMAFLUX (POCTI/CTA/48450/2002) project. 

The main objectives of this work were: i) the re-evaluation of the geochronology 

of the alkaline intrusions; ii) the understanding of the petrogenesis of the alkaline rocks; 

iii) to reach a better understanding between the deep lithospheric and/or asthenospheric 

and shallow crustal control of the origin and emplacement of the alkaline intrusions; iv) 

to evaluate the extent of the onshore alkaline magmatism in the Lisbon region towards 

the offshore along the Estremadura Spur. 

The re-evaluation of the geochronology of this magmatic event was carried out 

in order to improve its temporal resolution in the context of the evolution of Iberia 

during the Late Cretaceous. This was done by the acquisition of new ages using the U-

Pb, Ar-Ar, K-Ar and Rb-Sr isotopic dating methods on a series of whole rock and 

mineral separate samples.  

After careful sampling of representative lithologies of the main igneous Late 

Cretaceous alkaline features of the WIM, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data and elemental whole 

rock geochemistry, along with the chemical characterization of the major mineral 

phases, allowed for the characterization of the sources and processes that generated 

these magmas, together with those that controlled their evolution.  

The Fontanelas seamount was identified as one of the magnetic anomalies 

present between the Sintra complex and the Tore seamount based on inspection of 

multibeam bathymetry and offshore magnetic anomaly maps. The study of this 

seamount allowed for the understanding of the extension of the intraplate alkaline 

magmatism as far as 100 km offshore and at depths of 1500 m below sea level. 

All these data were integrated, along with previously published information on 

other Late Cretaceous alkaline occurrences in the region and concerning the 

geodynamic evolution of Iberia during this period, in a model that characterizes the 

tectono-magmatic evolution of the passive West Iberian Margin during the Late 

Cretaceous in a broader Iberian geodynamic context.

2. Introduction and geological setting 
 
 

The Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism (fig. 2.1) that took place in the 

emerged part of the West Iberian Margin (WIM) is materialized by the Sintra, Sines and 

Monchique subvolcanic complexes, the Lisbon Volcanic Complex (LVC), among other 

minor intrusions and has attracted the attention of both Portuguese (e.g. Costa and 

Machado, 1929; Assunção, 1937; Matos Alves, 1964; Palácios, 1985; Martins, 1991) 

and international (e.g. Kaiser, 1914; Rock, 1982, Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997) 

geologists since the 19th century. 

However, despite the abundant geochemical and mineralogical studies 

undertaken in the past decades (e.g.  Sintra – Matos Alves, 1964; Leal, 1990, 1991, 

Palácios et al., 1999; Sines – Canilho, 1972, Martins and Olivença 1998; Monchique – 

Rock, 1977, 1982; LVC – , Palácios, 1985), the characterization of the source(s) and 

geodynamic processes responsible for the genesis of this magmatism remains 

incomplete due to the scarcity of available isotopic data. The exception is the 

Monchique complex, for which an important isotopic dataset exists, allowing for the 

existence of reasonably well constrained genetic models (Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; 

Valadares, 2004). 

Recent studies in the Sintra complex based on structural geology, gravimetry 

and anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (Kullberg and Kullberg, 2000, Terrinha et 

al., 2003), detailed geological mapping of the Monchique complex (Clavijo and 

Valadares, 2003, Valadares, 2004) and anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility work 

made on dykes of the Mafra Radial Dyke Complex (Nogueira, 2008) have shed some 

light on the emplacement mechanisms of these intrusions. However, the level of 

understanding of these mechanisms regarding the other intrusions and their relationship 

with the observed chemical compositions is very limited, which combined with the 

aforementioned insufficiencies in terms of available geochemical data, renders the 

currently available models for the late Cretaceous geodynamical evolution of the West 

Iberian Margin rather incomplete.   

Meanwhile, in the immersed part of the WIM and neighbouring oceanic crust a 

series of additional seamounts of igneous, basic to intermediate, alkaline nature have 

been identified, studied, and likewise dated as Late Cretaceous. Among these are the 

Ormonde peak in the Gorringe Bank (Auzende et al., 1978, Cornen 1982, Bernard-



 

17 
 

Griffiths et al., 1997), as well as several seamounts of the Madeira-Tore Rise 

(Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006).  

 

 
Fig. 2.1: Map of the alkaline igneous occurrences in the West Iberian Margin.  

   

Furthermore, a series of magnetic anomalies forming a WNW-ESE alignment 

from the Sintra complex to the Tore seamount have been detected (e.g. Silva, 2000, fig. 



 

18 
 

2.18). These anomalies might correspond to further alkaline igneous activity. A 

dredging operation in the vicinity of one of these anomalies yielded an ankaramite that 

was dated with an age of 74 Ma (Mougenot, 1989). 

The Ampére and Coral Patch seamounts that bound the southern part of the 

Horseshoe Abyssal Plain are also of alkaline nature but are of Oligocene age 

(Matveyenkov et al., 1994 in Geldmacher et al., 2000).  

Nevertheless, the joint existence of both onshore and offshore alkaline igneous 

rocks during the Late Cretaceous that lack a clear spatial age progression has never been 

properly addressed and the relationship between them remains unknown.  

Although this event was included in very large provinces such as the Circum-

Mediterranean Cenozoic Anorogenic Igneous Province (Lustrino and Wilson, 2007) and 

the Peri-Atlantic Alkaline Pulse (Matton and Jébrak, 2009), both of which group rocks 

with very different locations and ages, the mechanisms for magma genesis provided by 

these authors are of general nature and do not take into account the geodynamic 

particularities of the Late Cretaceous in Iberia, which will be addressed in more detail in 

the section below. 

 

2.1 Iberia during the Cretaceous  

The beginning of the Mesozoic era was marked by the onset of tectonic 

extension in the Early Triassic which marked the end of the Paleozoic Variscan orogeny 

and the breakup of Pangea, resulting in rifting in the Algarve and Lusitanian basins (e.g. 

Pinheiro et al., 1996, Terrinha, 1998, Rasmussen et al., 1998, Kullberg, 2000).  

By the end of the Early Cretaceous both the Lusitanian and Algarve basins 

suffered their last rifting event. In the Lusitanian basin this event started in the Late 

Jurassic (Tithonian-Barremian) and is characterized by angular unconformities between 

the Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits and by a change from marine carbonate 

sedimentation to siliciclastic continental sedimentation (Rasmussen et al., 1998). This 

unconformity was caused by thermal uplift exceeding the isostatic subsidence induced 

by the lithospheric stretching during this rifting phase (Rasmussen et al., 1998). The last 

rifting event in the Algarve basin is probably of Albian age (Terrinha, 1998).  



 

19 
 

Rifting ended and was followed by oceanization and formation of oceanic crust 

in the WIM, with no evidence of significant syn-rift volcanism (Pinheiro et al., 1996), 

which classifies this margin as non volcanic (e.g. White and McKenzie, 1989).  

The most landward magnetic anomaly detected in the Tagus Abyssal Plain 

corresponds to M11, placing the onset of seafloor spreading at approximately 133 Ma, 

in Hauteverian times (Pinheiro et al., 1996). On the Iberian Abyssal Plain the first 

magnetic anomaly to be detected corresponds to M3, which places the beginning of 

oceanization at 126 Ma, in the Barremian (Pinheiro et al., 1996), while in the Galicia 

Banks region the beginning of seafloor spreading is dated by the breakup unconformity 

as late Aptian, near the Aptian/Albian, boundary around 112 Ma (Pinheiro et al., 1996).

et al., 2007.

However, it has been recently proposed that these first magnetic anomalies are 

not the result of ocean crust formation but of serpentinization of exhumed continental 

sublithospheric mantle during extension (Sibuet et al., 2007). In this model, the 

formation of oceanic crust started only in the J (M0-M3) anomaly, around 118-124 Ma 

and the last rifting phase lasted until the Aptian/Albian boundary (Sibuet et al., 2007). 

The Cretaceous in Iberia was also characterized by the opening of the Bay of 

Biscay, which started between magnetic anomalies M0 and M3 (118 Ma 124 Ma), 

ending in chron A33o (80 Ma, Campanian) (Sibuet et al., 2004). This subject is still 

under intense debate and several different models have been proposed. 

The formation of the Bay of Biscay resulted on a counter clockwise rotation of 

the Iberian plate of roughly 35º, first detected in paleomagnetic data collected by van 

der Voo (1969) who constrained it to having occurred between the Triassic and the Late 

Cretaceous. Galdeano et al. (1989) studied the paleomagnetic properties of sediments 

from the Lisbon area and proposed a counter clockwise rotation of 27º between the 

Hauteverian (136-130 Ma) and the Barremian (130-125 Ma), followed by a second 

rotation in the same sense of 14º from 110 Ma to today. Moreau et al. (1997) presented 

data collected in sedimentary rocks from the Algarve basin and identified one quick 

anticlockwise rotation phase of 22º during the Barremian. Paleomagnetic data from 

igneous rocks in continental Portugal collected by Márton et al. (2004) indicate a 

rotation of 26º in the same sense between the Toarcian (ca. 180 Ma) and the extrusion 

of the Lisbon Volcanic Complex (72 Ma, Ferreira and Macedo, 1979). Other data 

collected in igneous intrusions in Portugal and France by Storetvedt et al. (1987) show a 

40º counter clockwise rotation of Iberia between 90 and 75 Ma based on the K-Ar they 

obtained for the same intrusions and a second clockwise rotation of the same magnitude 

between the end of the Cretaceous and the present day, associated with compressive 

alpine tectonics. In two subsequent publications Storetvedt et al., (1990, 1999) detect a 

first 40º counter clockwise rotation phase between 90 and 75 Ma, followed by a rotation 

of 70º in the opposite sense in the Campanian (75Ma), these data are, however, hard to 

reconcile with geological observations. The most recently published paleomagnetic data 

limits the duration of the previously identified 35º anti clockwise rotation to the Aptian 

(125-112 Ma, Gong et al., 2008), with that rotation progressing at a faster rate during 

the early Aptian relatively to the rest of that age. 

Despite some spread, most paleomagnetic data seems to point to an 

approximately 35º rotation centered around the Barremian and Aptian.

Fig. 2.3: Evolution of the Iberian plate during the Cretaceous. From Rosembaum et al., 2002. 

 

During the opening of the Bay of Biscay, extension comes to an end in the 

existent sedimentary basins in Pyrenean region while new basins are formed in a 

transtensional regime due to the left strike-slip movement between the Iberian and 

Eurasian plates along the North Pyrenean fault (Sibuet et al., 2004). Contemporaneously 

to this movement metamorphic and magmatic events took place in the pull-apart basins 

resulting in the incorporation of lherzolitic mantle material and intrusion of small 

igneous bodies in the previously mentioned basins between 105 and 85 Ma (Fabriès et 

al., 1998; Montigny et al., 1986). Also, in the Catalan ranges the small volume alkaline 

magmatism occurred between 82 and 69 Ma (Solé et al., 2003), while in Galicia rare 

dykes of similar age (96-87 Ma, Ancochea et al., 1992) have been identified. In the 

Basque-Cantabrian basin, alkaline pillow lavas sills and stocks are intercalated with 

sediments of Late Cretaceous age (Upper Albian-Santonian) and appear to be related 

with an extensional episode in the same basin (Carracedo et al., 1992).

Late Cretaceous. Notice the uplift and exposure of the bloc south of the Nazaré fault contemporaneously

23 
 

In the western Bay of Biscay - Cantabrian region, subduction took place between 

the Campanian and the Miocene (Sibuet et al., 2004), while in the Pyrenees, subduction 

ensued in two different phases, from the Aptian to the Santonian in the south and from 

the Campanian to the Miocene, in the north (Sibuet et al., 2004).  

After oceanic break up and for the remainder of the Lower Cretaceous, the 

Lusitanian basin went through a phase of generalised subsidence caused by the thermal 

relaxation of the lithosphere, resulting in fault controlled fluvial sedimentation. During 

the Early Cretaceous-Late Cretaceous transition, a generalized marine transgression 

promoted the deposition of carbonates until the end of the Cenomanian when it was 

interrupted by the uplift of the crustal block limited by the Nazaré and Arrábida faults 

(fig. 2.4, Proença da Cunha and Pena dos Reis, 1995; Dinis et al., 2008). 

This uplift, which is contemporaneous with the installation of the Sintra igneous 

complex and the extrusion of the Lisbon Volcanic Complex, is thought to be the cause 

of the erosion of approximately 300m of Cretaceous sediments inferred from the 

comparison between the thickness of onshore and offshore deposits (Rasmussen et al., 

1998).  

The tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic Lusitanian and Algarve basins started as 

early as the Late Cretaceous, as a consequence of the onset of rapid collision and even 

subduction between the Iberian, Eurasian and African plates (Mougenot, 1980; 

Terrinha, 1998, Rosembaum et al., 2002) but reached its climax during the Miocene in 

the Lusitanian Basin and offshore WIM (Ribeiro et al., 1990, Kullberg et al., 2000, 

Neves et al., 2009). However, the Algarve Basin experienced the compressive effects of 

the Africa-Iberia convergence mainly during the latest Cretaceous through Oligocene-

Early Miocene times (Terrinha, 1998).  

Meanwhile, central Iberia was affected by thermal metamorphism events that 

resulted in the formation  of hydrothermal Hg deposits in the Iberian Ranges (Espadán 

deposits) dated around 85 Ma (Tritlla and Solé, 1999) and low degree thermal 

metamorphism in the Cameros basin, which occurred between 105 and 86 Ma (Casquet 

et al., 1992 in Casas-Sainz and Gil-Imaz, 1998). 

Moreover, the WIM was the locus of important magmatic activity of transitional 

and alkaline affinities during the Cretaceous. The transitional magmatism took place 

within the Lusitanian basin and is commonly associated with diapiric structures 

(Martins, 1991) and spans from the latest Jurassic to the earliest Cretaceous (147-141 



 

24 
 

Ma, Grange et al., 2008; Alves, 2010). This event has been attributed to the melting of 

metasomatized mantle during a phase of high lithospheric thinning associated with the 

ongoing rifting and is characterized by relatively high 87Sr/86Sr and low 206Pb/204Pb and 
207Pb/204Pb (87Sr/86Sri 0.704441–0.706462; ?Ndi 3.2-0.6; 206Pb/204Pb 18.418–18.978; 

207Pb/204Pb 15.594–15.925, Grange et al., 2008; Alves et al., 2010).  

The Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism, represented by the igneous rocks 

mentioned earlier (see fig. 2) is the main subject of this dissertation and will be 

thoroughly described and discussed later in this work. 

Although the conjugate West Iberian and Newfoundland margins are commonly 

used as examples of amagmatic margins that suffered non volcanic rifting (e.g. White 

and McKenzie, 1989), a series of small intrusions of Cretaceous age have been 

identified on the stretched and faulted lithosphere present on the offshore WIM, in 

peridotite ridges in the Galicia banks and the Iberian Abyssal plain, and also in the 

Gorringe bank (e.g. Auzende et al., 1978; Boilot et al., 1989; Beslier et al., 1990; Malod 

et al., 1993; Schärer et al., 1995; Cornen et al., 1999; Schärer et al., 2000; Beard et al., 

2002; Chazot et al., 2005). 

The peridotites outcropping in the ridges are interpreted as being part of 

exhumed subcontinental lithospheric mantle that has experienced depletion during 

several previous melt extraction events during the Variscan (e.g. Malod et al., 1993; 

Cornen et al., 1999; Chazot et al., 2005). They are intruded by late gabbros and dolerites 

and can be locally covered by tholeiitic lavas that extruded between the end of rifting 

and the high temperature deformation of the peridotite (e.g. Auzende et al., 1978; 

Beslier et al., 1990; Boilot et al., 1989; Schärer et al., 1995; Schärer et al., 2000; Beard 

et al., 2002; Chazot et al., 2005).  

This magmatic episode lasted from 138 to 121 Ma (U-Pb ages in zircon 

separates, Schärer et al., 2000) and should have preceded continental breakup, with the 

younger rocks being found in the North and the older ones in the South. These rocks 

derived mostly from the melting of an asthenospheric, MORB like, LILE (Large Ion 

Lithophile Element) depleted source, according to their Hf and Nd isotopic signature, 

but with the lower ?Nd values probably being an indication of the involvement of a less 

LILE depleted lithospheric component (?Hf  20.5 – 14.0, ?Nd 10.3 – 3.6 Schärer et al., 

1995, 2000).  



 

25 
 

The gabbroic pegmatites found in the peridotite ridges of the Iberian abyssal 

plain and studied by Beard et al. (2002) systematically show a more enriched trace 

element and isotopic signature (?Ndi 4.7 – 4.9; 87Sr/86Sri 0.70362 - 0.70463; 206Pb/204Pbi 

18.65, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.48, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.3) and are thought to represent melts generated 

in the upper lithospheric mantle, probably at shallow depths, in the plagioclase stability 

field during the rifting and unroofing of these peridotites. These tholeiitic MORB-like 

melts are also considered to be responsible for the syn-rift metasomatic event that 

affected the subcontinental lithosphere peridotites and refertilized previously depleted 

hazburgites by interacting with them and creating different, enriched trace element and 

isotopic signatures. These signatures are also observed on the previously described 

intrusives contemporary with rifting, which also show evidence for interaction with the 

refertilized lithospheric mantle (Chazot et al., 2005).  

The clinopyroxene and amphibole separates from lherzolites in the Galicia bank 

have isotopic signatures characterized by radiogenic Nd and unradiogenic Sr 

(143Nd/144Nd 0.512804 – 0.513402 87Sr/86Sr 0.702100 - 0. 703887), while pyroxenes 

from the websterites in the Iberia Abyssal Plain have lower Nd isotopic compositions 

(143Nd/144Nd 0.512283 – 0.512553) with higher Sr isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr 0.704170 – 

0.705919) indicating the existence of Cretaceous metasomatic events with different 

natures in these two regions (Chazot et al., 2005).

2.2 Magmatism in the conjugate and Newfoundland margin 

The Newfoundland margin constitutes the conjugate margin of the WIM and 

separated from it during the aforementioned rifting process. It encompasses the 

Mesozoic Jeanne d’Arc, Carson, and Salar-Bonnition basins, and is also a non volcanic 

(i.e. free of any significant thickness of volcanic rocks or magmatic underplating, e.g. 

Tucholke and Sibuet, 2007). As in the WIM, peridotite ridges are present in this margin, 

with the difference that the Newfoundland peridotites (hazburgites) are more depleted 

relative to the ones found in the WIM, due to pre-rift melting events that possibly took 

place in an arc-like environment during a previous orogeny (Müntener and Manastchal, 

2006). 
 

 

Fig. 2.6: Reconstitution of the positions of Iberia and the Newfoundland/Grand Banks region at the time 

of anomaly M0 (approximately 118-124 Ma). From Tucholke and Sibuet., 2007. Also shown is the 

structure and sedimentary basins of the region as well as the position of the Newfoundland (NFLD) and 

Tore seamounts. Ages of the oceanic basement, seamounts and sills are from Sullivan and Keen (1977), 

Pe-Piper et al., 1994; Hart and Blusztajn (2006). 

 

Small volume, post-rift alkaline magmatism also took place in this margin and is 

represented by a series of alkaline sills recently drilled in Site 1276 of Leg 210 of the 

Ocean Drilling Program (Karner and Shillington, 2005; Hart and Blusztajn, 2006). They 

are constituted by more or less altered alkali basalts and hawaiites that intruded between 



 

27 
 

105 and 98 Ma (fig. 2.6) and are enriched in incompatible elements. Their isotopic 

composition (87Sr/86Sr 0.705898 - 0.706259, 143Nd/144Nd 0.512740 – 0.512598, 
206Pb/204Pb 18.4666 - 20.5031, 207Pb/204Pb 15.5536 - 15.6686, 208Pb/204Pb 37.8681 - 

38.4478; Hart and Blusztajn, 2006) suggests the participation of enriched mantle 

components in the genesis of these rocks, as well as a possible crustal contribution. This 

enriched mantle component may derive from preferential melting of enriched mantle 

domains embedded in depleted MORB mantle or reflect the activity of a mantle plume 

in the region that may as well be responsible for the formation of the Milne seamounts 

further east of this location (Hart and Blusztajn, 2006).  

 The Newfoundland seamounts correspond to chain of submarine volcanic peaks 

that positions itself East of the Newfoundland margin. They were extruded in an area 

which during magnetic anomaly M0 (118-124 Ma) was separated from the Tore 

seamount by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, according to paleogeographic reconstructions (e.g. 

Tucholke and Sibuet, 2007; Müntener and Manastchal, 2006; Sibuet et al., 2007; fig. 

2.6). The data available on these seamounts is scarce but it is known they are constituted 

by alkaline basalts and trachytes that were dated around 98 Ma (Sullivan and Keen, 

1977 in Pe-Piper et al., 2007). Little else is known about these seamounts except for 

their ?Ndi value of 4.1 (Sullivan and Keen, 1977 in Pe-Piper et al., 2007) and that they 

have low radiogenic Pb values (Pe-Piper et al., 1994). 

 Also present in oil exploration wells near this area is an Early Cretaceous 

alkaline bimodal suite (135-127 Ma) that is genetically related to the Grand Banks 

Jurassic transform margin (Pe-Piper et al., 1994). Trace element and isotopic signatures 

of the more basic magmas (87Sr/86Sri 0.70350 - 0.70388, 143Nd/144Nd 0.51263 – 

0.51282, 206Pb/204Pb 18.538 - 18.752, 207Pb/204Pb 15.598 - 15.636, 208Pb/204Pb 38.505 - 

38.674) suggest that they were generated by melting of the continental lithosphere 

induced by extensional decompression mechanisms along the reactivated transform 

margin. A plume component is also detected in their isotopic signature and a thermal 

anomaly related to this possible plume could have supplied the extra heat that allowed 

for the initiation of melting (Pe-Piper et al., 1994). Major faults in the region acted as 

magma conduits, and the rocks further away from the continental margins display 

stronger signs of crustal contamination (Pe-Piper et al., 1994), perhaps due to stronger 

interaction with the crust during magma transport. 

 The southern limit of this margin corresponds to the Newfoundland-Azores-

Gibraltar fracture zone, on top of which sit the Fogo seamounts of Late Jurassic to Early 



 

28 
 

Cretaceous age (154-130 Ma, Pe-Piper et al., 2007, Fig. 2. 6). This seamount chain is 

constituted by both tholeiitic and alkaline rocks who are thought to have formed from 

magmas generated by decompression melting from ascending asthenosphere as a result 

of edge-controlled convection in the upper mantle due to thermal and density gradients 

at the transform transition between the spreading ocean and the continental block of the 

Grand Banks (Pe-Piper et al., 2007). Pe-Piper et al. (2007) also suggested that thermal 

effects of the volcanism promoted mid-crustal partial melting and detachment faulting 

on the Grand Banks and consequentially the development of the asymmetric Grand 

Banks–Iberia rift system.  

 

2.3 Late Cretaceous Alkaline magmatic occurrences in the West 

Iberian Margin: the state of the art 

The Late Cretaceous igneous alkaline activity is the most important Mesozoic 

magmatic event in the WIM in terms of both area and volume. This magmatic activity, 

initially established as having occurred between 100 Ma and 70 Ma, was included in the 

4th cycle of Meso-Cenozoic magmatic activity in Portuguese territory by Ferreira and 

Macedo (1979). Previous cycles of alkaline with shoshonitic affinities (235-205 Ma), 

tholeiitic (ca. 200 Ma) and transitional (ca. 135 Ma) magmatism were proposed by the 

same authors.  

As was previously mentioned Rock (1982) grouped the Portuguese Late 

Cretaceous alkaline magmatism along with other occurrences of similar age and 

composition located around the Pyrenees in the Iberian Late Cretaceous Alkaline 

Igneous Province and argued for a close relation between this magmatism and the 

opening of the North Atlantic. Martins (1991) integrated the same alkaline episode in 

the third and last cycle of Mesozoic magmatic activity in Portugal, associating it with 

the ascent and melting of asthenospheric mantle as a consequence of the thinning of 

lithospheric mantle occurred during the various rifting phases of the WIM. Occurrences 

related to the first two cycles defined by Martins (1991) display tholeiitic and 

transitional affinities (Martins, 1991; Martins et al., 2008; Grange et al., 2008) and ages 

around 200 Ma (e.g. Dunn et al., 1998, Verati et al., 2007) and 130-146 Ma (Ferreira 

and Macedo, 1979; Grange et al., 2008), respectively. 



 

29 
 

Onshore, the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle includes subvolcanic complexes of 

Sintra, Sines and Monchique, the Lisbon Volcanic Complex and several other minor 

intrusions, such as the Foz da Fonte and Paço d’Ilhas sills, the Mafra radial dyke 

complex, the Oeiras-Cascais dykes and the lamprophyre-basanite suite of the Algarve 

coast (fig. 2.14). These rocks are discontinuously exposed between parallels 39º N and 

37º N and cover an area of approximately 325 km2 (fig. 2.8). The Sintra, Sines and 

Monchique intrusions are aligned along a NNW-SSE direction, which coincides with 

the trend shown by some rift faults as well as some Variscan structures. 

All the alkaline rocks in the Lisbon area, i.e. north of 38.5ºN, were emplaced 

within the Mesozoic Lusitanian rift basin. The Sines complex sits just east of the 

boundary of the Alentejo Basin and in the southern limit of the small Mesozoic 

Santiago do Cacém basin. The Monchique nepheline syenites were emplaced well into 

the non-rifted Paleozoic basement, while a complex of the coeval dykes and necks were 

mapped and dated in the Algarve rift basin (fig. 2.8). 

The alignment of the Sintra, Sines and Monchique Late Cretaceous alkaline 

complexes has been a matter of intense debate in the past. Ribeiro et al. (1979) 

suggested the complexes were emplaced along a dextral strike-slip fault during the 

rotation of Iberia. Mougenot (1980) proposed that these intrusions were emplaced along 

crustal pull-apart strain domains between en echelon faults during tectonic inversion of 

the WIM. Terrinha (1998) and Kullberg (2000) demonstrated the existence of Early-

Middle Jurassic age sin-rift faults along the lineament and proposed that these faults 

controlled the magma ascent in the Late Cretaceous, while decompression melting in 

releasing bends on the deep structure allowed for the melt generation (fig. 2.7).  

In recent times, offshore alkaline magmatic activity has been identified in 

thinned continental or oceanic crust between 34.5º N and 39º N between the Tore and 

Lion seamounts in the Madeira-Tore Rise (MTR) and the Ormonde seamount in the 

Gorringe Bank, totalling a much larger area and volume than its onshore counterpart 

(e.g. Cornen, 1982; Féraud et al., 1982; Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006). 

The relationship between the onshore and offshore occurrences is highly 

debated, with Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997) first proposing a consanguinity relation 

between the Monchique Massif and the alkaline magmatism of the Gorringe bank, 

which in turn served as the basis for the proposal that Monchique would represent the 

oldest known activity of the Madeira hotspot made by Geldmacher and Hoernle (2000).

magmas that constitute the Sintra igneous complex. From Terrinha et al., 2003. 
 

This author later proposed that all the observed magmatism in the offshore WIM 

could be explained by the activity the Madeira and Canaries hotspots and their 

interaction with the late Cretaceous mid Atlantic Ridge (Geldmacher et al., 2006, figs. 

2.15, 2.16). Merle et al. (2006, 2009) proposed that the Madeira-Tore seamounts would 

be the result of a long lived and wide mantle thermal anomaly present in the region 

during the Cretaceous that emitted several magmatic pulses. The space–time 

distribution of this magmatism results from the interaction between these pulses and the 

complex kinematics of the Iberian plate (Merle et al., 2009). 

In his turn, Ribeiro (2002) proposed that the onshore portion of this magmatic 

event could be related to a fracture resulting from a meteorite impact occurred in the 



 

31 
 

Late Cretaceous, whose crater corresponds to the Tore seamount, but further studies of 

this location do not support this hypothesis (Merle et al., 2006, 2009). 

Recently, Solé et al. (2003) proposed that the magmatism assigned to the Late 

Cretaceous Alkaline Igneous Province of Iberia had been generated by decompression 

and intruded the margins of the Iberian plate, where thinning and cortical relaxation had 

taken place during its rotation and contemporaneous opening of the Bay of Biscay. 

Despite their older age, Lustrino and Wilson (2007) included these occurrences in 

the Circum-Mediterranean Cenozoic Anorogenic Igneous Province and suggested that 

they could be related to the existence of small passive convective diapiric instabilities in 

the upper mantle where enriched magmas would ascend. These diapiric instabilities 

would lead to the rise of asthenospheric mantle with a similar composition in the entire 

region, which is known as the Common Mantle Reservoir (CMR) which represents a 

sublithospheric mantle domain enriched by the recycling of lithospheric material during 

subduction or delamination (Lustrino and Wilson, 2007). 

 However, it has also been suggested that the constant isotopic composition 

observed in such a large area was the result of a mantle contamination episode during 

the Cretaceous by the same mantle plume responsible by the magmatism of the Central 

Atlantic Magmatic Province (Piromallo et al., 2008). For these authors, this deeply 

rooted plume is nowadays responsible for the volcanism in the Canaries and Cape 

Verde hotspots.  

More recently, Matton and Jebrák (2009) included both the onshore and offshore 

intrusions and volcanics of the WIM in the Peri Atlantic Alkaline Pulse (PAAP) along 

with other paired onshore and offshore igneous alkaline rocks along the Atlantic 

margin. They have envisaged a model where edge driven asthenospheric convection and 

the resulting mantle upwelling acted simultaneously with the reorganization of 

intraplate stresses and consequential reactivation of deep seated zones of weakness to 

promote magma generation through decompression melting and the ascension of the 

resulting alkaline magmas to the surface. 

In the following part of this section detailed information about the age, 

geochemistry and emplacement mechanism for each of the studied onshore and offshore 

Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic occurrences will be provided.

2.3.1.1 The Sintra igneous complex 

The Sintra igneous complex outcrops approximately 25 km west of Lisbon, 

having an emerged area of approximately 40 km2. It was also mapped underwater, 

towards the west, where it is thought to occupy a similar area to the one observed on 

land.  With a maximum height of over 500 m, it constitutes one of the most prominent 

geomorphological features in the region. 

The complex intrudes Upper Jurassic carbonates and Early Cretaceous 

sandstones, forming a ring of contact metamorphism that produced mostly calc-silicate 

hornfels and recrystallized sandstones. These lithologies also make up some stoped 

blocks observed in the interior of the complex.  

The complex can be considered as being constituted by three main units, as 

follows: i) the Sintra granite that occupies most of the outcropping area and envelops a 

second unit, ii) the Cabo da Roca complex, a unit located in the western part of the 

complex and formed by amphibole rich gabros (mafraites), quartz diorites, quartz 

syenites and igneous breccias (fig. 2.9); note that there is also a small array of altered 

gabbroic bodies that outcrop in the northern contact, parallel to the Sintra northern 

thrust (fig. 2.9), and iii) the surrounding complex of dykes. 

Wright (1968) recognised four distinct syenite units and two overlapping ring 

complexes inside the Cabo da Roca complex, which have different ages, geochemistry 

and degrees of contamination, while Sparks and Wadge (1975) identified five syenite 

units and also a stratified sequence of eruptive rocks (from trachybasalts to rhyolites). 

They also classified the some of the breccias as lavas and pyroclastic breccias of the 

basalt-trachyte suite and recognised net veined complexes formed by magma mixing. 

Both Wright (1968) and Sparks and Wadge (1975) argued that the granite pre-dates the 

Cabo da Roca complex with only Matos Alves (1964) arguing that all the rocks present 

in Sintra are co-genetic.  

The intrusion of the complex was accompanied by the intrusion of a series of 

sills and dykes of different compositions that can be divided in radial dykes, cone sheets 

and sills (Matos Alves, 1964). The sills are mostly altered, basic to intermediate 

porphyritic rocks, which include the sampled Malveira da Serra sill and intrude mostly 

in the sedimentary country rock in the southern and eastern flanks of the complex, as are 

the mafic radial dykes that occur in the same area. The cone sheets are mainly felsic to 



 

34 
 

intermediate and are observed mainly in the southern flank of the complex dipping 

towards it (Matos Alves, 1964). 

 

 
Fig. 2.9: Geological map of the Sintra region. Adapted from Kullberg et al., 2006. 

 

 Geothermobarometric studies on rocks belonging to the intrusion suggest that 

the complex was emplaced at a pressure of 1.5 kb (depth around 5-6 km) and had 

crystallization temperatures between 1100-1000ºC for the gabbros and 700ºC for the 

granites (Palácios et al., 1995). 

 Gravimetric data collected in and around the complex points towards distinct 

geometries for the granite and central gabbro-diorite-syenite complexes. The granite has 

a laccolithic shape being 12 km long , 8 km wide and 1 km thick (Terrinha et al., 2003; 

Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). Based on the analysis of gravimetric and anisotropy of the 

magnetic susceptibility data, these authors propose that the granitic magma intruded 

through conduits with E-W, NE-SW and NNW-SSE directions which were afterwards 

reused during the intrusion of the gabbroic to syenitic magmas that show a subvertical 



 

35 
 

plug like shape reaching depths of 4 km (fig. 2.9B). The NNW-SSE structures were 

active during the Middle Jurassic as rift faults. These faults extend as a fault zone 

intruded by a complex of dykes that extends to the south of the Sintra complex until the 

Arrábida chain for more than 40km and were re-worked as a dextral strike-slip faults 

during the Cenozoic tectonic inversion. The E-W faults were also active during the 

Mesozoic rifting and served as thrusts during tectonic inversion, such as the main Sintra 

thrust located in the northern part of the complex (fig. 2.10a,b and c). The NW-SE faults 

served as sinistral strike-slip faults during inversion (fig. 2.2a, 10).  

The petrogenesis of this complex has been intensely debated along the years and 

up to the present (e.g. Matos Alves, 1964; Wright, 1968; Sparks and Wadge, 1975; 

Leal, 1990, 1991; Palácios et al., 1995, 1999). Matos Alves (1964) proposed the 

generation of all the observed lithologies through processes of fractional crystallization 

and assimilation of a granitic contaminant by a parental basic undersaturated magma 

with a mafraite like composition. Wright (1968) favoured a model where the granite and 

the gabbro-syenite suite were not comagmatic, with the granite resulting from crustal 

anatexis and being emplaced before the gabbros and syenites, which in their turn 

resulted from the differentiation and contamination of a basic mafraitic magma by a 

more evolved felsic liquid, leading to enrichment in alumina, alkalis and volatiles. 

Sparks and Wadge (1975) supported that high pressure garnet and clinopyroxene 

fractionation from an hypersthene normative picritic basalt, or partial melting of a 

phlogopite rich source at pressures above 15 kb are the mechanisms that might have 

generated the undersatured basic magmas seen in Sintra and in the Lisbon Volcanic 

complex, while the syenites and trachytes of the same region should have evolved 

directly from the hypersthene normative basalts that did not go through high pressure 

fractional crystallization. 

More recently, Leal (1990, 1991) analysed petrographic and geochemical data 

and concluded that the granite was generated by melting of a felsic rock, probably from 

the Variscan basement, while the other rocks in the complex evolved from the gabbroic 

to the syenitic term by fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, amphibole, 

plagioclase and biotite coupled with assimilation of crustal lithologies. The Rare Earth 

Element (REE) and incompatible trace element geochemistry also confirms the genetic 

link between gabbros and syenites and implies a more important role for crustal 

assimilation in the generation of the granites (Palácios et al., 1999) when compared to 

the syenites.

2006.   

 

Concerning geochronology, the granite has systematically yielded older ages 

than the suite of gabbro-diorite-syenite and associated breccias present in the complex. 

According to the published data, the emplacement of the granite (85 ± 8 Ma, Rb-Sr, 

Bonhome et al., 1961; 81.9 ± 0.4 Ma, K-Ar in biotite, MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; 84.0 

± 1.1, K-Ar in K-feldspar, Storetvedt et al., 1987) occurred before the intrusion of the 



 

37 
 

gabbro and syenite magmas (76.1 ± 1.1 to  78.3 ± 1.9 Ma, K-Ar in whole rock syenite, 

Storetvedt et al., 1987; 74.9 ± 1.0 Ma whole-rock K-Ar in gabbro, Storetvedt et al., 

1987). This is compatible with field relations and the geophysical studies that revealed 
the complex’s structure in depth and show that the gabbroic and syenitic rocks intrude 

the granite (Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). 

The available Sr isotopic data for the Sintra complex point towards a common 

origin for the gabbroic and syenitic magmas (87Sr/86Sr74 = 0.7039 to 0.7042, Mendes, 

1968; Abranches and Canilho, 1981) that could correspond to a basic magma with 

unradiogenic Sr which was slightly contaminated by a more radiogenic crustal lithology 

to produce the syenites. The more radiogenic composition of the granites (87Sr/86Sr80 = 

0.7052 to 0.70601 Mendes, 1968; Abranches and Canilho, 1981) favours its generation 

by higher amount of crustal contamination of a relatively unradiogenic, probably mantle 

derived, magma and not by pure crustal anatexis, due to the observed isotopic values 

being quite lower than what would be expected for felsic continental crust. 

Contemporaneously with the tectonic inversion of the Lusitanian basin, the 

Sintra region suffered substantial deformation, resulting in the development of an E-W 

thrust, probably reactivating an older extensional fault, in front of the northern limit of 

the complex which also led to the exhumation of the complex during the Paleogene 

(Kullberg et al., 2006). The field evidence is supported by fission-track data on apatites 

that point towards exhumation in Eocene times (Stapel et al., 1996). 

 

 

2.3.1.2 The Sines igneous complex 

 The Sines igneous alkaline complex delineates a well defined promontory in the 

western Portuguese coast, at approximately 38ºN (fig. 2.8). It has an onshore 

outcropping area of about 6 km2, but most of the complex is covered by Pliocene and 

Quaternary littoral deposits and dunes. Its outcrop area in the continental shelf is 

approximately the same size of the Sintra submarine part, i.e. roughly 40 km2 

(Monteiro, 1984), increasing the size of the complex while also changing its shape to an 

ellipse with an WNW-ESE major axis approximately 12 km long and with a minor axis 

with 3.5 km (Inverno et al., 1993).  

The Sines complex is overlain by Upper Jurassic limestones of the Santiago do 

Cacém Mesozoic basin (part of the Alentejo basin) along its northern boundary, whilst 



 

38 
 

along the southern one it is bordered by Carboniferous turbiditic meta-sediments of the 

Mira Formation (Namurian; Oliveira, 1990). The intrusion produced a contact aureole 

that includes calcic and pelitic hornfels. It is associated with the formation of a dense 

dyke complex that shows a very wide range of lithologies, from basic to intermediate 

and acid (lamprophyres, pyroxenites, basalts, microdiorites, trachybasalts, trachytes, 

microsyenites, microgranites) and occur in all directions although N-S and E-W 

dominate  (Canilho, 1972).  

  

 

Fig. 2.11: Geological map of the Sines complex. S – syenites; G – gabbros and diorites. 

 

Inside the complex, the main outcropping rocks are quartz syenites, diorites and 

gabbros both of the amphibole rich variety observed in Sintra (South, at Vasco da Gama 

beach) or of an another olivine rich and amphibole poorer variety that appears to show 

some banding (North, in Pedras de Sal). All these rocks are cut by the previously 

mentioned dyke complex. 



 

39 
 

 The Sines complex was also subject to several dating attempts using the K-Ar 

and Rb-Sr methods. The wide range of displayed "ages" (78.9 ± 1.5 to 62.0 ± 1.3 Ma K-

Ar in whole rock diabase dykes; 75.2 ± 0.8 to 63.8 ± 0.8 Ma K-Ar age in K-feldspar 

from the syenite; 72.0 ± 1.5 Rb-Sr whole rock isochron, Canilho and Abranches, 1982), 

particularly the values below 70 Ma are probably the result of a late thermal overprint 

that may have caused argon loss (Storetvedt et al., 1987) and its central age should be 

somewhere between 72 and 75 Ma. 

The incompatible element enriched nature of the more basic magmas, jointly 

with the observed negative K anomalies in primitive mantle normalized incompatible 

element diagrams and light REE enrichment ((La/Yb)n = 17.25 – 3.29) and low initial 
87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70331, Canilho e Abranches, 1982)  suggest that the basic magmas 

were the result of small volume partial melting in the presence of  residual garnet and a 

K-rich phase (possibly phlogopite or amphibole) of a mantle source enriched in 

incompatible elements but with a time integrated Sr depletion, with a possible affinity 

with the HIMU mantle component (Martins and Olivença, 1998). 

 As for the generation of the remaining observed lithologies, it has been proposed 

that a common basic source represented by the gabbros then generated the diorites and 

syenites by fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, amphibole and 

plagioclase in a closed system (Canilho, 1972; Martins and Olivença, 1998). 

 

 

2.3.1.3 The Monchique igneous complex 

 The Monchique igneous alkaline complex is located in the Western Algarve, has 

an approximately elliptical shape and occupies an area of about 80 km2. It is formed by 

two concentric nepheline syenite bodies, with associated lamprophyre dykes and 

breccias enclosing small mafic to ultramafic rock outcrops (Rock, 1978; Gonzalez-

Clavijo and Valadares, 2003; Valadares, 2004). It intrudes the Paleozoic South 

Portuguese Zone, namely Carboniferous shales and quartzitic sandstones of the Brejeira 

Formation (Middle Namurian–Early Westphallian; Oliveira, 1990) that underwent 

earlier Variscan metamorphism. The intrusion produced a 200 m thick contact 

metamorphism aureole. This is the most voluminous of the southern alkaline intrusions 

and has the particular characteristics of being the only one emplaced exclusively in 



 

40 
 

rocks of Paleozoic age that remained unaffected by Mesozoic rifting, and to show a 

silica undersaturated character for its entire lithological spectrum. 

 

 
Fig. 2.12: Geological map of the Monchique igneous complex. From Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, 

2003. 

 

Recent revision of the geological mapping of this complex allowed the 

identification of two concentric units of different nepheline syenites, the inner of which 

encloses various bodies of basic and ultra-basic rocks (fig. 2.12; Gonzalez-Clavijo and 

Valadares, 2003). These authors also proposed an intrusion mechanism where basic 

magmas initially ascended through pre-existing ENE-WSW faults that were reactivated 

during a Cretaceous extensional regime. They were followed by the emplacement of 

several heterogenous nepheline syenite bodies that ascended through the same conduits, 

and were afterwards followed by a last pulse characterized by the ascension of the 

homogenous nepheline syenite body that intrudes all of the previous ones (fig. 2.13; 

Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, 2003). 



 

41 
 

 

Fig. 2.13: Diagram illustrating the installation mechanism proposed by Clavijo and Valadares (2003) for 

the Monchique igneous complex.  
  

The Monchique complex has been dated with both the K-Ar and the Rb-Sr 

method (table 1), with the obtained ages clustering around 72 Ma (72.0 ± 2.0 mean K-

Ar ages on mineral separates, MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; 72.0 Ma Rb-Sr whole rock 

isochron, Rock, 1976, Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 2004), although the K-

Ar ages obtained for K-feldspar and nepheline separates show some spread, attributed to 

Ar loss (MacIntyre and Berger, 1982). 

The geochemical evolution of the complex appears to have happened through 

fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, magnetite, kaersutite, titanite and apatite 

from an initial basic magma represented by the mafic and ultramafic rocks in the 

complex (Valadares, 2004). That primary magma must have derived from the low 

volume partial melting of a mantle source enriched in incompatible elements and in the 

presence of residual garnet ((La/Yb)n = 20.9 to 29.1) and a K-rich phase (probably 

amphibole or phlogopite) similar to the one proposed for the Sines igneous complex. 

The isotopic signatures for these rocks show unradiogenic initial Sr (87Sr/86Sr72 ? 0.703, 

Bernard Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 2004), high ?Nd (?Nd72 4.3 - 5.6, Bernard 

Griffiths et al., 1997) values and a Pb isotopic signature (206Pb/204Pb72 - 19.13 to 19.42; 



 

42 
 

207Pb/204Pb72 - 15.61 to 15.64; 208Pb/204Pb72 - 38.8 to 39.2; Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997) 

that plots on the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line (NHRL; Hart, 1984).  

These isotopic characteristics, together with the silica undersaturation, and the 

absence of negative Nb and Ta anomalies in the Monchique rocks, exclude the 

hypothesis of crustal contamination playing a major role on the generation and 

evolution of this rock suite and allow the deduction that these resulted from the partial 

melting of an asthenospheric mantle reservoir of the PREMA (the Prevalent Mantle of 

Zindler and Hart, 1986) type (Bernard Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 2004), although 

some interaction with the overlying lithospheric mantle is thought to have had a minor 

role in enriching the Monchique magmas in light REE, consequentially lowering its ?Nd 

when compared with the nearby alkaline and possibly cogenetic magmatism in the 

Ormonde seamount (Bernard Griffiths et al., 1997) 

It has been proposed that the Monchique complex is part of a possible Madeira 

hotspot track before it was ~200 km displaced to the West through right lateral offset 

along the Azores–Gibraltar Fracture zone (Geldmacher and Hoernle, 2000). 

 

 

2.3.1.4 The Lisbon Volcanic Complex 

The Lisbon Volcanic Complex (LVC) is an intrusive and extrusive event 

constituted by a series of volcanic necks, lava flows, breccias, plugs, dykes and sills, 

occupying a total area of approximately 200 km2 (fig. 2.14). Their composition is 

mostly basaltic (s.l.), although intermediate and acid terms are also present 

(trachybasalts, trachytes and rhyolites) but correspond to a much smaller volume 

(Palácios, 1985). It is the most recent known alkaline occurrence in the Lusitanian Basin 

(72 ± 3 Ma; K-Ar isochron by Ferreira and Macedo, 1979) and outcrops in the block 

limited by the Nazaré and Arrábida faults, more specifically in the Lisbon region. The 

volcanic activity is contemporaneous with the previously mentioned uplift of the 

Nazaré-Arrábida block of the Lusitanian basin and sits on top of a paleokarst formed by 

the erosional unconformity carved on Cenomanian limestones. The subaerial volcanism 

is divided in at least six effusive and explosive events that originated a sequence of 

flows and pyroclastic ash deposits at least 400 m thick (Serralheiro, 1978; Ramalho et 

al., 2001).

The enrichment in incompatible elements  and low 87Sr/86Sr72 (approximately 

0.70325, Palácios, 1985) of the basic magmas suggest they were generated by a low 

volume partial melting of an incompatible element enriched mantle source, 

characterized by a time integrated Sr depletion and the presence of residual garnet and 



 

44 
 

K-rich mineral, similarly what was described for the intrusive igneous complexes. The 

isotopic Sr (87Sr/86Sr72 = 0.70325-0.70812) and O (?18O = 6.22-11.19) signatures of the 

entire suite point towards the evolution from the more basic to the more acid members 

taking place by the joint action of low pressure fractional crystallization of a basic 

alkaline magma along with the assimilation of crustal materials (Palácios, 1985). 

 

 

2.3.1.5 The Mafra radial dyke complex, Oeiras-Cascais dykes, Paço d'Ilhas and Foz da 

Fonte sills and other minor occurrences in the Lusitanian basin 

Several other smal alkaline intrusions of Late Cretaceous age can be found in the 

Lusitanian basin. They are not integrated in the LVC because some of them appear to be 

associated with a different stress field (Mafra radial dyke swarm, Oeiras-Cascais dykes), 

have older ages (Paço d'Ilhas sill) or are located relatively far from the LVC (the Foz da 

Fonte sill and the intrusions associated with the Sesimbra salt diapir). 

Among them, one of the most discussed is the Mafra radial dyke complex (fig. 

2.14). It is constituted by a series of dykes that radiate from a central gabbroic plug 

located in the vicinities of Mafra. These dykes are substantially altered alkaline basic 

rocks and are best observed in the coastal area around Ericeira. Their outcropping 

pattern suggests intrusion with a stress field characterized by radial ?1 (where: ?3 – 

maximum compression; ?2 intermediate compression; ?1 – minimum compression) 

controlled by a deep intrusion. They were recently subject of an integrated Anisotropy 

of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) and analysis of preferred mineral and vesicle 

orientation study that points towards the magmatic flow coming from the direction of 

the central plug and at an angle that suggests the presence of a larger magma chamber at 

a depth of approximately 3.2 km (Nogueira et al., 2008). 

 

The Paço d'Ilhas sill (fig. 2.14), also known as the Ribamar gabbro (Zbyszewski 

et al., 1955), was previously included in the LVC due to its similar chemical and 

petrographic characteristics (Palácios, 1985), but subsequent age determinations showed 

that it is actually between 88 and 86 My old (K-Ar ages in biotite and K-feldspar 

separates, respectively, Mahmoudi, 1991) and therefore significantly older than the 

LVC. The sill intrudes Lower Cretaceous sediments (Albian and Aptian-Barremian 

sandstones and limestones), having an outcropping area of around 6 km2. It is a layered 



 

45 
 

intrusion made up of monzonitic and syenitic sheets in a monzograbbroic body 

(Mahmoudi, 1991). These correspond to segregations produced by fractional 

crystallization processes with the lighter plagioclases accumulating on top of the sill by 

flotation and the heavier mafic minerals sinking to the bottom (Mahmoudi, 1991). 

 

The 8 m thick Foz da Fonte sill (fig. 2.8) is located in the Setúbal Peninsula, on 

the cliffs just South of the beach with the same name and corresponds to the 

southernmost intrusion in the Lusitanian basin. It outcrops for around 150m along the 

coast, and it terminates against the Aptian sediments it intrudes in the north, while in its 

southern limit it is cut by an NNW-SSE trending dextral strike-slip fault (Kullberg, 

2000). It has recently been the target of an AMS study that proposed that the magmatic 

conduit for this sill has a NNE-SSW direction and could be possibly related to a 

reactivated Variscan fault or to a secondary fracture related with the NNW-SSE Sintra-

Sines-Monchique deep fault (Miranda et al., 2006). 

 

The Oeiras-Cascais dykes (fig. 2.14) outcrop in the coastal area between the 

Carcavelos beach and Cabo Raso. They display orientations between NNE-SSW and 

NNW-SSE and are constituted by alkaline basalts, lamprophyres and hawaiites 

(Miranda et al., 2005). They are thought to have intruded pre-existing fractures formed 

by a stress field characterized by N-S ?3, vertical ?2 and approximately E-W ?1, with 

?2 and ?3 inverting during the installation of the dykes (Costa, 1980). A more recent 

work on the westernmost dykes concluded that these were emplaced in  previously 

existing cleavage fractures contemporaneously with an important left strike slip 

movement along these same fractures within a stress field characterized by an E-W to 

NW-SE ?3 (Maia and Gonçalves, 2006).  

 
 

 

2.3.1.6 Minor occurrences in the Algarve basin 

The Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism is also represented in the Algarve 

basin by a series of dykes, plugs, sills and necks of basanitic to lamprophyric nature 

(Martins, 1991). They outcrop mostly in the coastal region and are also associated with 

salt diapirs. Their emplacement is contemporaneous with the above mentioned 

Monchique igneous complex (72 to 75 Ma, Martins, 1991; 61.5-70.4 Ma, Storetvedt et 



 

46 
 

al., 1990) with which they also share geochemical affinities, pointing to a similar 

sublithospheric mantle source (e.g.87Sr/86Sr75 = 0.70276-0.70385, enrichment in 

incompatible elements and light REE, Martins 1991). Their mineralogy, namely the 

existence of green core clinopyroxenes and amphiboles with partly resorpted cores, 

points towards an important contribution of magma mixing in the generation of the 

observed lithotypes, with the basanites representing a complete mix between a more 

evolved and a more basic magma and the lamprophyres corresponding to only partial 

mixing of these liquids due to smaller residence times in the magma chamber and faster 

extraction (Martins, 1999). 

 

2.3.2 The offshore West Iberian Margin 

 

 The significant advances made recently in the Marine Geosciences domain have 

allowed researchers to identify, sample and study a series of previously unknown 

igneous alkaline seamounts in the WIM. The purpose of this section is to describe these 

occurrences and, when possible, discuss the mechanisms responsible for their 

generation.  

 

 

2.3.2.1 The Madeira-Tore Rise 

 The Madeira-Tore rise groups a series of mid ocean ridge parallel seamounts 

between the Tore seamount and its several peaks, and the Madeira archipelago (fig. 

2.15). It encompasses the Josephine and Lion seamounts, among many others whose 

name changes depending on author and publication. It is cut in across by the Azores-

Gibraltar fracture zone, dividing it in a northern branch that includes all the seamounts 

between Tore and Josephine and a southern branch that groups the remaining seamounts 

from Josephine to Madeira. The rise has a total estimated volume of erupted magma of 

105 km3 (Merle et al., 2009) 

The rise is located on transitional to oceanic crust and extruded onto seafloor 

with an age corresponding to the J magnetic anomaly (? 124-118 Ma) and is paired with 

the J Anomaly ridge across the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR), on the American plate 

(Peirce and Barton, 1991). 



 

47 
 

 
Fig. 2.15: Map of the alkaline igneous occurrences in the West Iberian Margin. Ages from 

Geldmacher et al., 2006, and Merle et al., 2006, 2009. 

 

 Its origin was initially attributed to the Madeira hotspot, with the seamounts 

representing its hotspot trail (Morgan, 1982; Crough, 1983; Ferreira et al., 1988), but 

the existence of the conjugate J Anomaly ridge led Peirce and Barton (1991) to propose 

that they had been generated during a period of intense volcanism in the MAR which 



 

48 
 

produced a thicker, isostatically balanced oceanic crust. However, the most recent 

studies revealed that some of the seamounts that constitute the Madeira-Tore rise have 

ages more recent than the magnetic J anomaly, which argues for a different generation 

mechanism (Merle et al., 2006, 2009; Geldmacher et al., 2006). 

  Merle et al. (2006) analyzed several intermediate igneous alkaline rocks from 

the northern branch of the rise, which they also dated using the U-Pb method in zircon 

and titanite separates. The ages obtained show a range from 80 to 104 Ma and show no 

spatial age progression. The isotopic signatures shown by these rocks (206Pb/204Pb 

19.139 - 19.620, 207Pb/204Pb 15.544 - 15.828, 208Pb/204Pb 38.750 - 39.936, 87Sr/86Sri 

0.70231 - 0.70340, and ?Hfi 6.9 a 12) are distinct from the ones shown by normal Mid 

Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORBs) and the rocks associated with the Madeira and Azores 

hotspots. They were interpreted by the authors as being derived from the interaction 

between a long lived thermal anomaly with an OIB-like (Ocean Island Basalt) 

composition associated with some  crustal recycling, probably through delamination or 

interaction with the Iberian lithospheric mantle and crust (Merle et al., 2006). 

 The southern branch of the Madeira-Tore rise was dated through the Ar-Ar and 

biostratigraphic methods and yielded ages that can be divided into two groups 

(Geldmacher et al., 2006). The first phase of magmatism took place during the Late 

Cretaceous, between 80 and 95 Ma, and is detected in the base of the larger seamounts 

and around to the Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone, while the second phase is of Neogene 

age (16 – 0.5 Ma) and was identified on the top of some seamounts, especially the ones 

closer to the Azores-Gibraltar fracture in the elevations just north to the Madeira 

Archipelago (Geldmacher et al., 2006). The Late Cretaceous rocks are trace element 

enriched and their isotopic composition is compatible (206Pb/204Pbi 19.44 – 19.55, 
207Pb/204Pbi 15.58–15.59, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.73 – 39.15, 87Sr/86Sri 0.702797 – 0.702883, 
143Nd/144Ndi   0.512878 – 0.512885 176Hf/177Hfi  0.282976)  with a derivation from the 

Canary mantle plume, while the Neogene show a wider range of isotopic compositions 

(206Pb/204Pbi 18.792– 20.245, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.485–15.619, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.334– 39.968, 
87Sr/86Sr 0.702800 – 0.703238, 143Nd/144Ndi   0.512842– 0.513090 176Hf/177Hfi  

0.283004 - 0.283163) that overlap both the Madeira and Canary domains with the 

northern occurrences being more isotopically enriched than the southern ones 

(Geldmacher et al., 2006). The authors explain these differences in composition and age 

with a model considering that the first phase generated by the interaction of the Canary 



 

49 
 

hotspot with the MAR whereas the second pulse is a mix of activity derived from the 

Madeira hotspot in the southernmost part of the ridge and from the melting of 

lithospheric mantle on extensional basins in the vicinities of the Azores-Gibraltar 

fracture zone. That lithospheric mantle either contained pyroxentic material or had been 

previously metasomatized and overprinted by the Canary plume in the Cretaceous 

(Geldmacher et al., 2006). 

 

 
Fig. 2.16: Evolution of the Madeira-Tore rise according to Geldmacher et al., 2006.  

 

 Further geochronological work by Merle et al. (2009) led these authors to 

recognize a total of three pulses between 103 Ma and the present. The first and oldest 

taking place between 103 and 80.5 Ma in the northern and central part of the Rise, the 

second c. 68 Ma and finally a third one between 28 Ma and the present day.  

 However, if one considers the onshore magmatic activity and includes the 

Ormonde, Ampére and Coral patch seamounts, six distinct stages are identified during 

these pulses, with some of them defining linear trends (Merle et al., 2009).  

According to Merle et al. (2009) the first stage occurred during the first pulse and 

defined the lineament between the Sponge Bob and Jo Sister seamounts between 108 

and 88 Ma (fig. 2.17), while the Iberian plate was moving in a NE direction. The second 



 

50 
 

stage also occurred during the first pulse, but has a different distribution, occurring 

randomly in the rise but also in the continent between 88 and 81 Ma (fig. 2.17). From 

83 Ma onward the direction of movement of the Iberian plate changes again with the 

ceasing of seafloor spreading in the Bay of Biscay which caused the rocks of stage 3 to 

be aligned in an NNW-SSE direction while they intruded between 80 and 69 Ma due to 

the new NNW movement direction of the plate (fig. 2.17).  

The fourth stage took place between 68 and 60 Ma and is again randomly distributed in 

the oceanic domain. It was followed by stage 5, a period during which no magmatism 

took place in the region and finally by stage 6, ongoing from 32 Ma to the present with 

activity occurring from the Azores Gibraltar fault zone area down to the Madeira 

archipelago (fig. 2.17).  

 

 
Fig. 2.17: Distribution of the pulses of alkaline igneous activity in the Central North Atlantic according to 

Merle et al., 2009.  

 

Merle et al. (2009) attribute the stages where the magmatic activity seems to 

have a random distribution (stages 2 and 4) to times of little or no movement in the 

Iberian plate that led to heat accumulation in the mantle due to the blanketing effect of 

the lithosphere and inducing magmatism in random locations. They also justified the 

lack of magmatism during stage 5 with the collision of Iberia and Europe and 

consequent formation of the Pyrenees creating a compressive stress field in both the 



 

51 
 

oceanic and continental lithosphere of the Iberian plate that prevented magma ascent. At 

last, during stage 6 the continuing compression still prevented the emission of magma at 

the surface, but the continuous thermal blanketing effect of the lithosphere led to 

magma generation, with its release being only possible on the African plate or in the 

border between Africa and Iberia, where lithospheric structures might have facilitated 

magma ascent. 

 

 

2.3.2.2 The Sintra-Tore lineament 

 This lineament is defined by a series of magnetic anomalies (e.g. Silva et al., 

2000, fig. 2.18) and small seamounts present between the Sintra igneous complex and 

the Tore seamount.  

 

 
Fig. 2.18: Magnetic anomalies of the West Iberian Margin and the lineaments defined by them. Adapted 
from Silva et al., 2000. 
 



 

52 
 

The nature of the rocks that constitute it is still mostly unknown, except for one 

ankaramite dredged by Mougenot (1989) near one of the magnetic anomalies and dated 

at 74 Ma (Ar-Ar; Feraud in Mougenot, 1989). Only one of these seamounts has been 

sampled and will be discussed later in this study.  

Moreover, Alves et al. (2006) identify an intrusive body in the continental 

platform West of Sintra based on seismic reflection data. 

This lineament roughly coincides with the boundary between the Paleozoic Ossa 

Morena Zone and South Portuguese Zone terranes and is the equivalent to Collector 

anomaly in the North American plate, which might correspond to the Theic ocean suture 

(Lefort et al., 1996; Capdevila and Mougenot, in Boilot and Winterer (eds.), 1988). 

Badagola (2008) showed that the morphological expression of this lineament on the 

Estremadura Spur corresponds to the seafloor trace of a NW-SE to WNW-ESE strike-

slip fault. 

 Roque et al. (2009) identified a series of WNW-ESE to E-W structures in the 

Estremadura Spur and between that feature and the Tore seamount that correspond to 

thrusts and backthrusts that deform sediments up to the Pliocene-Pleistocene.  

 

 

2.3.2.3 The Ormonde seamount, Gorringe bank 

 The Gorringe bank is a major morphological feature that rises from the seafloor 

of the Tagus Abyssal Plain at rougly -5000m to -24m at the top of Gettysburgh 

seamount. The Ormonde seamount corresponds to the northeastern peak of the Gorringe 

bank, where one can find alkaline basalts, nephelinites, nepheline syenites, phonolites 

and monchiquites outcropping in the seabottom (Cornen, 1982). These rocks intrude or 

cover Cretaceous peridotites, and tholeiitic gabbros and basalts that are thought to 

represent a section of oceanic lithosphere thrusted onto the Tagus Abyssal Plain along 

the Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone in mid Miocene times (Auzende et al., 1978; Féraud 

et al., 1986, fig. 2.19). The ages obtained for these rocks vary between 67-65 Ma (Ar-

Ar, in whole rock, phlogopite and secondary hornblende Féraud et al., 1982, 1986) and 

77 Ma (U-Pb in zircon separate, Schärer et al., 2000). This age variation with method 

suggests that the more recent ages obtained with the Ar-Ar method might represent later 

deformation phases that reset the Ar system or indicate very slow cooling (Schärer et 

al., 2000), although Merle et al. (2009) suggested that the sample dated by Schärer et al. 

(2000) might be a dropstone that originally came from the Sines igneous complex.  



 

53 
 

 

Fig. 2.19: Diagram showing the Gorringe bank, its structure and the position of tholeiitic lithosphere and 
posterior alkaline magmatism. From Scharër et al., 2000. 

 

 Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997) studied the geochemical and isotopic composition 

of the alkaline rocks of the Ormonde seamount and concluded that these bear many 

similarities with the ones found in the Monchique igneous complex (87Sr/86Sri 0.70304 – 

0.70482, ?Ndi   6.0-6.9, 206Pb/204Pbi 19.07– 19.81, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.57–15.77, 208Pb/204Pbi 

38.8– 39.5 for whole rock and 87Sr/86Sri 0.70303 – 0.70306, ?Ndi   0.3-6.7 for 

clinopyroxene separates) although the ?Ndi values for Ormonde are either higher 

(whole rock) or much lower (clinopyroxene separates) than the ones seen in Monchique. 

The lower ?Ndi values were interpreted by these authors as reflecting the presence of a 

mantle lithosphere component in the Ormonde rocks similar to the one observed in 

Monchique, while the higher ones are associated with the dominating asthenospheric 

component. 

 Along with the Monchique complex, this seamount has been included in the 

hotspot track for the Madeira plume (fig. 2.16, Geldmacher and Hoernle, 2000; 

Geldmacher et al., 2000; Geldmacher et al., 2005).

3. Continental intraplate alkaline anorogenic magmatism 
and its geodynamic implications 
 
 Although it is not the most important type of magmatism in terms of total 

erupted volume, alkaline anorogenic magmatism can act as a marker for important 

geodynamic processes, such as rifting, the presence of mantle plumes and their 

interaction with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, and the influence of major 

structure on controlling the emplacement and location of these magmatic features, while 

also providing a good proxy record for the chemical and physical evolution of the deep 

continental lithosphere and underlying mantle.  

Basic magmas can be generated by adiabatic decompression, volatile addition 

that results in the lowering of the protolite’s solidus, and by the supply of extra heat by 

a thermal perturbation of the geotherm (e.g. Wilson, 1989). In an intraplate setting, 

decompression is usually associated with extension and rifting, fluid addition to a 

metasomatic event that may or may not be related to a mantle plume, which can also 

add the heat necessary to for partial melting to take place. 

The mantle plume definition used from here onwards is identical to the one of 

Morgan (1971, 1983) that defines a plume as a location where anomalously hot material 

that rises from a major mantle discontinuity (e.g. the D’’ discontinuity that separates the 

mantle from the outer core or the 670 km discontinuity that separates upper from lower 

mantle) and ascends until it meets the lithosphere where it will start promoting the 

generation of large amounts of melts due to the addition of heat and decompression 

melting. 

Potential sources for these basic liquids are usually ultramafic rocks (peridotites) 

in the upper mantle, which are mostly found in the rigid, conductive Continental 

Lithospheric Mantle (CLM) or in the underlying asthenosphere, a plastic, convective 

portion of the upper mantle. The CLM, however, is divided in two distinct layers: the 

Mechanical Boundary Layer (MBL) where heat transfers by conduction and 

deformation occurs in a fragile regime and the Thermal Boundary Layer (TBL) where 

heat is transferred both by convection and advection and that may suffer periodical 

recycling into the asthenosphere (e.g. Wilson, 1993, fig. 2.20). 

Besides the initial composition of both the lithosphere and asthenosphere, 

several other factors control the composition of the generated liquids, such as the extent 



 

55 
 

of partial melting, the potential temperature of the mantle (the temperature of a mantle 

rock if brought to the surface adiabatically), the thickness of the lithosphere, the amount 

of tectonic extension, the initial thickness of the Thermal Boundary Layer (TBL), the 

nature and efficiency of the magmatic extraction processes and the degree of interaction 

between the melts, the mantle lithosphere and the crust (Wilson, 1993). 

The liquids generated in these conditions in intraplate environments are divided 

into two major series, the alkalic and the tholeiitic. Alkaline intraplate continental 

basalts usually have lower silica and higher alkali (sodium and potassium) contents than 

tholeiitic basalts, which also show a characteristic pattern of initial iron enrichment 

during differentiation. Alkaline magmas are thought to result either from smaller partial 

melt fractions of the same source that also generates the tholeiitic liquids (e.g. Hirose 

and Kushiro, 1993) or from melting of mantle that contains metasomatically introduced, 

potassium rich, hydrous minerals such as phlogopite and amphibole (e.g. Foley, 1992).

Boundary Layer in the mantle and their relation with the advective and convective heat transfer regimes

In the following sections the mechanisms for the generation and installation for 

the alkaline magmatism will be presented and discussed.

3.1 Possible sources for alkaline anorogenic magmatism 

 

 
Fig. 2.21: Mathematical model of Brandenburg and van Keken (2007) illustrating mantle dymanics. 

Upon subduction (B), the lithosphere is recycled to the lower mantle (C) and returned to the mantle (D), 

and can be brought up at mid-oceanic ridges or through plumes (E) at ocean island hotspots.  

 

Basic magmas can be generated in either the lithospheric or the sublithospheric 

mantle (asthenosphere). This section aims to discuss these two as possible sources for 

anorogenic continental alkaline magmatism. 

 

3.1.1 The Continental Lithospheric Mantle  

 

 The Continental Lithospheric Mantle has long been proposed as a possible 

source for the magmas generated during rifting or the eruption of Large Igneous 

Provinces (LIPs). It represents a geochemical reservoir that can remain isolated from the 

convective mantle during long periods of time, allowing it to develop considerable 

chemical and isotopic heterogeneities, and whose later melting would lead to the 

formation of magmas with enriched trace element and isotopic compositions 

(McDonough, 1990). 

 According to Hawkesworth et al., (1990) the CLM’s ability to generate basaltic 

melts depends on its age, which also controls its thickness, composition and density. For 

instance, an Archaic CLM would be too thick and depleted in FeO due to the extraction 

of komatiites and therefore have low density and fertility. On the other hand, post 

Archaic CLM should be produced by the incorporation of asthenospheric material by 



 

57 
 

conductive cooling after rifting or intraplate magmatism. In comparison, this 

asthenosphere has not been so strongly depleted, since komatiite formation is mostly 

limited to the Archean, and is consequently richer in FeO, and as a result more dense 

and fertile and has also been enriched by the later percolation and crystallization of 

magmatic liquids rich in incompatible elements (McDonough, 1990).  

The liquids responsible for these alterations can be hydrous, carbonated or even 

siliceous melts enriched in incompatible elements that result from very small partial 

melt fractions of the asthenosphere (e.g. Yaxley et al., 1998; Niu and O’Hara, 2003; 

Pilet et al., 2008; Humphreys and Niu, 2009) and/or mantle plumes, generated by 

adiabatic decompression or simply by the heat addition of the plume. 

 The circulation of these silicate or carbonated melts and hydrous fluids produces 

mantle metasomatism, which divides itself in two main types, modal metasomatism, i.e. 

modifications to the original mineralogy of the mantle rocks, often introducing hydrated 

phases, and cryptic metasomatism which only affects the chemical composition and 

isotopic signatures of the same rocks (e.g. Bodinier and Godard, 2003 and references 

within). 

Pilet et al. (2008) put forward a model where metasomatic events would create 

metasomatic amphibole rich veins, with nephelinite-like compositions. When these 

nephelinitic veins melt, the resulting liquids interact with the host peridotite and 

generate the compositional spectrum of silica undersaturated alkaline rocks from the 

initial nephelinite through basanite and up to alkali basalt, depending on the degree of 

interaction (low or non existent for nephelinites and higher for alkali basalts). These 

authors did not provide contrains on the nature of the metasomatic agent. However, Niu 

(2008) suggested that these might be low degree partial melts from the low velocity 

zone in the asthenosphere.  

Volatile addition through metasomatic processes can, at a given pressure (or 

depth) significantly lower the solidus of the rocks it affects (e.g. Falloon and Green, 

1990 in Wilson, 1993). This favors the formation of magmas in regions where the 

mantle potential temperature is elevated by the proximity of a mantle plume and even in 

regions with low extension rates (Wilson, 1993) 

These metasomatic events can occur in different time scales, creating 

heterogeneous enrichments in the mantle and producing reservoirs with diversified 



 

58 
 

isotopic and chemical signatures. For example, metasomatic events have been detected 

between two different eruptive phases in the Cantal massif in France (Pilet et al., 2002), 

while the episode that enriched the CLM whose fusion generated the Cretaceous 

lamprophyres in Moravia is attributed to an event occurred during the Variscan orogeny 

in the late Paleozoic (Dostal and Owens, 1998). 

Such episodes would render the CLM a possible source for the basalts associated 

with LIPs and other continental basaltic magmatism with low ?Nd, variable 87Sr/86Sr 

and low 206Pb/204Pb, with the combination of slightly high 87Sr/86Sr with low 206Pb/204Pb 

acting as tracers for a continental lithospheric component (Hawkesworth et al., 1990). 

McDonough (1990), however, implies that this fertilization could not generate the large 

volume of magmas seen on LIPs, neither the Nb and Eu anomalies that characterize 

them and are not detected on mantle lithosphere xenoliths. Nevertheless, this author 

does not exclude that the CLM might be an important contributor in the generation of 

incompatible element enriched alkaline basalts. 

 A “pure” CML component would be sampled by undersaturated basic to 

ultrabasic magmas such as lamprophyres or lamproites and would have low ?Nd, 

moderate 87Sr/86Sr, mantle ?O18, low 206Pb/204Pb and both high 207Pb/204Pb and 
208Pb/204Pb as weel as characteristically unradiogenic 187Os/188Os (Pearson et al., 2004). 

This isotopic signature would reflect the CLM’s different evolution due to isolation 

from the convecting mantle, which allowed for a time integrated increase of Rb/Sr, 

Nd/Sm, Pb/Th and decrease of U/Pb (Saunders et al., 1992; Daley and DePaolo, 1992). 

 However, the signature of the lithospheric component can change with the age of 

the lithosphere and nature of the metasomatic event(s) it is affected by. Gibson et al., 

(1995) distinguished two mafic alkaline potassic suits with different major and trace 

element abundances and isotopic compositions in the Paraná Basin, Brazil. They 

interpreted the TiO2 rich, high CaO/Al2O3, 143Nd/144Nd and low La/Nb and 87Sr/86Sr 

magmas as originating in older, Archaic enriched cratonic CLM, while the TiO2 poor, 

low CaO/Al2O3 and 143Nd/144Nd, and high La/Nb and 87Sr/86Sr should have been 

generated by partial melting of CLM under Proterozoic mobile belts that are more 

refractory and less enriched. 

 During lithospheric thinning resulting from continental rifting it is expectable to 

come across products derived from the partial melting of metasomatized CLM but also 

from the ascending asthenosphere (e.g. Hawkesworth and Gallagher, 1993; Wilson, 



 

59 
 

1993). Hawkesworth and Gallagher (1993) state that the metasomatized CLM has a 

lower solidus and is the first to initiate melting in an extensional setting but with the 

continuation of rifting, the asthenosphere will also start melting and its contribution to 

the total melt generated should increase, quickly becoming dominant and masking or 

overwriting the geochemical imprint of the mantle lithosphere contribution, giving rise 

first to mixed trace element and isotopic signatures and afterwards to magmas that will 

show completely asthenospheric values (Wilson and Downes, 1992). 

 In addition to being a possible source for alkaline magma generation, the CLM 

can also control magma location and composition. 

 Watson and MacKenzie (1991) proposed that magma generation from anhydrous 

peridotites with potential temperatures above 1300ºC (as in a mantle plume) is 

impossible in lithospheres with an MBL thicker than 125 km. This would limit the 

localities where continental anorogenic magmatism could take place, as well as the 

volume of magma produced at a fixed temperature and uphold lithospheric thickness as 

a major control on the location of any kind of magmatism. 

 Also, for a given temperature and pressure (and depth), the generated melts will 

be richer in MgO in situations where the amount of partial melting is higher. For a fixed 

partial melt fraction, the MgO content increased with depth and pressure. According to 

that, alkaline mafic and ultramafic magmas are usually the product of small partial melt 

fractions at high depths, while tholeiitic magmas are produced by higher amounts of 

partial fusion of a shallower mantle source (Wilson, 1993). 

 Furthermore, Ellam (1992) suggested that the depth of the base of the 

lithosphere can be deduced from its chemical composition, since it will influence the 

REE abundances of the magmas given that it will control the mineralogy of the 

asthenospheric and lithospheric mantle rocks and consequentially the composition of 

the magmas generated in either of these layers. Stable phases in peridotite change with 

depth, with spinel occurring from 20-30 km to 60 km depth, from that depth onwards 

garnet is stable and completely replaces spinel below 80 km (Ellam, 1992).  

This results in different magma compositions of melts due to equilibration of the melts 

with different mantle parageneses and especially very different abundances in REE for 

magmas generated in the presence or absence of residual garnet since this mineral has 

very different partition coefficients (D), which are functions of the physical conditions 



 

60 
 

during melting and of the melt composition (D = mineral/melt partition coefficient = 

(concentration of element, i, in mineral)/ (concentration of i in coexisting melt)) for the 

light and heavy REE, with the first concentrating on the melt phase in case of partial 

melting and the one remaining on the residual garnets if the melt fraction is small 

enough not to completely consume them. Consequently, using a proxy for the light 

REE/ heavy REE ratio (such as Ce/Yb, Ce/Y or La/Yb) we can estimate the thickness of 

the lithosphere during magma generation and study its variation in prolonged eruption 

sequences (Ellam, 1992; Kerr, 1994). 

   

 
Fig. 2.22: Illustration of the differences in chemistry observed in areas where magma generation took 
place under  lithospheres with different thicknesses. Also depicted are the possible metasomatic veins that 
might be responsible for the generation of mafic alkali magmas, according to Pilet et al. (2008). Adapted 
from Humphreys and Niu, 2009. 

 
Consequentially, for a 125 km thick lithosphere it is estimated that extension with a 

stretching factor ? (? = l1/l0) lower than 1.5, would originate magmas by adiabatic 

decompression of the asthenosphere, representing a small partial melt fraction of deep 

garnet peridotites. These melts will be enriched in light REE in relation to heavy REE 

(high Ce/Yb), while magmas generated during and extensive phase with a higher 

stretching factor (? &gt; 2) would result from higher amounts of fusion of a shallower, 

garnet free peridotite (originally garnet free or where the small amounts of this mineral 



 

61 
 

are exhausted during melting) and necessarily have lower Ce/Yb values as spinel 

peridotites do not fraction REE (Ellam, 1992).  

This lithospheric lid effect has recently been found to also influence the major element 

composition of OIBs (Humphreys and Niu, 2009) with Si and Al decreasing, whereas 

Ti, Fe, Mg and P increase with increasing lithospheric thickness and consequentially 

increasing pressures and decreasing extents of melting (fig. 2.22). 

  

3.1.2 The Sub-Lithospheric Mantle  

 

 The Sub-Lithospheric Mantle is the source of the majority of the basic 

magmatism observed in the Earth’s crust. It encompasses two main reservoirs, the 

geochemically depleted asthenosphere and the enriched mantle plumes. 

The asthenosphere has been previously depleted by melt extraction (2-3% 

Workman and Hart, 2005) to form the oceanic crust, and its melts have unradiogenic 

isotopic compositions and are depleted in incompatible elements. Asthenospheric melts 

are widely represented in Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORBs). Present day melts 

generated by this reservoir and that have not significantly interacted with the lithosphere 

or mantle plume melts during their ascent should have isotopic and trace element 

signatures similar to the ones known for MORBs that are characterized by the 

component named Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70219 - 0.70307; 
143Nd/144Nd 0.51326 - 0.51300; 206Pb/204Pb 17.573 - 18.977; 207Pb/204Pb 15.404 - 

15.568; 176Hf/177Hf 0.28350 - 0.28310; Workman and Hart, 2005). 

  Oceanic Islands are largely constituted by basalts that have not 

interacted with continental crust and are supposed to represent uncontaminated mantle 

melts. Geochemical studies of these Ocean Island Basalts (OIBs) allowed the definition 

of several isotopically and geochemically distinct mantle end member components (e.g. 

Zindler and Hart, 1986; Weaver, 1991; Hofmann, 2003) which indicate derivation from 

mantle sources with diverse differentiation histories.

extreme isotopic compositions in isotope diagrams. They are the “type localities” for HIMU (Cook-
Austral Islands and St. Helena), EM-1 (Pitcairn-Gambier and Tristan), EM-2 (Society Islands, Samoa, 
Marquesas), and PREMA (Hawaiian Islands and Iceland). (b) 207Pb/204Pb versus 206Pb/204Pb for the same 
OIB as plotted in (a). Note that the 207Pb/204Pb ratios of St. Helena and Cook- Australs are similar but 
not identical, whereas they overlap completely in the other isotope diagrams. From Hoffman, 2003. 

 



 

63 
 

The geophysical (especially tomographical) work developed in these islands 

allowed their pairing with thermal anomalies in the mantle, corresponding to mantle 

plumes  that rise from deep within the mantle (e.g. Davies, 1990; Sleep, 1990), although 

this connection is still the subject of vigorous debate (e.g. King and Anderson, 1998, 

King and Ritsema, 2000, www.mantleplumes.org) . 

These end members can be viewed as isolated reservoirs in the mantle whose 

mixing among themselves and with DMM would produce the entire observed isotopic 

mantle array or as extremes in a continuum of isotopic compositions existing in mantle 

rocks (Hofmann, 2003). However one chooses to view them, these end members help to 

identify specific characters of mantle differentiation found on other OIBs with less 

extreme isotopic compositions. 

Isotopic compositions of rocks from these mantle end members show 

systematically more enriched in radiogenic strontium and less radiogenic in neodymium 

and hafnium isotopic ratios than DMM although considerable overlap can exist. In the 

case of lead, the overlap is complete but they extend to more extreme values in each of 

the isotopic ratios. The main characteristics, possible origins and the end member values 

for the Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions of each of the components defined by 

Zindler and Hart (1986) will be described below: 

 

 HIMU (HIgh µ): this component is characterized by high µ (µ = 238U/204Pbt=0) 

and highly radiogenic Pb isotope ratios, requiring a source with very high U/Pb and 

Th/Pb ratios, and relatively unradiogenic Sr, pointing towards a low Rb/Sr source 

similar to DMM. Chase (1981) and Hoffman and White (1982) suggested that this end 

member evolved from ancient subducted oceanic crust depleted Sr and enriched in U by 

hydrothermal alteration, which also depleted it in alkalis and Pb (Chauvel et al., 1992). 

Another, less popular explanation is that this end member is generated by enriching 

oceanic lithosphere during metasomatic episodes caused by the infiltration of low 

degree partial melts with high U/Pb and Th/Pb. 

HIMU: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70285; 143Nd/144Nd 0.51285; 206Pb/204Pb 21.80; 207Pb/204Pb 15.86; 

208Pb/204Pb 40.12; (Hart et al., 1992). 

 



 

64 
 

EM-1 (Enriched Mantle 1) and EM-2 (Enriched Mantle 2): the enriched mantle 

components are characterized by low 143Nd/144Nd, variable 87Sr/86Sr, high 207Pb/204Pb 

and 208Pb/204Pb (at a given value of 206Pb/204Pb) and, as such, derive from sources 

enriched in LILE (Rb) and light REE (Sm). EM-1 has less radiogenic Sr and has lower 
143Nd/144Nd than EM-2. 

They are both thought to represent recycled oceanic crust with the addition of 

small amounts of subducted sediment. That sediment would be of pelagic nature in the 

case of EM-1 and from a terrigenous continental source in the case of EM-2 (Weaver, 

1991). Other possible origins for these components are the recycling of metasomatized 

and melt impregnated oceanic lithosphere (Workman et al., 2004) or of upper 

continental crust (Jackson et al., 2007) for EM-2 and of delaminated subcontinental 

lithosphere for EM-1 (e.g. Hawkesworth et al., 1986) 

On the other hand, Willbold and Stracke (2006) found no clear distinction 

between the EM-1 and EM-2 components in terms of incompatible trace element ratios, 

despite the different isotopic signatures. However, each EM suite has its unique trace 

element signature that must reflect differences in source composition. These authors 

also support the notion that the different isotopic signature of the EM components 

cannot be generated by the incorporation of sediment alone, but also require the input of 

some upper or lower continental crust via subduction erosion. 

 
EM-1: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70530; 143Nd/144Nd 0.51236; 206Pb/204Pb 17.40; 207Pb/204Pb 15.47; 
208Pb/204Pb 38.85; Hart et al., 1992). 

EM-2: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70780; 143Nd/144Nd 0.51258; 206Pb/204Pb 19.00; 207Pb/204Pb 15. 61; 
208Pb/204Pb 38.86; Hart et al., 1992). 

 

A possible fourth component than can go by the name of PREMA (PREvalent 

MAntle), FOZO (FOcal ZOne), C (Common) or PHEM (Primitive HElium Mantle) 

is supposed to represent material from the lower mantle that is present in all mantle 

plumes as a mixing component (e.g. Zindler and Hart, 1986; Hart et al., 1992; Farley et 

al., 1992; Hanan and Graham, 1996; Stracke et al., 2005). It has also been suggested 

that the ubiquitous FOZO is simply the result of continuous subductions and aging of 

oceanic crust during recycling through the mantle (Stracke et al., 2005). 

Compositionally, it is very similar to DMM but has moderately more radiogenic Sr, less 



 

65 
 

radiogenic Nd and Hf and significantly more radiogenic Pb (Hofmann, 2003 and 

references therein).  

The origin of many of these mantle components by recycling of oceanic 

lithosphere has been recently backed up by seismic tomography data that shows 

subducting slabs penetrating deep into the Earth down to circa 2900 km, near the core-

mantle boundary (e.g. Burke and Torsvik, 2004 and references therein), where many of 

these plumes are thought to originate.  

An alternative for the requirement of different mantle end members formed by 

recycling of lithospheric slabs of different nature is to assume that the melts result from 

different degrees of partial melting from peridotite and eclogites derived from 

heterogeneous, recycled lithosphere with different ages and composition that form a 

marble cake like mantle (e.g. Armienti and Gasperini, 2007). This would also provide 

an explanation for the observed small scale variability of isotopic signatures observed, 

for instance, in only one island.  

  Hirschmann et al. (2003) suggest that alkali trace element enriched melts with 

strong recycling signatures can be produced simply from melting of mantle pyroxenites 

at high pressure, although this conclusion was later challenged by Keshav et al. (2004) 

and is still the object of lively debate with other authors (e.g, see Lustrino, 2005 and 

references therein) defending the importance of the role of pyroxenites on the genesis of 

OIB. 

 

3.2 Anorogenic Intraplate Continental Alkaline magmatism and global 

tectonic processes 

 

Anorogenic Intraplate alkaline magmatism can be related to several types of 

geodynamic contexts: continental rifting, the action of mantle plumes, lithospheric 

delamination, edge driven convection and movement across lithospheric strike-slip 

faults. 

 In this section the magma generation and ascent mechanisms for each of these 

geodynamic settings will be discussed. 

 

 



 

66 
 

3.2.1 Continental Rifting 

 

During tectonic extension of a continental lithosphere with normal thickness, 

magmatism can be inhibited for several reasons, the most relevant probably being the 

duration of the extensive pulses (Keen et al., 1994, Ziegler et al., 2004). If the 

separating continental blocks do not have their motion constrained laterally, rifting will 

be quick and extension more localized and will not result in the eruption of a significant 

magma volume since the generated melts will concentrate on the rift axis and be rapidly 

consumed when oceanization and oceanic crust generations begins (Harry and Bowling, 

1999; Ziegler et al., 2004, fig. 2.24).  

Alternatively, White (1992) argues that low extension rates allow for conductive 

cooling of the ascending asthenospheric mantle, which stops it from melting by 

adiabatical decompression. 

Also, as discussed above, the thickness of the lithosphere will control the 

amount of partial fusion for a mantle at a certain potential temperature, with the partial 

melt fraction increasing as the lithospheric thickness decreases.  

Therefore, alkaline magmas should be mostly associated with the first rifting 

phases, before the amount of partial melting increases tholeiitic melts are generated. As 

decompression of normal CML should not result in magma generation unless there is 

addition of fluids and/or heat, the source for these alkaline melts generated during 

rifting should be associated with upwelling asthenosphere or mantle plumes. Some 

authors have even suggested (e.g. Asmeron et al., 1994) that changing from higher to 

lower thinning rates during rifting would firstly induce melting on the metasomatized 

lithospheric mantle due to the heat addition provided by the ascent of the asthenosphere, 

originating basic alkaline melts with low ?Nd. 

Consequently, the eruption sequence observed during continental rifting should 

first show alkaline melts with lithospheric signatures that would become progressively 

more asthenospheric and less alkaline until finally they show tholeiitic characteristics 

(e.g. Furman, 1995; MacDonald et al., 2001). However, Reiners (2002) refers that Os 

isotope data indicates that extraction of melt increased with depth, with the tholeiitic 

melts coming from deeper 187Os/188Os enriched fertile sources such as pyroxenites and 

the alkalic ones deriving from shallower, 187Os/188Os depleted peridotites. 



 

67 
 

In the Rio Grande rift, the alkaline magmatism of the Potrillo volcanic field is 

characterized by trace element enrichment, higher 87Sr/86Sr and lower 143Nd/144Nd than 

DMM. This event has been attributed to the fusion of lithospheric mantle 

metasomatized by the infiltration of melts during a previous magmatic event that 

promoted the formation of metasomatic amphibole, lowered its solidus and enriched it 

in incompatible elements (Thompson et al., 2005). The trigger for the initiation of the 

magmatism was the extension and thinning that took place in the area, coupled with the 

ascent of a convective mantle cell. 

 

 
Fig. 2.24: Representation of the model for magma production by Harry and Bowling. From Harry and 
Bowling, 1999. 

 
3.2.2 Mantle plumes and their interactions with the lithosphere 

 

Along with lithospheric thickness, the temperature of the sublithospheric mantle 

is also a crucial controlling factor in what concerns the location and composition of the 

generated magmas. 

The hotter the asthenosphere, the greater the depth of initiation of melting and 

the greater the volume of magma produced in the upwelling mantle, even in the absence 

of significant lithosphere thinning. Therefore high potential temperature mantle plumes 

are of great importance in the generation of continental magmatism. Also, even 



 

68 
 

relatively small temperature anomalies can generate partial melts that can metasomatize 

the overlying lithosphere or trigger melting in an already metasomatized lithospheric 

mantle. 

 

 

 
Fig. 2.25: Schematic representation of the effects of the impact of a plume on the base of the lithosphere. 
Upper and lower diagrams impact on unthinned lithosphere and on a previously thinned lithosphere, 
respectively. 
 

 Another phenomenon commonly associated with mantle plumes is the uplift and 

thermal erosion usually associated with the impingement of a plume at the base of the 

lithosphere (fig. 2.25). The thermal erosion of the lithosphere, associated with the 

higher potential temperatures of the plume, can greatly increase the melt production on 

the impact site and is usually quoted as one of the causes for the formation of LIPs and 

may even evolve towards extension and continental rifting (e.g. Morgan, 1983; Wilson, 



 

69 
 

1989; Saunders et al., 1992; Wilson, 1993, Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004). In other cases, 

the impact of a plume head on lithosphere that is already being rifted results in an 

increase of the deviatoric stresses which would intensify the ongoing rifting (Morgan, 

1983; Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004; fig. 2.25). 

 Such interactions make it harder to distinguish the lithospheric from the 

asthenospheric and plume components with mixed signatures being the most likely 

outcome in many continental intraplate basic magmas. 

 Magmas enriched in incompatible elements, with moderate 87Sr/86Sr, low 
206Pb/204Pb and ?Nd, and Th/Nb &gt;1 are generally associated to assimilation, mixing and 

hybridization of asthenospheric DMM-like magmas and CLM melts, while negative 

anomalies in Nb, Ta, Sr and P, high 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, La/Nb and Th/Nb are usually 

attributed to crustal contamination processes (Saunders et al., 1992).      

 The present day magmatism observed in the East and West African rifts is 

considered to result from the interaction between mantle plumes and the CLM (e.g. 

Furman, 1995; Furman and Graham, 1999; MacDonald et al., 2001; Spath et al., 2001). 

These interactions are thought to be responsible for extensive metasomatism observed 

in the CLM within this region, mostly due to the action of carbonatitic and silicate 

melts.  

 For example, these metasomatic events resulted in the formation of residual 

amphibole, ilmenite, apatite and zircon in the CLM of the Rungwe area, between the 

East and the West African rifts, that later controlled the trace element compositions of 

the magmas generated by partial melting of this source (Furman, 1995). 

 In the Kivu province of the East African rift, the differences in composition of 

the observed magmas is related to changes on the thickness of the lithosphere in the area 

which in turn are controlled by lithospheric extension and thermo-mechanical erosion of 

the TBL (Furman and Graham, 1999). These authors also found that the main 

contributions to this magmatism come from the melting of metasomatized CML 

(87Sr/86Sr ? 0.7050, ?Nd ? 0 and 206Pb/204Pb ? 19) and from a plume with an HIMU like 

composition whose role is more important in regions with thinner lithosphere. 

MacDonald et al., (2001) studied basalts from the Kenya Rift and came to the similar 

conclusions, identifying plume and lithospheric mantle components in the rocks of that 

region, although it has also been suggested that only the metasomatized CLM was 

involved in the genesis of these basalts, with the observed different isotopic signatures 



 

70 
 

corresponding to melts coming from areas with different degrees of metasomatic 

enrichment (Späth et al., 2001).  

 Fodor et al. (1998) found evidence for a lithospheric component with an EM-1 

like composition (relatively high 87Sr/86Sr, high Ba/Nb and low La/Nb) in the Cenozoic 

basalts of NE Brazil that mixed with melts resulting from the fusion of the HIMU like 

Fernando Noronha plume and surrounding asthenosphere (DMM). 

   

 
Fig. 2.26: Schematic representation of the effects of the impact of the Tristan plume on the  lithosphere of 
the African plate in Namibia. From Le Roex and Lanyon, 1998. 

 
The passage of a mantle plume under continental lithosphere can, in addition to 

being associated with contemporaneous magmatism, also be responsible for 

metasomatism in the CLM that will allow it to melt if there is later extension or heat 

addition, originating late alkaline magmatic events. That seems to be the case in 

Namibia, where the late alkaline lamprophyres and carbonatites studied by Le Roex and 



 

71 
 

Lanyon (1998) were generated by the low degree melting of CLM that had been 

previously metasomatized by the passage of the Tristan plume. These rocks show 

isotopic signatures similar to others associated with this plume since they were 

metasomatized by fluids originating in it (relatively high 87Sr/86Sr, low 143Nd/144Nd and 

Pb isotopic ratios that project under the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line) but 

erupted later, when the plume’s thermal anomaly was already residual (fig. 2.26).  

The same kind of explanation is used to justify the late, post-rift magmatism of 

the eastern coast of Greenland (Price et al., 1997; Bernstein et al., 1998; Storey et al., 

2004), with the Iceland plume being responsible for the metasomatism of the CLM and 

the diffuse extension that took place in the area due to the contemporaneous northern 

propagation of rifting (Price et al., 1997) or the decompression resulting from erosion 

and subsequent isostatic adjustment (Storey et al., 2004). 

Other authis even argue that plumes can be channeled under continents, through 

corridors of thinned lithosphere and be responsible for intraplate continental magmatism 

as well as further lithosphere delamination on the same corridor (e.g. the Atlas Cenozoic 

alkaline magmatism, Duggen et al., 2009, fig. 2.27) 

 

 
Fig. 2.27: Representation of the model of Duggen et al. (2009) for the generation of the Atlas magmatism 
by channeling of material from the Canaries plume through thinned lithosphere. 

 

In summary, the interactions between CLM and mantle plumes can be used to 

explain the existence of alkaline magmatism in different geodynamic contexts: sin-



 

72 
 

rifting magmatism (e.g. East and West African rifts) and post-rifting magmatism (e.g. 

East Greenland). The plume contribution can be limited to supplying the thermal 

anomaly that will trigger melting or to the metasomatism the overlying CLM (e.g. 

Furman, 1995; Gibson et al., 1995; Furman e Graham, 1999; Späth et al., 2001) or the 

plume head may as well actively melt and contribute more directly to the volume of the 

observed magmatism (e.g. Furman and Graham, 1999; MacDonald et al., 2001). 

Alternatively, a plume can contribute simultaneously with both direct melting and 

indirect melting from lithosphere that was previously metasomatized by fluids deriving 

from it (Gibson et al., 1995; Le Roux e Lanyon, 1998; Furman e Graham, 1999; Larsen 

et al., 2003). 

 
3.2.3 Delamination of the CLM 

 

Metamorphic reactions occurred during continental collision can lead to an 

increase of the density of the lithospheric roots of the thickened continental area, 

leading to its gravitational destabilization and consequential delamination causing the 

lithospheric root to sink into the asthenosphere (Lustrino, 2005, fig. 2.28). 

The space released by the delaminated lithospheric keel will then be filled by 

upwelling asthenosphere which would react with the silica rich continental crust, to 

form orthopyroxene rich domains with strong crustal signatures, before asthenospheric 

accretion takes place by conductive cooling, forming a new subcontinental lithosphere. 

The delaminated keel will also start to dehydrate and melt, releasing liquids that would 

metasomatize the overlying newly formed lithosphere (Lustrino, 2005, fig. 2.27). 

These metasomatized crust and lithospheric mantle can remain static for several 

million years until they another geological process (e.g. extension) induces partial 

melting, generating basaltic liquids with trace element and isotopic signatures similar to 

EM-1, with 87Sr/86Sr ? 0.706; 143Nd/144Nd ? 0.5121; 206Pb/204Pb ? 17 and 176Hf/177Hf ? 

0.2826 (Lustrino, 2005).

keel, it will later cool and become lithospheric mantle; that metasomatized lithosphere can melt and origin

3.2.4 Edge driven convection  

 

Small convective cells can form on the asthenosphere located near the edge of 

cratons due to horizontal temperature gradients between the cold cratonic lithosphere 

that provides thermal insulation to the underlying warmer asthenosphere, and the 

oceanic lithosphere that is warmer than the cratonic lithosphere, but is coupled with an 

asthenosphere that in its turn is not as warm as the one underneath the craton.  



 

74 
 

This difference induces downwelling of asthenospheric material close to the 

craton’s edge that is compensated by upwelling between 600 and 1000 km away from 

the same edge where decompression melting would occur and give rise to magmatism 

(Vogt, 1991; King and Ritsema, 2000; fig. 2.29). These convective instabilities in the 

upper mantle can also form following lithospheric delamination (Elkins Tanton and 

Hager, 2000). 

 

 
Fig. 2.29: Edge driven convection forming where a mantle temperature perturbation was added to an 
otherwise isothermal mantle beneath the boundary layer structure illustrated by the isotherms. The size of 
the mantle temperature perturbation varies from about 3°C to 150°C. From King and Anderson, 1998. 
 

This hypothesis was developed to explain the Bermuda swell as an alternative 

explanation to generation by the action of a mantle plume (Vogt, 1991), and continued 

work involving numerical modeling of edge driven convection suggests that this process 

can responsible by the high magmatic productivity rates observed in LIPs located in the 

edge of cratons, by continuously supplying more material to the part of the mantle being 

subject to partial melting (King and Anderson, 1998). This would eliminate the need for 



 

75 
 

the presence of thermal anomalies and associated mantle plumes and explain the high 

volume of magmas produced in certain locations (King and Anderson, 1998). 

More recently, seismic tomography and numerical modeling study suggested 

that several island and submarine seamount chains and even their counterparts in 

continental margins do not correspond to hotspot tracks but to the superficial expression 

of such small scale convective cells (King and Ritsema, 2000). 

Edge driven convection was also the mechanism proposed by Matton and Jébrak 

(2009) to explain the magmatism associated with the continental Peri-Atlantic Alkaline 

Pulse (PAAP). The PAAP includes intrusive and extrusive alkaline events in passive 

margins in the North, Central and South Atlantic which these authors have attributed to 

magmas generated by decompression of the asthenosphere due to edge driven 

convection that later ascended through reactivated lithospheric faults (Matton and 

Jébrak, 2009). 

 
3.2.5 Reactivation of translithospheric faults 

 

Black et al., (1985) argued that many of the alkaline provinces that appear 

aligned, but do not show any sort of spatial age progression, are actually the result of 

magma generation and ascent along translithospheric transfer faults, whose age 

distribution reflects changes in relative plate motions due to plate reorganization or 

orogenic events in their edge. 

In this kind of geodynamic context, the movement along the fault increases 

temperature and reduces viscosity with depth, due to the increased shear stress at the 

base of the lithosphere. This would lead to decompression, metasomatism and volatile 

addition to the lithosphere that could ultimately lead to partial melting and the ascent of 

these melts through the faults and to the surface (Black et al., 1985). 

The inversion of the direction of movement along the same fault system can lead 

to the propagation of tensil fractures down to the asthenosphere, and repeat the process 

of magma formation and ascent mentioned above, creating a different phase of 

magmatism (Black et al., 1985). 

The Cenozoic magmatism in Hoggar, NW Africa, is justified as a consequence 

of the reactivation of mega shear zones, formed during the Proterozoic Pan-African 

orogeny. This reactivation took place due to intraplate stresses caused by the collision 



 

76 
 

between the African and Eurasian plates. This process led to linear lithosphere 

delamination along the shear zones and consequential ascent, decompression and partial 

melting of the asthenosphere and metasomatized lithosphere (Liégeois et al., 2005). The 

magmas generated during this process occur along the Pan-African shear zones, have 

mantle signatures corresponding to mixes between the EM-1 and HIMU components 

and their ages agree with the major Cenozoic collision phases between Africa and 

Eurasia (Liégeois et al., 2005). 

 

 
 

Fig. 2.30: Two representations of the hypothesis advanced by Vaughan and Scarrow to the formation of 
strike-slip faults in regions subjected to potassic metasomatism. From Vaughan and Scarrow (2003). 

 

A similar mechanism is cited by Harmand and Cantagrel (1984) to justify the 

alkaline magmatism that accompanies the several deformation phases of the Atlas chain, 

with the difference that the reactivated faults were generated during Mesozoic 

continental rifting. Localized decompression and melting of previously metasomatized 

lithosphere along translithospheric fractures is also used to explain the Cenozoic 



 

77 
 

alkaline magmatism and its isotopic signature (87Sr/86Sr 0.70299–0.70372, ?Nd 4.2–6.3) 

of the Ross Embayment area in Antarctica (Rocchi et al., 2002). 

Vaughan and Scarrow (2003), however, propose a reverse relation between 

metasomatism and faulting. They suggest that potassic mantle metasomatism by K-rich 

melts resulting from small amounts of asthenospheric partial melting control the 

nucleation of translithospheric structures. For these authors, a local or regional 

transtensive stress field will tend to use areas that were previously the target of potassic 

metasomatism as nucleation points for shear zones or strike-slip structures.  This will 

also trigger small amounts of extension, decompression and associated partial melting. 

These melts will then infiltrate the lithosphere, concentrating deformation and 

promoting further nucleation and propagation of fractures along the lithosphere, until 

they reach the surface, accompanied by contemporaneous potassic magmatism (fig. 

2.30).

4. Sample collection 
 

 
Fig. 4.1: General map showing all the sampled locations. 

 
Several samples representative of the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle were 

collected both on the onshore and offshore West Iberian Margin. The aim of this 

sampling campaign was to characterize the geochemistry of the more primitive rocks, 



 

79 
 

their source, and to provide additional constrainsts to the geochronology of the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline cycle. Morever, it this study will allow the detection of possible 

geochemical variations with age and/or location of the collected samples. 

 

 Fig. 4.2: Map showing the sampled locations in the Lisbon region. 

 



 

80 
 

The samples were gathered during a time interval from 2006 to 2008 and 

subsequently processed in the sample preparation laboratories of GeoFCUL to allow for 

detailed petrographic, geochemical and geochronological studies.  
The collected samples belong primarily to the most basic lithologies in each 

complex, so that the effects of crustal contamination could be minimized and the 

original source signatures better distinguished. 

The sample locations are summarized on figures 4.1 and 4.2 and listed along 

with the respective geographic coordinates in annex I. 

The samples from the Monchique complex collected and described by Clavijo 

and Valadares (2003) and Valadares (2004) were also integrated in this study resulting 

in the addition of further mineral chemistry and isotopic geochemistry data. 

 

4.1 Onshore sampling 

  
4.1.1. The Lisbon Volcanic Complex 

 
Several of the occurrences associated with the Lisbon Volcanic Complex (LVC) 

were sampled (fig. 4.2). Namely the basal and top flows of its basic lava sequence, 

some of the associated necks, and also several of the basic to intermediate sills and 

plugs associated to the complex. 

 

- The lava flows: 

The basal lava flows are exposed on the contact between the LVC lava pile and 

the Cenomanian limestones. The basal unit always occurs on top of a pyroclastic 

sequence with variable thickness, which itself overlays a paleokarst formed on the 

limestone. The pyroclastic sequence can also show some signs of previous erosion, with 

the lava flows filling paleochannels on the pyroclastic layer, as can be seen in Negrais 

(fig. 4.3). 

Samples of the basal unit were collected near Lexim, (RM 7), Negrais (RM 42-

45), Fanhões (RM 69-74), Ramada (RM 79-80), Bolores (RM 59-61), and Ponte de 

Lousa (RM 40-41), for coordinates see annex I. 



 

81 
 

This unit constituted by alkaline basalts which are usually moderately to lightly 

porphyritic, with olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts in a dark grey matrix with few 

vesicles filled by secondary calcite or zeolite. Some amphibole phenocrysts are also 

observed in Negrais. Alteration is more important in Bolores, Ponte de Lousa and some 

of the Ramada and Fanhões samples. 

Due to important erosional events that took place during the Cenozoic and even 

in recent times, the topmost unit that was sampled is not likely to correspond to the last 

effusive event of the LVC. The samples from the highest position in the stratigraphic 

sequence of the lava pile were collected in Ramada (RM 102) and near Murteira (RM 

103) (fig. 4.3) and correspond to more or less altered porphyritic basalts with abbundat 

olivine and scarcer clinopyroxene phenocrysts. The most altered samples show 

chloritized or serpentinized olivines and thin calcite veins. 

 

 
Fig. 4.3: The basal LVC flow filling a paleovalley in the LVC pyroclasts near Negrais, in the area where 

samples RM 42-45 were collected.  

 

Porphyritic basalts with clinopyroxene and olivine phenocrysts and also some 

aphanitic basalts were recovered from outcrops in the small Runa basin, near Torres 

Vedras (RM 34-35). However, these outcrops mostly consist of sparse boulders on 

cultivated areas, with little or no field relations visible between them or with the 

remaining lithologies present in the region. Therefore, their stratigraphic position and 

occurrence mode could not be accurately determined and evaluated. Also, most of the 

rocks are quite altered, so no further studies were made with these samples. 



 

82 
 

- The necks: 

Several basaltic necks across the LVC were sampled for this study. They intrude 

marls and limestones of Albian-Cenomanian age or the sandstones, limestones and 

mudstones of the Barremian-Aptian “Grés de Almargem” unit. 

 These necks (fig. 4.4) commonly display two different facies, the fine grained, 

often aphanitic marginal facies and the coarser central facies, both of which were 

sampled.  

The coarser interior facies can be very porphyritic, displaying milimetric 

clinopyroxene and olivine crystals. Samples taken from these occurrences are mostly 

fresh, with the only signs of alteration being some reddish altered olivines and the 

presence of carbonate and zeolites filling vesicles and secondary fractures. 

 

 
Fig. 4.4: The Lexim (left) and Torre da Besueira (right) necks, showing columnar jointing. 

 

The sampled necks were Monte Serves (RM 65-66), Torre da Besueira (RM 1-

3), Montemuro (RM 57-58), Funchal (RM 93-94), Gare de Mafra (RM 92), Penedo do 

Lexim (RM 4-6) located between Vialonga, Negrais and Malveira, and the Serra do 

Socorro (RM 26-28) and nearby São Sebastião necks (RM 29-30), further to the north 

(fig. 4.2). 

 

- The plugs: 

Three small, half sphere shaped plugs outcrop in the abrasion platform of the 

Ribeira d’Ilhas beach (fig. 4.5) intruding the sandstones, limestones and mudstones the 

Aptian-Albian “Belasiano” unit. They are also related to small sills that occur on the 



 

83 
 

country rock above them and to irregular shaped dykes made out of similar material 

(fig. 4.5). 

In general, these rocks are very porphyritic and rich in centimetric xenoliths and 

xenocrysts that are scattered in a black groundmass. Most of the phenocrysts observed 

are amphibole and pyroxene, with auxiliary olivine. Both the south (RM 36) and central 

(RM 37) plugs were sampled. 

The interior of the central and largest plug is more altered than its chilled 

margin, displaying a greener color, abundant vesicles and completely altered olivines. 

 

 
Fig. 4.5: The Ribeira d’Ilhas plugs. On the right you can also observe the irregularly shaped dyke 

associated with the south plug outcropping in the cliff behind it. 

 

- The Oeiras-Cascais dykes: 

These dykes outcrop mostly in the abrasion platform and cliffs of the beaches 

near the cities of Oeiras and Cascais (fig. 4.6). 

Many of them intruded pre-existing fractures that cut the Lower Cretaceous 

sedimentary units that outcrop in that area. Their maximum thickness rarely exceeds 

2m.  

These fractures were reactivated after the intrusion of the dykes, during the 

inversion of the Lusitanian basin. This promoted intense fracturation and fluid 

circulation in many of them, which caused significant alteration, namely oxidation and 

carbonatization of the original magmatic rocks and filling of the fractures with 

secondary carbonate material. 



 

84 
 

The dykes show two preferential directions: NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE, but no 

crosscut criteria were observed between them. The NNE-SSW direction seems to be 

more abundant between the Parede-Estoril sector, while the NNW-SSE appears to 

dominate from Estoril to Cabo Raso (see fig. 4.2). 

They also divide themselves compositionally between very porphyritic olivine 

and clinopyroxene basalts and plagioclase and amphibole phyritic hawaiites with 

abundant carbonate filled vesicles.  

Both these types occur in the two observed directional trends, although the 

basalts seem to intrude predominantly NNE-SSW fractures. Sometimes it is also 

possible to observe a linear basaltic dyke surrounded by what seems to be a more 

irregular trending, more evolved dyke, but again, the relation between the two is 

unclear. 

 

 
Fig. 4.6: Several dykes outcropping in the marine abrasion platform in the Avencas (left) and Parede 

(right) beaches between Cascais and Oeiras. The larger dyke on Avencas beach is of basaltic nature while 

the other two are trachybasaltic. 
 

In this region, several dykes were sampled between the Parede and Tamariz 

beaches (RM 52-54; 62-64; 87-91), but only three of them were fresh enough to study, 

namely the aphanitic basaltic dyke in the beach in front of the Parede sanatorium (RM 

52), the porphyritic basalt that outcrops in Bafureira beach (RM 64) and the porphyritic 

hawaiite with plagioclase phenocrysts just west of Praia da Poça (RM 90). 

 

- The sills: 

Several sills with compositions ranging from basic to acidic and nepheline 

normative to quartz normative have been included in the LVC by several authors (e.g. 



 

85 
 

Palácios, 1985). They are mostly found closer to the Sintra igneous complex but also 

occur in other locations. 

For this work, the more basic sills were sampled as well as some of the 

intermediate ones, in order to understand the processes that characterized the magmatic 

evolution of the complex. 

 

The Lomba dos Pianos sill (fig. 4.2) was sampled (RM 9-10) in an abandoned 

quarry north of Magoito beach, that is presently being used as a landfill. The sill shows 

a thickness of around 10m in that location and intrudes marls and limestones of Albian-

Cenomanian age (fig. 4.7). 

The rock is melanocratic and porphyritic, with plagioclase and clinopyroxene 

phenocrysts in a dark matrix. The outcrop shows abundant zeolite filling in fractures 

and cavities.  

 

 
Fig. 4.7: The Lomba dos Pianos sill (top) and two aspects of the Anços sill (bottom). 

 

The Montelevar sill (fig. 4.2) intrudes marls and limestones of Albian-

Cenomanian age and was sampled in a construction site next to the Montelevar 



 

86 
 

cemetery (RM 49-50) where the sill was well exposed and relatively fresh. Neither the 

top nor bottom portions of the sill were exposed in this location making it impossible to 

estimate its thickness. 

The rock is medium grained and, viewed in hand sample, constituted mostly by 

plagioclase with some clinopyroxene. Alteration was important with some of the 

minerals looking brown due to oxidation and clay alteration. 

 

The Anços sill intrudes (fig. 4.2) marls and limestones of Albian-Cenomanian 

age and was sampled in two different locations: in a quarry near Rebanque (RM 67-68, 

fig. 4.7) and in a road cut along the road that connects Anços and Maceira (RM 55). On 

the quarry, the top of the sill dipps approximately 12º South and is approximately 20m 

thick. No layering or other internal structure was distinguished within the sill.  

The samples show a porphyroid texture with plagioclase and pyroxene 

phenocrysts in a finer grained matrix. All of the samples showed some alteration, with 

the mafic minerals and some plagioclases transforming into phyllossilicates. 

 

The Eiras do Faião sill (fig. 4.2) is located near the previously mentioned sills 

and intrudes the same stratigraphic unit. It was sampled in outcrops exposed near the 

locality with the same name (RM 46-47). The sill displays a very fine grained texture 

and abundant vesicles filled with orange to pink zeolites. Some rare centimetric 

xenoliths are also observed. 

 

The Alqueidão sill (fig. 4.2) near Sobral de Monte Agraço was also sampled but 

its samples proved to be too altered to pursuit further studies. This sill intrudes Upper 

Jurassic (Tithonian) rocks, has a medium grained texture, and is constituted mostly by 

plagioclase and clinopyroxene.  

 
4.1.2. The Malveira da Serra sill 

 
This sill is located in the southern flank of the Sintra intrusion and has been 

attributed to a first phase of igneous activity in the region that preceded the installation 

of the granite laccolith (e.g. Kullberg and Kullberg, 2000). 



 

87 
 

It outcrops on a roadcut just outside Malveira da Serra, where it intrudes 

limestones of Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian age. It is a very porphyritic rock with abundant 

clinopyroxene and amphibole phenocrysts in an aphanitic matrix (RM 25). 

 

4.1.3. The Mafra plug  

 
This gabbroic plug was sampled in a construction site near Almada (RM 83), 

just outside of Mafra (fig. 4.2). The rock was quite altered but some fresh boulders 

separated by disaggregated alteration zones were sampled. Near this outcrop another 

mesocratic, porphyritic igneous rock with plagioclase and an altered mafic mineral 

phenocrysts occurred, but no age relation between these two was observed. 

The Mafra gabbroic rock is similar to the gabbros present in Sintra, with large 

amphibole and clinopyroxene aggregates giving it a glomoporphyric texture. However, 

this rock possesses a finer matrix between the more porphyritic phases and is also less 

altered showing a darker grey colour. 

In the vicinities of this gabbroic plug, many other igneous rocks are present in 

the shapes of dykes and of what may be sills. They are altered and often more evolved, 

varying from melano to mesocratic and usually porphyritic, showing plagioclase and 

mafic mineral phenocrysts, but the alteration makes their classification a difficult task. 

 
4.1.4. The Foz da Fonte sill 

 
The 8m thick Foz da Fonte sill (fig. 4.2) outcrops for an extension of 

approximately 200 m at a N-S coastal section in the Setúbal peninsula (fig. 4.8), south 

of Lisbon, and intrudes sedimentary sequence of Aptian age (Kullberg, 2000).  

 

 
Fig. 4.8: The Foz da Fonte sill in a general view (left) and a detail of its upper contact (right). 



 

88 
 

It is a fine grained melanocratic rock with abundant, carbonate filled vesicles 

towards its top (fig. 4.8). Its samples correspond to FF 2-4. 

 
4.1.5. The Paço d’Ilhas sill 

 
The Paço d’Ilhas sill was sampled in a quarry near the locality with the same 

name (PI 1-11). Sections of this sill with approximately 20m thickness are exposed in 

the quarry walls and the top contact between sill and Lower Cretaceous sediments 

(Albian and Aptian-Barremian sandstones and limestones) is also observed. The sill is a 

layered intrusion and both the fine grained melanocratic monzogabbroic layers and the 

mesocratic monzosyenitic layers were sampled. 

 
4.1.6. The Sintra mafic rocks 

 
The Sintra gabbros, also known as mafraites (Matos Alves, 1964), occur in 

several distinct outcrops inside the Sintra intrusive complex. Two of these were 

sampled, the Peninha (RM 11-17) and the Azóia (RM 18-23) outcrops, both of which 

are part of the Cabo da Roca complex (see section 2.3.1.1). 

 

 
Fig. 4.9: Details of the Sintra gabbros in the Azoía (left) and Peninha (right) outcrops. 
 

The Peninha gabbros contact with syenite and igneous breccias (e.g. Ramalho et 

al., 2001). They were collected on a roadcut along a forest road near Peninha and show 

significant heterogeneity in terms of grain size (fig. 4.9) and preferred mineral 

orientation. 

All samples show plagioclase, amphibole and pyroxene but these may range in 

grain size from medium to coarse and almost pegmatitic. Amphiboles and pyroxenes 



 

89 
 

can either display a preferential orientation or form aggregates in a characteristic 

glomoporphyric texture. Some alteration and secondary veins are visible but overall, 

alteration is not very important in these rocks. 

The Azóia outcrop corresponds to a series of boulders inside a walled terrain 

near the village of Azóia. These rocks are very coarse grained, and show plagioclase, 

amphibole and pyroxene as well as abundant green alteration minerals and light colored 

secondary veins that sometimes showed epidote rich centers. The same glomoporphyric 

texture that was observed in Peninha is also present here (fig. 4.9). 

The diorite was sampled on a roadcut between Malveira da Serra and Biscaia, 

near the entrance to Quinta da Tomélia (RM 24). It is a medium grained rock showing 

plagioclase, amphibole and biotite and some greenish alteration products. 

 
4.1.7. The Sines mafic rocks 

 
The Sines gabbros occur in two distinct outcrops within the complex, one in the 

North, near Pedras Negras and the other in the South, closer to the Sines city center.  

 

 
Fig. 4.10: Details of the Sines gabbros at Praia Vasco da Gama (top left) and Pedras negras outcrops 

showing crosscutting dykes (top right) and apparent compositional layering (bottom left and right). 



 

90 
 

The southern outcrop was sampled at Praia Vasco da Gama (RM 96-98), and 

contacts with diorites in the south and with syenites in the west. These rocks are coarse 

grained, with amphibole crystals that can be several centimeters long (fig. 4.10). In hand 

specimen, amphibole, plagioclase, and some green alteration products can be observed. 

The amphiboles can in some places show the same glomoporphyric texture observed in 

Sintra and Mafra. 

The northern Pedras Negras outcrop (RM 99-101) contacts with Jurassic 

limestones to the North and syenite to the South. It appears to show some layering (fig. 

4.10) which is not horizontal, probably reflecting accumulation parallel to the walls of 

the magma chamber. This gabbro is profusely intruded by later mafic and felsic dykes. 

It is medium to coarse grained with distinguishable olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase. 

The diorite contacts with the Paleozoic metassediments to the south and with the 

gabbros to the north. It was sampled just south of Praia Vasco da Gama and is a 

medium to coarse grained rock, with a lighter color than the gabbros and constituted by 

abundant plagioclase and biotite and clinopyroxene. 

 
4.1.8. The Monchique mafic and ultramafic rocks 

 
These samples were provided by Vasco Valadares. For the location and 

description of these samples, see Clavijo and Valadares (2003) and Valadares (2004) 

and for more information on the Monchique igneous complex, go to section 2.3.1.3. 
 
4.1.9. The Loulé dykes 

 

 
Fig. 4.11: Loulé dykes inside the salt mine appearing still with a tabular shape (left) and as a boundin 

(right). 

 



 

91 
 

These dykes outcrop inside the Loulé salt diapir and were sampled with the 

permission of the CUF group. They are frequently very deformed, being often folded 

and separated into individual boudins (fig. 4.11). They were sampled inside the Loulé 

salt mine in galleries C-20 and C-12-1.  

Dyke C-20 is around 2m thick and showed abundant igneous and metamorphic 

xenoliths in its centre but none in the margin. The sampled margin was fresh and 

porphyritic with pyroxene and biotite phenocrysts. 

Dyke C-12-1 is less than 1m thick and shows altered olivine phenocrysts in an 

aphanitic groundmass. 

 

4.2 Offshore sampling 

 
Given the recent identification of large volumes of Late Cretaceous alkaline 

magmatism in the offshore WIM (e.g. Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006, 

2009), an attempt was made to complement the sampling of these occurrences. 

 
4.2.1 The Fontanelas seamount 

 

 
Fig. 4.12: Magnetic anomalies between Sintra and the Tore seamount. Figure by Mário Moreira. 

 

On the summer of 2008, as a part of the MAGMAFLUX research project 

(POCTI/CTA/48450/2002), one day of dredging took place on board the RV Professor 



 

92 
 

Logachev, during the TTR-17 cruise, allowing for sampling of the Fontanelas 

seamount. 

This seamount is located 100 km west of Ericeira (fig. 4.12, 4.13) and was 

selected as a sampling target among a series of magnetic anomalies occurring in the 

Estremadura Spur, between the Sintra igneous complex and the Tore seamount (see 

section 2.3.2.2, fig. 4.12). It was chosen due to its shallower depth (top at approximately 

-1250m and base at around -1600m; fig. 4.13), which facilitated dredging operations on 

board.  

High resolution multibeam bathymetry and magnetic anomaly data provided by 

the “Estrutura de Missão para a Extensão da Plataforma Continental” (EMEPC) and 

processed by members of the team in the MAGMAFLUX project were crucial during 

the identification of the targets and planning of the sampling campaign. Also, a dive 

with the onboard TV-Grab device that preceded the dredging, allowed for the 

unequivocal identification of outcropping basic igneous rocks before the sampling with 

a round dredge.

A total of five successful dredge hauls were recovered along the top and flanks 

of the seamount (fig. 4.14, table 4.1). The contents of the dredges varied from having 

more or less brown pelagic mud, biogenic material (mainly dead coral of different sizes 

and ages but also some sponges and numerous cirripedia plates), igneous rocks, 

allochthonous material (probably dropstones and rocks used as weights in fishing nets) 

as well as occasionally abundant phosphate and Fe-Mn nodules and crusts. 



 

93 
 

The recovered pieces of igneous rocks were mostly fragments of pillow lavas 

that sometimes even displayed the characteristic breadcrumb textures (fig. 4.15). They 

ranged in size from boulders with a diameter of approximately 10 cm to one entire 

pillow with over 40 cm diameter.

The pillow lavas consisted of very vesicular and altered basalts with a greenish 

to brown color. In most cases the vesicles were filled with carbonate and clay minerals. 

Many of the pillow lavas were also covered with a mantle of Fe-Mn oxides of variable

thickness and could display corals growing on top. The high vesicle abundance is 

suggestive of extensive degassing of volatile rich lava. 

The lavas display a porphyritic texture, with phenocrysts of fresh pyroxene and 

amphibole accompanying much altered olivine set in an equally altered groundmass.

Some breccias made of mostly clasts of altered basalt cemented by carbonate 

were also sampled.  

The dredged nodules are rounded and can either exhibit concentric layers of Fe-

Mn oxides or be of mainly phosphate nature, with only a thin Fe-Mn oxide cover. The 

crusts that were sampled along with the nodules show similar compositions and features 

but do not have a round shape, showing flat, irregular shapes. 

The allochthonous material seems to have diverse origins. Some of it 

corresponded to sedimentary rocks, mostly limestones but there were also high grade 

metamorphic rocks with gneissic or granulitic textures and even a tholeiitic basalt. It is 

likely that they may correspond to weights put in fishing nets that were lost by 

fisherman or correspond to dropstones, carried by icebergs to lower latitudes.

5. Geochronology 
 

The geochronological data presented in this section was already discussed in the 

paper “Age constrains on the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism on the West Iberian 

Margin”, authored by R. Miranda, V. Valadares, P. Terrinha, J. Mata, M. do Rosário 

Azevedo, M. Gaspar, J. C. Kullberg, C. Ribeiro and published in 2009 in the journal 

“Cretaceous Research” (vol. 30, pp. 575-586). 

Further sampling took place and during 2009, a total of 13 separates of matrix 

material and amphibole were obtained in order to acquire further geochronological data 

on the LVC (flows and necks), the Cascais dykes, the Sintra gabbros and diorites, the 

Mafra radial dyke swarm, the Malveira da Serra sill and the Fontanelas seamount. 

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen difficulties, the data were not available in time 

to be integrated into this manuscript. 

 

5.1 Previous geochronological work 

The Late Cretaceous alkaline igneous activity in the onshore section of the WIM 

took place in a post rift setting, 30 My after the oceanic break-up in the Tagus Abyssal 

Plain (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Sibuet et al., 2007) and partially coincides with the 

Pyreneean continental collision in Northern Iberia (e.g. Sibuet et al., 2004) and the onset 

of tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic basins (e.g. Mougenot, 1980, Terrinha, 1998, 

Rosembaum et al., 2002), thus making the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism a key 

episode in the history of this passive margin. These rocks have been object of several 

previous dating attempts, summarized in table 5.1.  

As shown in table 5.1, the chronology of the main magmatic events associated 

with the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle has been established on the basis of a large 

number of K-Ar ages and Rb-Sr whole rock isochrons. These two isotopic systems are 

extremely sensitive to post-emplacement disturbance which may explain, at least to 

some extent,  the significant scatter of the published geochronological data (sometimes 

exceding 15 Ma for the same occurrence using one single method, table 5.1). The use of 

more reliable dating techniques (e.g. incremental release 40Ar/39Ar dating and/or U-Pb 

zircon geochronology) is therefore fundamental to obtain precise age constraints. In 

order to refine the geochronology  of  the  Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle, several of the

exposed occurrences were selected for further geochronological studies and/or whole-

rock geochemistry. These include: 

A) the granite from the Sintra laccolith body (Terrinha et al., 2003) that had 

systematically yielded ages older than the suite of gabbro-diorite-syenite and associated 

breccias present in the complex (see table 5.1). 

B) the Foz da Fonte microgranular tephritic sill, which corresponds to the 

southernmost intrusion of the Lusitanian basin.  

C) the syenites of the Sines sub-volcanic intrusion. Of all the known alkaline 

intrusions, this is the occurrence that shows a wider range of ages (table 5.1). 

D) the Monchique alkaline complex. This is the most voluminous of the 

southern alkaline intrusions, as well as the only one emplaced in unrifted Paleozoic 



 

98 
 

basement. The Monchique complex has been dated with both the K-Ar and the Rb-Sr 

method (table 5.1), with the obtained ages clustering around 72 Ma (72.0 ± 2.0 mean K-

Ar ages on mineral separates, MacIntyre &amp;amp; Berger, 1982; 72.0 Ma Rb-Sr whole rock 

isochron, Rock, 1976, Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997), although the K-Ar ages obtained 

for K-feldspar and nepheline separates show some spread, attributed to Ar loss 

(MacIntyre &amp;amp; Berger, 1982). 

E) the ultrabasic lamprophyre dykes that occur within the Loulé salt diapir in the 

Mesozoic Algarve basin. These rocks are representatives of the minor alkaline igneous 

activity hosted in the Algarve Basin.  

 

5.2 New geochronological data  

The samples were prepared for analysis at the Departamento de Geologia da 

Universidade de Lisboa. They were hydraulically crushed, in order to ensure the 

removal of all the signs of alteration, and then reduced in size by a jaw crusher and 

powdered in an agate swing mill. 

Sr isotopic analyses were performed on a VG SECTOR 54 multicollector 

thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) in the Laboratory of Isotope Geology of 

the University of Aveiro, Portugal. Rb and Sr contents were determined by ICP-MS at 

Actlabs Ancaster, Ontario, Canada. The analytical data were corrected for mass 

fractionation using an exponential law (86Sr/88Sr = 0.1194). Average levels of blanks for 

Sr were in the range 0.25-1.0 ng. The standard NBS-987 gave a repeated value of 

0.710254 +/- 34 for (2sd of 49 analyses) during the period of analysis. Regression lines 

have been calculated using the least-squares method of York (1969) as implemented in 

the Isoplot program (Ludwig, 2000). 

For 40Ar/39Ar dating purposes whole rock samples from the Foz da Fonte sill and 

a Monchique lamprophyre were sent to Actlabs Ancaster, Ontario, Canada, where 

amphibole separates were obtained by crushing several kg of sample, sieving, washing 

and separation using magnetic methods and heavy liquids. The separates were wrapped 

in Al foil and loaded in an evacuated and sealed quartz vial with K and Ca salts and flux 

monitors (LP-6 biotite, with and assumed age of 128.1 Ma, Ingamells and Engels, 1976; 

Odin et al., 1982). They were irradiated in the McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, 

nuclear reactor for 48 hours. After the flux monitors were run, J values were calculated, 



 

99 
 

using the measured flux gradient. Neutron gradients did not exceed 0.27% on sample 

size. The Ar isotope composition was measured in a Micromass 5400 static mass 

spectrometer. 1200º C blank of 40Ar did not exceed 2-5*10-10 cc STP. Heating time for 

each step was 10 minutes. After each analysis, the extraction temperature is elevated to 

1800º C for few minutes and the furnace is prepared for next analysis. The reported 

errors correspond to 1?. 

The K-Ar age determination was also performed by Actlabs Ancaster, Ontario, 

Canada on a biotite separate from an ultrabasic lamprophyre obtained after crushing, 

washing and sieving the sample and then using heavy liquids to obtain the mineral 

separate. The determination of the K concentration was obtained by ICP on Thermo 

Jarrell Ash Enviro II ICP Spectrometer after an aliquot of the sample was weighted into 

graphite crucible with lithium metaborate/tetraborate flux and fused using LECO 

induction furnace. For the Ar analysis an aliquot of the sample was weighted into an Al 

container, loaded into the sample collector of  the extraction system, and degassed at ? 

100º C for two days to remove the surface gases. Argon was extracted from the sample 

in a double vacuum furnace at 1700º C. The Ar concentration was then determined 

using isotope dilution with a 38Ar spike, which is introduced to the sample system prior 

to each extraction. The extracted gases are cleaned up in a two step purification system. 

Pure Ar was then introduced into a custom built magnetic sector mass spectrometer 

(Reynolds type) with a Varian CH5 magnet. The ion source has an axial design (Baur-

Signer source), that provides more than 90% transmission and extremely small isotopic 

mass discrimination. Ar isotope ratios measurements were corrected for mass 

discrimination and atmospheric argon was removed assuming that 36Ar is of 

atmospheric origin. The concentration of radiogenic 40Ar was calculated using a 38Ar 

spike. After each analysis the extraction temperature is elevated to 1800º C for few 

minutes and the furnace is prepared for the next analysis. 

Zircon separates for U-Pb analyses were obtained after crushing, washing and 

sieving the rock and then using a standard gravimetric (Wifley and heavy liquids) and 

magnetic (Frantz magnetic separator) separation techniques. Zoning patterns and 

inclusions were investigated by cathodoluminiscence and transmitted light microscopy 

prior to LA-ICP-MS analyses. Analyses were performed in the Geoanalytical 

Laboratory at Washington State University using a New Wave UP213 Nd-YAG (213 

nm) laser ablation system, and a ThermoFinnigan Element2 single collector double 

focusing magnetic sector ICP-MS. The analytical parameters included a repetition rate 



 

100 
 

of 10 Hz, 40 and 30 microns spot sizes, and a total analysis time of 30 sec per spot. See 

Chang et al. (2006) for complete analytical and data reduction procedures. Two zircon 

samples with ages of 564 Ma and 55.5 Ma were used as external standards to correct for 

elemental fractionation, and mass bias. Accuracy, based on age determinations for 

standards, is generally 2-3% or better. 

 

5.2.1 Foz da Fonte sill 

The 40Ar/39Ar isotopic analyses for amphibole separates from the Foz da Fonte 

sill give a plateau age of 93.6 Ma ± 2.3 Ma, corresponding to 98% of released 39Ar (fig. 

5.1). The reverse isochron diagram results in an age of 93.8 ± 3.9 Ma, MSWD = 0.47 

and (40Ar/36Ar)0 = 293 ± 11 (fig. 5.2). The plateau age appears to correspond to the 

closing of the amphibole and provides a good estimate for the rock crystallization age, 

which corresponds to the oldest known age obtained for the entire alkaline magmatism 

of the onshore WIM.

5.2.2 Sintra granite  

The Sintra subvolcanic complex has been the target of several age 

determinations. According to the published data, the emplacement of the granite (81.9 ± 

0.4 Ma, K-Ar in biotite, MacIntyre &amp;amp; Berger, 1982; 84.0 ± 1.1, K-Ar in K-feldspar, 

Storetvedt et al., 1987) occurred before the intrusion of the gabbro and syenite magmas 

(76.1 ± 1.1 to  78.3 ± 1.9 Ma, K-Ar in whole rock syenite, Storetvedt et al., 1987; 74.9 ± 

1.0 Ma whole-rock K-Ar in gabbro, Storetvedt et al., 1987). 

In order to obtain a reliable crystallization age for the Sintra granite laccolith and 

to assess whether the emplacement of this magma occurred before or after the intrusion 

of the other units of the complex, a zircon separate from the granite was dated with the 

U-Pb method, using LA-ICP-MS. The results are shown in fig. 5.3 and table 3. 

 

 
Fig. 5.3: U-Pb Tera-Wasserburg plot for the analysed zircons from the Sintra granite. Error ellipses 2? 

error. Ages at 95% confidence level.  

 

The 79.2 ± 0.8 Ma age obtained for the zircons from the Sintra granite (fig. 5.3), 

although younger than most of the previously published ages (table 5.1), is still older 

than the central values for the known ages for the gabbro and syenite (although within 

the error limits o some of these) and close to the K-Ar age determined in biotite 

separates from that same granite (table 5.1). This is compatible with: (i) field 

observations that show that the gabbroic and syenitic rocks define intrusive 



 

103 
 

relationships with the granite and (ii) recently obtained gravity data showing that in this 

composite massif vertical gabbro plugs intrude an older granite laccolith (Terrinha et al., 

2003). Also, the known K-Ar ages for the syenite and gabbro suite can be subject to  

previously mentioned problems, such as excess Ar, which may exaggerate their age, as 

it appears to be the case with the 84 ± 1.1 age obtained in a K-feldspar separate 

(Storetvedt et al., 1987) from the Sintra granite. 

  
5.2.3 Sines syenite 

The Sines complex was also previously dated, using the K-Ar and Rb-Sr 

methods. The wide range of "ages" displayed by these rocks (78.9 ± 1.5 to 62.0 ± 1.3 

Ma K-Ar in whole rock diabase dykes; 75.2 ± 0.8 to 63.8 ± 0.8 Ma K-Ar age in K-

feldspar from the syenite; 72.0 ± 1.5 Rb-Sr whole rock isochron, Canilho and 

Abranches, 1982), particularly the values below 70 Ma are probably the result of a late 

thermal overprint that may have caused argon loss (Storetvedt et al., 1987). 

With the aim of constraining the age of installation for this subvolcanic complex, 

a zircon separate from the syenite facies was dated using U-Pb geochronology by LA-

ICP-MS. The obtained results are plotted in Figure 6 and table 3.

The 75.4 ± 0.6 Ma U-Pb age acquired for the zircons from the Sines syenites (fig. 6) is 

concordant, within analytical error, with the oldest previously obtained K-Ar age on K-

feldspar separates (Storetvedt et al., 1987) but older than the whole rock Rb-Sr isochron 

(Canilho and Abranches, 1982) and the ages obtained by the K-Ar method on diabase 



 

105 
 

dykes and other feldspar separates (table 5.1), which may be an indicator of significant 

Ar loss since cooling. 

 

 5.2.4 Monchique  

The Monchique plutonic complex has been previously dated using both the K-Ar 

and the Rb-Sr methods. The obtained ages cluster around 72 Ma (Rock, 1976, 

MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997). 

Recent revision of the geological mapping of this complex allowed the 

identification of two concentric units of different nepheline syenites, the inner of which 

encloses various bodies of basic and ultra-basic rocks (Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, 

2003). We dated some of the nepheline syenites and ultrabasics identified by these 

authors with the aim of clarifying some intriguing ages obtained previously that may be 

related to the previously identified problem with Ar loss and its effect on some of the K-

Ar ages obtained even in feldspar and nepheline separates (MacIntyre and Berger, 

1982). 

Representative samples from the different magmatic units of the Monchique 

massif were selected for Rb-Sr whole-rock dating. The Rb-Sr isotope data together with 

the Rb and Sr concentrations are given in table 5.4. 

 
Table 5.4: Rb and Sr isotopic data for the Monchique rocks. Rb and Sr concentrations obtain by ICP-MS, 

estimated error for the values of 2%. Sample location can be found in Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, 

2003.

As shown in figure 5.5a, the five nepheline syenite samples are roughly co-linear 

on the 87Sr/86Sr vs. 87Rb/86Sr diagram yielding a model 1 type Isoplot® Rb-Sr whole-

rock isochron of 72.3 ± 4.2 Ma (MSWD = 0.98; 87Sr/86Sri = 0.703258 ± 0.000049). Due 

to the low MSWD, the 72.3 ± 4.2 Ma age appears to reflect the real intrusion age of the 

nepheline syenite magma.

A similar age was obtained by adding two samples from the mafic intrusives 

(71.8 ± 5.8 Ma, initial 87Sr/86Sri = 0.703244 ± 0.000073 and MSWD = 3.5, fig. 5.5b) 

suggesting a coeval emplacement and a genetic link between all units. The reported ages 

are concordant, within analytical error, with the 72 ± 2 Ma and 72 ± 1.5 Rb-Sr whole-

rock isochrons determined by Rock (1976) and Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997), 

respectively.

Monchique complex defines a weighed mean plateau age of 74.4 ± 2.0 Ma,

corresponding to 87 % of released 39Ar (table 5.5, fig. 5.6). On the reverse isochron 

plot, the plateau points define a linear trend with an age of 72.7 ± 2.7 Ma, MSWD = 

0.16  (fig. 5.7) and an initial 40Ar/36Ar of 410 ± 103, which is higher than the 

atmospheric value and suggests presence of excess Ar. The total fusion age (75.6 ± 1.3 

Ma) shows a good agreement with the plateau age (74.4 ± 2.0 Ma) but the presence of 

excess Ar suggests that the reverse isochron should reflect the crystalization age for 

these amphiboles. 

The general concordance between the results of 40Ar/39Ar amphibole dating for 

the ultrabasic lamprohyres and the Rb-Sr whole-rock age of the nepheline syenites 

appear to indicate that the different units of the Monchique massif may have been 

intruded within a short time interval, centered around 72-73 Ma. This is also consistent 

with the geochronological data obtained in previous studies. 

 

5.2.5 Loulé 

The Loulé lamprophyre dykes belong to a small group of alkaline intrusives 

exposed in the Algarve basin, showing strong petrographical and chemical similarities 

with their equivalents in the nearby Monchique complex (Martins, 1991). 

A biotite separate from the Loulé lamprophyre dyke was selected for K-Ar 

isotopic analysis. The results are summarized in table 5.6. The biotite K-Ar age (71.8 ± 

1.9 Ma) is concordant, within analytical error, with the 40Ar/39Ar age obtained for the 

Monchique lamprophyre (74.4 ± 2.0 Ma). This suggests that the K-Ar system was not 

disturbed by subsequent thermal episodes and that the age of the biotite separates from 

this sample still dates the time of crystallization. From the obtained data, it is also 

possible to conclude that the lamprophyres intruding both the Monchique complex and 

the Algarve basin are coeval.

5.3 Summary and discussion 

The new age determinations, combined with previously published data, allow us 

to constrain the duration of the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle to circa 22 Ma and to 

define two distinct pulses of alkaline magmatic activity. The first one (94-88Ma) 

occurred during the opening of the Bay of Biscay and consequent rotation of Iberia 

(123-80 Ma; Sibuet et al., 2004) and clusters around the Lisbon area (approximately 

N38º 20' and N39º) where it occurs mainly as sills (Foz da Fonte and Paço d’Ilhas). The 

second pulse lasted from 75 Ma to 72 Ma corresponds to a more widespread event with 

scattered occurrences from the Algarve Basin in southernmost Portugal (37ºN) to the 

Lisbon area (N39º) and comprises both intrusive and extrusive complexes. This final 

pulse is synchronous with the first pulses of tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic basins 

due to the onset of rapid convergence between the African and Iberian plates (e.g. 

Mougenot, 1980, Terrinha, 1998, Rosembaum et al., 2002). The Sintra granite laccolith 

has an age of ca. 79 Ma and was emplaced between these two pulses of magmatism. 

It should be noted that until the publishing of the new geochronological data by 

Miranda et al. (2009), only a single alkaline episode was known in the WIM. However, 

considering the reduced number of known occurrences with ages compatible with the 

first pulse, it is possible that the acquisition of further geochronological data might 

result in the recognition of a continuing age spectra between the two proposed pulses. 

Radiometric dating of the Sintra granite gives an 79.2 ± 0.8 Ma age, which 

although equivalent within error to the oldest age obtained for the syenite (78.3 ± 1.9 

Ma, whole rock K-Ar, Storetvedt et al., 1987) its still older than the other K-Ar ages 

obtained for these rocks (76.4 ± 1.4 and 76.1 ± 1.1 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987). This, 

combined with the observed field cross-cutting relations and geophysical data 

(gravimetry and AMS, Terrinha et al., 2003), allows us to hypothesize that the granite 

corresponds to an older phase that is intruded by a more recent gabbro to syenite suite. 

As shown by geochronological and isotopic data, all the members of the 

Monchique alkaline suite are co-magmatic and appear to have been emplaced in a short 

interval of time, within the analytical error of the used geochronological methods. 

The similar ages obtained for the lower volume of alkaline magmatism intruding 

the opposite rifted and thinned margins of the Iberian plate (105-69 Ma in the Pyrenees 

and Catalan ranges, Fabriès et al., 1998; Montigny et al., 1986, Solé et al., 2003) 

suggest a relationship between the Late Cretaceous magmatism and the changes in plate 



 

110 
 

kinematics and seafloor spreading geometry contemporaneous with the opening of the 

Bay of Biscay.

111 
 

A recent study by Grange et al. (2010) dated the Paço d’Ilhas sill and the Sintra, 

Sines and Monchique igneous complexes. These authors argue that there is a clear age 

progression from north to south in the alkaline rocks present in the onshore WIM. They 

correspond to 88.3 ± 0.5 Ma for Paço d’Ilhas sill, while in Sintra the obtained ages were 

of 83.4 ± 0.7 for the Sintra diorite, 82.0 ±0.7 and 81.7 ± 0.4 for the Sintra granite, and 

80.1 ± 1.0 Ma for the Sintra syenite. The Sines complex yielded ages of 77.2 ± 0.6 and 

77.2 ± 0.4 for the diorite and of 76.1 ±1.3 Ma for the syenite. In Monchique the 

obtained ages were of 70.0 ± 2.9 for the gabbro and 68.8±1.0 Ma for the Monchique 

nepheline syenite (Grange et al., 2010). 

Some of the ages obtained by these authors agree within error with the ones 

presented in this study (Sines syenite and Monchique gabbro), while the Sintra granite 

seems to show older ages by ? 2 Ma. These aut hors also report the oldest yet ages 

obtained for basic rocks and syenites in Sintra as well as for the Sines intrusive basic 

rocks. On the other hand, the age obtained for the Monchique nepheline syenites is 

equivalent to the youngest ages obtained by the K-Ar method and attributed to Ar loss 

(e.g. MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; Storetvedt et al., 1990). 

The presence of zircon fractions that yield younger ages (74.8 to 81.3 Ma, 

Grange et al., 2010) in the Sintra diorite and older ages in the Sintra syenite (up to 142 

Ma, Grange et al., 2010), Sines diorite (up to 132 Ma, Grange et al., 2010) and of six 

titanite fractions in the Monchique syenite that yield an average age of 70.0 ± 2.9 Ma 

complicate the interpretation of the results.  

Another factor that can contribute for the slightly different age values obtained 

by these authors could be related with slight difference between the initial Pb isotope 

composition of the zircon (and titanite) and the feldspar. As the zircon (and titanite) 

ages have been corrected with the initial Pb measured in the feldspar, a difference 

between the initial Pb present in the feldspars and in the zircons could result in minor 

discordance in the obtained ages (Grange et al., 2010).

6. Petrography and mineral chemistry 
 

6.1. Petrography 

 
This section includes a summarized petrographic characterization of the sampled 

rocks within each major occurrence and of the xenoliths that are contained in some of 

them. A detailed petrographic description is beyond the scope of this study, given the 

complete petrographic works developed by previous authors which are referenced 

below. 

All of the major mineral phases are identified, along with the observed textural 

features. These textures are interpreted in order to extract the highest possible amount of 

information on the formation conditions of these rocks and xenoliths as well as the 

mineral phases that they contain. 

 

6.1.1. The Lisbon Volcanic Complex 

 The petrography of the LVC has been covered in detail by Palácios (1985) and 

references cited therein, so only an abridged petrographic description of the main 

lithotypes will be given below. 

 

- The lava flows: 

The lava flows are mostly constituted by porphyritic alkaline basalts (s.l.) and 

basanites, containing abundant olivine, clinopyroxene, sometimes titanomagnetite and 

more rarely plagioclase phenocrysts in a very fine grained matrix constituted by 

plagioclase, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides, more infrequently olivine and in some 

very rare cases even biotite. Brown amphibole (kaersutite) phenocrysts are also present 

in some flows (e.g. Negrais) but are seldom observed. 

Olivine phenocrysts (Fo85-68) can be euhedral, subhedral and sometimes rounded 

and have inclusions of opaque oxides. They are often the only altered mineral observed 

in the rock and show substitution by either chlorite or serpentine. In the basal flows that 



 

113 
 

outcrop in the Ribeira de Fanhões and Ramada areas olivine is the only phenocrystic 

phase present. 

The clinopyroxene phenocrysts vary in size from 0.5 to over 2 millimeters, are 

euhedral and often zoned, showing a stronger pink to purple color in the rims and a 

more pale shade of the same color in the core, which indicates an increase in Ti contents 

(0.8-5.5 % TiO2) with progressing crystallization. Sometimes these phenocrysts are 

subhedral and show embayments filled with matrix material. They can also show patchy 

zoning or, more rarely, they can show oscillatory zoning as well. Inclusions of Fe-Ti 

oxides and olivine are common.  

The Ti-Fe oxides are euhedral to subhedral and often have a bimodal 

distribution, with the flows containing two generations of oxides with different sizes 

(phenocrysts and microphenocrysts).  

Plagioclase phenocrysts are very rare and occur in only three slightly more 

evolved samples (MgO &amp;lt;8%) such as the Lexim and Besueira vents and the Negrais 

flow. 

The rare kaersutite phenocrysts are surrounded by a reaction rim where 

amphibole breaks down to clinopyroxene, plagioclase and opaque minerals. In some 

cases, a pink clinopyroxene rim is observed around this reaction rim. Clinopyroxenes 

with clear rims, but whose core is dotted with oxide and plagioclase inclusions are 

relatively common within the basalts and may correspond to completely retrograded 

amphiboles where the previously mentioned reaction was completed. 

The crystals in the matrix usually show an elongated shape, except for the Fe-Ti 

oxides, and a preferred orientation, most likely due to crystallization during flow. The 

matrix is mostly fresh, except for olivine that might be completely altered to chlorite or 

serpentine. 

 

- The necks: 

The necks that acted as conduits for the LVC’s lavas are also basalts and 

basanites which are frequently texturally zoned, with the areas near the contact with the 

country rock being aphanitic to weakly porphyritic, showing only olivine phenocrysts 

and very fine grained matrixes. The interior of the necks, however, is usually very 

porphyritic and shows a coarser, sometimes almost granular, matrix. 



 

114 
 

Vesicles with secondary carbonate or zeolite fillings are rare but amigdulaes 

with radial inward growth of clinopyroxene and plagioclase were observed. 

Otherwise, the necks are quite similar to the flows in terms of mineralogy, with 

olivine and clinopyroxene being the main phenocrystic phases, along with some minor 

Fe-Ti oxides. The matrix is generally made of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides 

and olivine, with the latter being altered to serpentine at times. 

The clinopyroxene phenocrysts present in the center of the necks can have 

olivine and Fe-Ti oxides inclusions both in the core and rims. The Fe-Ti oxide 

inclusions can either be numerous and concentrate in the core area, or be located near 

the rims but absent in the core. The rims of these phenocrysts usually show a darker 

shade of pink-purple. Concentric zoning is rare but was also observed. 

Olivine phenocrysts can be either rounded or subhedral to euhedral, and 

occasionally more than one of these habits can be observed in the same thin section. 

Alteration to serpentine is common along the rims and fractures of the olivines present 

in the more altered samples. 

The Ti-Fe oxides are usually euhedral. 

The matrix is constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and 

olivine. It varies from very fine grained to fine grained from the contact to the center of 

the vent, and its crystals are mostly fresh except for olivine in that might be completely 

altered to chlorite or serpentine. 

 

- The plugs: 

From the total of 3 small, semi circular basaltic (s.l.) plugs that outcrop in the 

Ribeira d’Ilhas beach, only the two largest ones (central and southern) were sampled.  

The southern plug (RM 36) is made out of a very porphyritic rock, with 

clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and pseudomorphs of olivine phenocrysts in a fine grained 

matrix constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene, brown amphibole, Fe-Ti oxides. 

Brown amphibole megacrysts and xenoliths made out of brown amphibole, Fe-Ti 

oxides, apatite and clinopyroxene are common. One titanite megacryst with a reaction 

rim of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxene was also observed. 

The clinopyroxene phenocrysts can be divided in two groups. The first one is 

made out of clinopyroxene crystals similar to the ones identified in the alkaline basalts, 

with pink phenocrysts showing darker rims and common Fe-Ti oxide inclusions. A 



 

115 
 

second type of clinopyroxene phenocryst was also identified, being characterized by an 

irregularly shaped green core, a colorless to light pink mantle and darker pink rim. 

The olivine phenocrysts (Fo86-77) are almost completely pseudomorphosed by 

serpentine and carbonate. 

The matrix is fine grained and is constituted mostly by plagioclase, pink 

clinopyroxene, brown amphibole and Fe-Ti oxides. It shows some vesicles filled by 

carbonate.  

The amphibole xenocrysts invariably show numerous small oxide and sulphide 

inclusions, as well as reaction rim that is distinguished from the one shown by 

amphiboles in the lava flows since it is constituted solely by clinopyroxene and opaque 

Fe-Ti oxides, with plagioclase being absent. 

The central and largest plug is quite similar to its southern counterpart, with the 

difference that a central, vesicular and more altered facies can be observed. Also, brown 

amphibole is absent in the matrix of the central plug, and the olivine phenocrysts are 

mostly unaltered in the fresher outer facies (RM 37). Otherwise it is also a very 

porphyritic rock with phenocrysts of olivine, Fe-Ti oxides and the same two kinds of 

clinopyroxene in a matrix constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides. 

 

- The Oeiras-Cascais dykes: 

Most of the dykes associated with the LVC are extremely altered, to the point in 

which their original mineralogy is no longer identifiable, making their classification 

exceedingly difficult.  

The only fresh basic alkaline dykes available for sampling are located in the 

coastline within the vicinities of Oeiras and Cascais. Although the exact age of these 

dykes remains unknown, geochemical affinities and the proximity of LVC’s flows 

indicate that these were likely feeders for the subaerial magmatism (Miranda et al., 

2005). 

The dykes can be separated in two main categories. Some are porphyritic 

basalts, and the others more evolved and lighter colored hawaiite-like rocks. 

The basalts are usually very porphyritic, with abundant olivine and in some 

cases clinopyroxene phenocrysts in a fine grained matrix constituted by plagioclase, 

clinopyroxene, serpentinized olivine and Fe-Ti oxides. The olivine is commonly altered 

to serpentine or carbonate. Carbonates also fill all of the vesicles and fractures and can 

even substitute clinopyroxene in more altered rocks.

117 
 

The hawaiites are usually more vesicular, have coarser but still fine grained 

textures, and their phenocrystic phases can be brown amphibole, clinopyroxene and 

plagioclase. The matrix is fine grained and constituted by plagioclase, clinopyroxene, 

and Fe-Ti oxides, with brown amphibole being present in some cases where olivine is 

not found.  

Amygdulae with larger plagioclase and amphibole crystals are common in these 

rocks. Vesicules and fractures are commonly filled with secondary carbonate. 

 

- The sills: 

Numerous sills are integrated into the LVC. All of them were described by 

Palácios (1985), with the ones present in the Anços-Montelevar region being the subject 

of a specific study by Matos Alves et al. (1972). 

The Lomba dos Pianos sill has a porphyritic texture with clinopyroxene, 

plagioclase and rare olivine phenocrysts occurring in a fine grained matrix with 

plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and accessory  feldspar, biotite, apatite, titanite 

and analcime. This matrix can show significant chloritic alteration. Amphibole 

megacrysts with reaction rims of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and oxides are found in this 

sill, but are rare. This rock has lamprophyric affinities and has been previously 

classified as a teschenite (Mahmoudi, 1991). 

The olivine phenocrysts are in the majority of cases completely altered to pale 

green mineral that might correspond to chlorite.  

As in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug, there are two types of clinopyroxene phenocrysts 

present, the clinopyroxene crystals with pink cores with darker rims and a second type 

of clinopyroxene phenocryst with irregularly shaped green cores, colorless to light pink 

mantles and darker pink rims. 

Plagioclase phenocrysts can be euhedral or have rounded edges. They often 

show concentric zoning or rims with optical characteristics that are different from their 

cores. Their cores are frequently subject of some sericitic alteration while the rims can 

remain unaltered. 

Also present are clinopyroxenes dotted with numerous oxide and plagioclase 

inclusions that may correspond to completely retrograded amphiboles. 



 

118 
 

In certain parts of the sill it is possible to observe small layers with a coarser 

adcumulate texture. They are constituted mostly by plagioclase with euhedral cores and 

large cloudy rims with interstitial clinopyroxene, feldspar, and Fe-Ti oxides and quartz.  

 

The Montelavar sill displays a bimodal texture with porphyrocrystals of feldspar 

and plagioclase and grey to colorless clinopyroxene that are inserted in a medium 

grained matrix of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and interstitial feldspar, 

apatite and rare quartz. This sill could be classified as a monzodiorite. 

The plagioclase megacrysts (An64-14) are often zoned and can display some 

sericitic alteration. Chlorite and other philosilicates, along with some rare carbonate, are 

the main alteration phases seen in the matrix. 

 

The Anços sill has a porphyroid texture with plagioclase, feldspar, and colorless 

clinopyroxene porphyrocristals in a fine grained matrix composed of plagioclase, 

clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and accessory titanite and apatite and sometimes even 

quartz. The matrix and feldspar phenocrysts show some alteration to phyllossilicates 

and carbonate. Similarly to the Montelevar sill, this intrusion could be classified as a 

monzodiorite. 

 

The Eiras do Faião sill shows a bimodal granular texture, with larger green 

clinopyroxene, titanite, Fe-Ti oxides and rare brown amphibole crystals in a fine grained 

matrix of mostly plagioclase, colorless clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides with accessory 

apatite, biotite, titanite, zeolites and analcime. Given its relative abundance in foids, this 

rock can be classified as a foid monzodiorite. 

This sill is formed by a very vesicular rock with most of these being filled by 

fibrous zeolite.  

One of the samples collected in this sill contained a medium grained xenolith 

made out of mostly brown amphibole and greenish clinopyroxene with accessory Fe-Ti 

oxides and apatite. 

 

The Alqueidão sill has a medium grained texture, with mostly plagioclase, Fe-Ti 

oxides, clinopyroxene and interstitial feldspar. It is very altered, with most of the mafics 



 

119 
 

being replaced by fibrous looking minerals, probably phyllossilicates, while the 

dominating plagioclase remained relatively fresh. In some of the more altered samples, 

even plagioclase could show important chloritic and sericitic alteration. Like other sills 

in the region, this intrusion could be classified as a monzodiorite. 

 

6.1.2. Malveira da Serra sill 

 
This sill is constituted by a mafic, very porphyritic rock with phenocrysts of 

brown amphibole, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and olivine pseudomorphosed by 

chlorite in a very fine matrix of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, brown amphibole, Fe-Ti 

oxides, biotite, apatite and olivine pseudomorphosed by chlorite. According to its 

texture and mineralogy, this sill can be classified as a camptonite (Rock, 1986).  

Vesicles are rare but are usually filled with carbonate.  

Similarly to the Lomba dos Pianos sill and the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug, we can 

observe two types of clinopyroxene phenocrysts, namely clinopyroxene crystals with 

pink phenocrysts with darker rims and also green cored clinopyroxenes with irregularly 

shaped green cores, surrounded by a colorless to light pink mantle and darker pink rim. 

The brown amphibole phenocrysts can also be divided in two groups, one with 

abundant small oxide inclusions in the darker cores, which are enveloped by a lighter 

brown mantle and a darker rim. This group also commonly shows clinopyroxene and 

olivine inclusions, which may themselves contain oxide inclusions. The second type of 

observed brown amphibole has a lighter brown core and a darker brown rim and less 

abundant inclusions. 

Some of the Fe-Ti oxide phenocrysts have distinctive irregularly shaped rims, 

resembling small appendixes.  

 
6.1.3. Mafra plug  

 
The Mafra plug is a gabbroic rock with a bimodal granular poikilitic texture, 

with the larger brown amphibole and clinopyroxenes involving plagioclase (An78-33), 

olivine, biotite, Fe-Ti oxides and rarer nepheline and apatite. Given the presence of 

nepheline, this rock classifies as a foid gabbro. 



 

120 
 

The clinopyroxenes are commonly zoned, with darker purple rims, as a 

consequence of enrichment in Ti (TiO2 1.2-3.8%) or can even show oscillatory zoning. 

Olivine (Fo86-85) is often altered to chlorite. Amphibole seems to be a later phase, as it 

envelops both these minerals. 

All these are inserted in a fine grained matrix of plagioclase, smaller 

clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, nepheline, apatite and biotite. 

 

6.1.4. Foz da Fonte sill 

 
This tephritic sill has a fine grained texture with plagioclase, brown amphibole, 

clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, and accessory apatite and feldspathoids. Inclusions of 

oxides are common in amphiboles and plagioclase.  

Secondary carbonate can be observed, filling vesicles and fractures. 

 

6.1.5. Paço d’Ilhas sill 

 
The Paço d’Ilhas sill is a layered intrusion, displaying two different lithotypes 

with different mineralogies and textures. Its petrographic features are discussed in detail 

by Mahmoudi (1991). 

The mafic layers have a monzogabbroic composition and display a medium 

grained texture with dominating plagioclase (An72-20) and lesser biotite, clinopyroxene, 

Fe-Ti oxides and intersticial feldspsar. Often the plagioclases show a more irregular, 

probably Na-rich rim, as a likely result of growth from an intercumulus liquid. The 

plagioclases might show larger crystals than the remaining minerals that constitute the 

rock. 

The felsic monzosyenite layers have a similar texture, only with more abundant 

plagioclase (&gt; 75%) and less abundant, smaller, mafic minerals. 

Both the varieties are considerably altered, with the clinopyroxenes being almost 

completely replaced by alteration products and carbonate substituting both plagioclase 

and mafic minerals as well as occupying interstices. Also, the plagioclases commonly 

show alteration to phyllossilicates.

122 
 

6.1.6. The Sintra mafic rocks 

 
The two gabbros sampled in the Sintra complex show extremely varied textures. 

These and the other lithologies present in this complex have been extensively described 

by Matos Alves (1964), Wright (1969), Sparks and Wadge (1976) and Leal (1990). 

The Peninha gabbro has medium grained to coarser, poikilitic textures and is 

constituted mostly by plagioclase (An72-20), clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, interstitial 

feldspar  and  apatite,  as well as by brown amphibole  that envelops  all of the  previous 

phases. The brown amphibole can in addition show biotite growing on its rims or partial 

replacement by secondary, fibrous, green amphibole. 

Besides green amphibole, the other secondary alteration phases present are 

epidote, feldspar, chlorite, rare carbonate and even more rarely, tourmaline. These 

minerals can be either concentrated in late veins or dispersed in more plagioclase-rich 

areas. Plagioclase and feldspar can also display some sericitic alteration.  

Locally the amphibole can form aggregates that give the rock a glomoporphyric 

texture that is characteristic of many of its outcrops (see fig. 4.9). 

The gabbros in the Azóia outcrop show a coarse grained poikilitic and even 

glomorporphyric texture, with brown amphibole envolving clinopyroxene, plagioclase, 

Fe-Ti oxides and apatite. Accessory minerals include biotite, which can be observed 

growing in the rims of amphibole crystals, as well as some interstitial feldspar and a 

mineral completely pseudomorphosed by alteration products, possibly olivine. 

These gabbroic rocks are substantially more altered than those at Peninha, often 

showing a greener color due to a higher degree of transformation of brown amphibole 

into fibrous green amphibole, chlorite substituting clinopyroxenes and plagioclase, and 

to the existence of veins of feldspar, epidote and carbonate that substitute the original 

mineralogy. The alteration seems to affect the plagioclase and feldspars more than it 

affects the other minerals. 

The diorite, sampled in the Malveira da Serra-Azóia outcrop, is similar to these 

more altered gabbros, except it has more abundant plagioclase and biotite and less 

clinopyroxene, brown amphibole and Fe-Ti oxides. Otherwise it shows similar textural 

features, with the amphiboles enveloping clinopyroxene, apatite and opaque minerals 

and analogous secondary alteration phases, except in this case the green amphibole is 



 

123 
 

much more common and often completely substitutes the rims of clinopyroxene and 

amphibole. 

 
6.1.7. The Sines mafic rocks 

 

The Sines igneous complex has two gabbro outcrops with distinct textural and 

mineralogical features (see 4.1.7). These outcrops, as well as the remaining lithologies 

present in the complex are described in detail by Canilho (1972). 

The gabbros that outcrop at Praia Vasco da Gama are similar to the ones 

observed in Sintra and show a very coarse, granular poikilitic texture with very large 

crystals of brown amphibole enveloping plagioclase, apatite, Fe-Ti oxides and rare 

clinopyroxene. The amphibole can be surrounded by biotite in some areas. Interstitial 

feldspar and biotite are also observed.Secondary alteration minerals include chlorite and 

rarer epidote. 

The Pedras Negras gabbro shows macroscopic layering, smaller grain size and a 

different mineralogy. These rocks have an orthocumulate texture where clinopyroxene 

and olivine (Fo70-67) megacrysts are surrounded by a finer matrix of plagioclase (An82-

48), Fe-Ti oxides and some clinopyroxene and olivine, as well as rare apatite and biotite. 

The megacrysts can sometimes be enveloped by later brown amphibole. 

Alteration is present, although it is less important than in the amphibole rich 

gabbros. It is characterized by the alteration of olivine to serpentine and oxides, and of 

plagioclase to phyllossilicates and chlorite. In more altered zones, green amphibole and 

phyllossilicates may be present. 

The diorite was sampled near the gabbro outcrop of Praia Vasco da Gama and 

corresponds to a medium grained rock constituted by abundant plagioclase, colorless to 

brown clinopyroxene, biotite, brown amphibole, Fe-Ti oxides and accessory amounts of 

apatite and titanite. The most important alteration mineral is chlorite that affects mostly 

plagioclase, clinopyroxene and biotite. 

The cumulate and more basic nature of the Pedras Negras gabbro in Sines 

may indicate that this outcrop is representative of a deeper level in the magma 

chamber when compared to its southern counterpart that outcrops in Praia Vasco da 

Gama. As the amphibole rich Praia Vasco da Gama gabbro also shows a much 



 

124 
 

coarser texture, it could represent a higher, more evolved and hydrated part of the 

same magma chamber that cooled later than the deeper Pedras Negras gabbro.  

The different gabbroic outcrops are separated by one E-W trending fault, whose 

movement might have caused uplift of the northern block causing the deeper level of the 

magma chamber, represented by the olivine rich Pedras Negras gabbro, to be exposed. 
 

6.1.8. The Monchique mafic and ultramafic rocks 

 
The samples used in this study were previously described and classified by 

Valadares (2004), and include essexites, sieno-diorites and also ijolites and 

lamprophyres. 

The ijolite has a poikilitic texture where nepheline and plagioclase involve 

purple to pink clinopyroxene, greenish clinopyroxene, biotite, Fe-Ti oxides, titanite, 

and apatite. In the lamprophyre, larger brown amphibole, clinopyroxene and olivine 

crystals are observed in a finer matrix of clinopyroxene, nepheline, feldspar, Fe-Ti 

oxides, biotite and apatite. The clinopyroxenes and amphiboles seem to have 

continued growing until the latest crystallization stages since they can involve 

poikilitically the matrix crystals. 

The remaining rocks are mostly theralites (nepheline gabbros) constituted by 

clinopyroxene, plagioclase, more or less abundant brown amphibole, feldspar, 

biotite, nepheline, Fe-Ti oxides and apatite, with textures varying from coarsely 

granular, to poikilitical and to bimodal. 

 The sieno-diorites show the same mineralogy, but are richer in plagioclase, 

feldspar and nepheline than the theralites.  

These rocks are mostly fresh but some minor alteration is observed, with the 

main alteration phases present being sericite, carbonate and actinolite. 

 
6.1.9. The Loulé dykes 

 
Although these dykes were both sampled in the same location (the Loulé salt 

mine) and quite close to each other, they are texturally and mineralogically distinct. 



 

125 
 

Dyke C-20 is a very porphyritic rock, showing phenocrysts of clinopyroxene and 

phlogopite in a fine grained matrix of plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxides, clinopyroxene, 

nepheline and rare carbonate. This carbonate might be primary since this rock is not in 

contact with carbonated country rocks on the sampling location. Given its texture and 

mineralogy, this dyke can be classified as a monchiquite lamprophyre (Rock, 1986). 

The clinopyroxene phenocrysts show, as in other rocks described in this section, 

two types of cores. There are clinopyroxene phenocrysts that are light pink to colorless 

in the cores and with darker rims, as well as green cored clinopyroxenes with irregularly 

shaped green cores, surrounded by a colorless to light pink mantle and darker pink rim. 

The biotite phenocrysts often show inclusions of Fe-Ti oxides and/or apatite and 

can partially involve clinopyroxene crystals. 

In its turn, dyke C-12-1  seems more basaltic as it shows phenocrysts of rounded 

olivine completely substituted by serpentine, plus some rarer clinopyroxene in a fine 

grained matrix of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxides, apatite and minor biotite. 

Although the olivine phenocrysts are completely altered, the remaining rock seems 

quite fresh.  

 

6.1.10. The Fontanelas seamount 

 
All of the samples from igneous rocks dredged from the Fontanelas seamount 

corresponded to pillow lavas and hyaloclastites and show important signs of alteration, 

including calcite filled vesicles and an overall brown to greenish color. 

In thin section these rocks are very vesicular (they can have over 40% vesicles), 

have an aphanitic to porphyritic texture, with a deeply altered groundmass. 

The porphyritic rocks show phenocrysts of extremely altered olivine, but 

unaltered clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and sometimes even amphibole.  

The clinopyroxene phenocrysts present are of the green cored and normal (pink 

to purple) varieties already observed and described in outcrops of the same basic 

alkaline nature on land. 

Alteration in the groundmass is pervasive, but still, the clinopyroxenes and 

oxides are always identifiable matrix phases, with plagioclase being present only in the 



 

126 
 

fresher samples where it has not been substituted by secondary alteration phases, such 

as clays or carbonate.  

The vesicles are commonly partially or completely filled with carbonate, clays 

and even Fe-Mn oxides. 

One sample shows a single xenolith that is constituted by one very large brown 

amphibole with clinopyroxene, biotite, titanite and apatite inclusions. 

 

6.1.11 Xenoliths and megacrysts 

 
Although xenoliths are quite rare in these rocks, they can be found in reasonable 

amounts at the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug, in the Eiras do Faião sill and more rarely in the 

Fontanelas seamount. Most of them are of igneous origin and show shapes that vary 

between sub-angular and rounded in cross section.  

Sedimentary xenoliths of limestone with significant siliciclastic component were 

also identified in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug, but are very rare. 

In addition to the xenoliths, megacrysts of amphibole and clinopyroxene can 

also be found in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug and Lomba dos Pianos sill.  

The amphiboles invariably show a rim of pink clinopyroxene and very small 

oxides. This rim distinguishes these amphibole megacrysts from the ones described in 

the in the Negrais flow which show a reaction rim of clinopyroxene + plagioclase + 

oxides. 

The igneous xenoliths are consistently olivine free and typically constituted 

mainly by brown amphibole and clinopyroxene, that may have green or colorless cores, 

with accessory apatite, Fe-Ti oxides, and in the case of the Eiras do Faião sill and 

Fontanelas lavas, minor titanite, with the second additionally having biotite. They can 

be therefore classified as hornblendites or (hornblende bearing) clinopyroxenites, 

depending if either hornblende or clinopyroxene are modally dominant, respectively. 

Grain size among the crystals contained in the xenoliths is is usually constant 

within single xenoliths, but is heterogenous between different xenoliths, and can 

varying between 0.2 and more than 1 mm.  

Plagioclase is very rare, with only one small xenolith containing this mineral, 

along with green cored clinopyroxene and apatite. 



 

127 
 

Most of the xenoliths show signs of reaction with the magma where they are 

inserted, resulting in the formation of a rim of clinopyroxene and oxides that encloses 

them. 

The xenolith in the Eiras do Faião sill (fig. 6.1G) and some in the Ribeira d’Ilhas 

plug have a granular, fine to medium grained texture that shows hints of 

recrystalyzation, since all the grains have sutured boundaries, are approximately 

equidimensional, and often show amphibole growing in clinopyroxene junctions.  

The clinopyroxenes in these xenoliths can show a sieved texture with blebs of 

brown amphibole growing inside it. Sieve textures can be interpreted as resulting from 

corrosion of minerals in a magma with which they are not in equilibrium, or as a 

consequence of incipient partial melting. In some cases, clinopyroxenes can also display 

oxide exsolution lamelae along cleavage planes. 

In some of the coarser grained xenoliths and in most of the xenocrysts, the 

amphiboles are dotted with small oxide and sulphide inclusions, giving them a darker, 

unclear aspect.  

Gabbroic to dioritic and syenitic xenoliths containing plagioclase and K feldspar 

were also reported by Palácios (1985) in the Eiras do Faião sill, but were not sampled in 

this study. The same author also sampled only one peridotitic xenolith in the LCV that 

contained olivine showing deformation bands, with the remaining minerals being 

clinopyroxe and oxides. 

 

6.1.12 Summary and discussion 

 
The petrographic descriptions made above allow for the inference of a 

simplified crystallization order in the observed rocks, leaving out some of the more 

specific mineral assemblages (fig. 6.3). 

The first phases to crystallize would then be Cr-Al rich spinels (Cr2O3 35-7 

%, Al2O3 19-5 %, see 6.2.5) followed by olivine, in which they are often included. 

Olivine is an important constituent in most basic rocks but does not occur in the 

more evolved basic rocks (e.g. some of the Sintra, Sines and Monchique gabbros) 

and in the intermediate rocks. 

They are followed by Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxenes, with the latter 

showing inclusions of all the previously mentioned these minerals. Fe-Ti oxide and 



 

128 
 

clinopyroxene crystallization will continue throughout the evolution of these rocks, 

while Cr-Al spinel is only found in the more basic, undifferentiated terms.  

 

 
Fig. 6.3: Diagram showing a simplified crystallization order for the studied samples.  

 

Amphibole might be the fourth phase to crystallize in the basaltic rocks. 

These minerals sometimes show inclusions of olivine, Fe-Ti oxides and 

clinopyroxene in the basic porphyritic rocks. But in the gabbros amphibole 

crystallization should be preceded by plagioclase since in these rocks amphibole 

distinctively shows plagioclase inclusions. 

Apatite should start to crystallize approximately at the same time as 

plagioclase and amphibole since it is often found in the matrix of basaltic rocks and 

in inclusions on amphibole found in gabbros. 

 

 
Fig. 6.4: Conditions under which hornblende grains can form pyroxene + plagioclase + Fe-Ti oxides rims. The solid 
line shows the stability field of hornblende after (Rutherford and Hill, 1993). Adapted from Plechov et al., 2008. 

 



 

129 
 

Feldspar appears relatively late in some of the gabbros but its crystallization 

continues in the intermediate rocks. 

The existence of amphibole phenocrysts reacting with the liquid resulting on 

the formation of rims of oxides, plagioclase and clinopyroxene in the basal lava 

flows of the LVC (e.g. Negrais) might be caused by pressure release and 

dehydration during ascension and eruption, which led to the destabilization of the 

amphibole (fig. 6.4). Given that in some cases the amphibole did not have time to 

fully react and complete the transformation into these products, it can be speculated 

that the ascension and eruption of these magmas was relatively fast, in a scale of 

days (e.g. Rutherford and Hill, 1993; Rutherford and Devine, 2003). 

Alternatively, amphibole destabilization can also occur isobarically, during 

the recharge of a magma chamber with a more basic, hotter magma (e.g. Ruthford 

and Devine, 2003; Plechov et al., 2008). The recharging liquid can also be drier, 

leading to further destabilization of the hydrated minerals (e.g. Reagan et al., 1987). 

The distinction between these two hypotheses for amphibole rim formation will be 

discussed in further detail in section 6.2. 

Amphibole is also found to be frequently associated with apatite in 

xenocrysts (with the apatites occurring as inclusions in the amphibole) and 

xenoliths. This association has been interpreted by some authors as resulting from 

the crystallization of carbonatitic or alkaline silicic carbonated magmas at mantle 

depths (Wass, 1979; O’Reilly and Griffin, 2000). 

The presence of xenoliths, whose textures show evidence for 

recrystallization, and in the case of the sieve textured clinopyroxenes, even partial 

melting, supports the notion that these might have formed in deeper magma 

chamber or conduit. They were later remobilized by a new, hotter magma pulse 

where they reequilibrated and perhaps even underwent partial melting due to 

heating and decompression during ascension. 

Accordingly, the observation of both recrystallization in xenoliths and 

reaction rims around amphibole xenocrysts is evidence for reequilibration and 

adjustment to lower pressure and/or higher temperature conditions. 

Finally, the simultaneous existence of two different kinds of clinopyroxene 

in the same magma, as observed in several of the intrusive rocks, might be an 

indicator of magma mixing and therefore, a complex pre-installation history (e.g. 



 

130 
 

Duda and Schminke, 1985; Dobosi, 1989; Dobosi and Fodor, 1992; Martins, 1999; Pilet 

et al., 2002), and shall be discussed in more detail in the mineral chemistry section 

(6.2).

6.2. Mineral Chemistry 

 
The chemical characterization of the main petrographic phases of the sampled 

lithologies was done by Electronic Microprobe Analysis in the Laboratório de 

Microssonda Electrónica of the Centro de Geologia da Universidade de Lisboa under 

the technical supervision and orientation of Dr. Pedro Celestino Reis. 

The analyses were performed on polished thin sections using a JEOL JXA 8200 

electron microprobe. An acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 25 nA 

were used. The electron beam was focused to 5 µm diameter. Typical uncertainties are 

below 2% for the major oxides.  

The analyzed elements in each mineral group were calibrated using the standards 

indicated in table 1 in annex IV.  

The more relevant lithologies in most of the sampled occurrences were chosen 

for analysis, with the addition of a sample from the Monchique nepheline syenites in 

order to compare the composition of their green clinopyroxenes with the green cores 

recognized in the clinopyroxenes of some mafic rocks (see section 6.1). 

 

6.2.1 Olivine 

 
In the studied rocks, olivine is a major constituent of basalts, as well as of some 

of the lamprophyres, where it occurs as a phenocryst phase. It is also present in some of 

the gabbros. The structural formula of the analyzed olivines was calculated on a 

basis of 4 oxygens.  

The chemical variation of the olivine mineral group can be described as a solid 

solution series between forsterite, an Mg rich component (Fo: Mg2SiO4), and fayalite, 

the Fe rich component (Fa: Fe2SiO4). It shows a tendency for increasing the fayalite 

contents with differentiation, whereas the more Fo rich compositions are thought to be 

products of crystallization from less evolved magmas characterized by lower Mg/(Mg + 

Fe ratios. 

Compositional variations in this mineral are described using the forsterite (Fo = 

100 × [Mg/(Mg + Fe)]) contents as a differentiation index, as shown in figs. 6.5-6.  



 

132 
 

Olivines from basalts show some compositional variation, with the cores of 

phenocrysts being more Fo rich (Fo &gt; 85%) than their rims, than the microphenocrysts 

and than the matrix minerals. Taking into consideration that ???
??/??? (with D being the 

partition coefficient, in this case between Mg and the olivine-liquid pair DMg = 

???
?? /???

??? ) tends to increase with decreasing temperature (e.g Roeder and Emslie, 1970), 

such compositional evolution is interpreted as a result of progressive Mg depletion in 

the liquid with olivine crystallization in a cooling magmatic system.  

 

 
Fig. 6.5: classification of the analyzed olivines according to their abundances in forsterite (Fo – Mg2SiO4) 

and fayalite (Fe2SiO4). 

 

The olivines in the Mafra gabbroic plug also show relatively high Fo contents (&gt; 

83%), while the ones in the Sines gabbro show the lower Fo and higher Fa contents in 

all of the analyzed rocks, reflecting crystallization from a less Mg rich, more evolved 

liquid.  

 In general, MnO contents increase with decreasing forsterite contents while NiO 

and SiO2 decrease (fig. 6.6). CaO contents of olivines show two distinct trends: the first 

one characterized by the progressive increase of CaO with decreasing Fo and is seen in 

the LVC’s rocks and in the Mafra gabbro, while a second trend is discernable in the 

Sines gabbro and in crystals with Fo &amp;lt;73%, marked by a decrease in CaO. 



 

133 
 

The decrease in NiO agrees with progressive depletion in this element in the 

liquid due to earlier olivine and clinopyroxene crystallization.  

 

 
Fig. 6.6: Variation of the concentrations of CaO, MnO, NiO and SiO2 with the content in Forsterite (Fo) 

for the analysed olivines. 

 

During olivine crystallization the rapid reduction of the Ni contents in the melt 

would create space in the crystal lattice of olivine, which can lead to increasing Ca 

substitution. However, the crystallization of Ca-rich clinopyroxene and plagioclase 

would result in the depletion of Ca in the residual melt, which is probably the reason for 

the decrease in CaO contents observed in olivine below ? Fo 73. Therefore, the notorious 

decrease in CaO seen in the Sines gabbro is likely to be the result of continuing olivine 



 

134 
 

crystallization after the onset of clinopyroxene and/or plagioclase crystallization and 

removal, since these minerals incorporate more CaO.  

The rise in MnO in the olivine composition with decreasing Fo in the basalts is 

related to the higher availability of this incompatible element in more evolved liquids 

and due to the increasing compatibility of Mn in more Fa rich olivines (e.g. Beattie et 

al., 1991). The lack of a Mn increase in the more Fa rich olivines from the Sines 

gabbros is probably due to reduced Mn availability caused by its removal from the melt 

by the precipitation of a more Mn rich Fe-Ti oxides (MnO 0.7-1.2%). 

The distribution coefficient for the Fe/Mg ratio between olivine and liquid 

(????/??
??????  = (???

?? /???
?? ) ? (???

???/???
??? ), where X is the molar fraction) was also 

calculated, assuming the whole rock analysis as representative of the liquid from which 

the olivines crystallized, and that this liquid would have a Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of 0.2 

(Middlemost, 1989 in Rollinson, 1993). The ????/??
??????  value is independent of 

temperature and pressure variations and is of approximately 0.3 ± 0.03 for situations 

where the olivine is in equilibrium with the composition of the magmatic liquid (Roeder 

and Emslie, 1970; Beattie et al., 1991). 

Assuming that there is equilibrium and ????/??
??????  = 0.3 ± 0.03, the composition 

of the possible olivine-liquid pairs can be calculated using the following expression: 

 

????/??
?????? = ?(? ? ????) ? ??#???? ? [???? ? (? ? ??#???)] 

 

where ??#??? =  
??????

(??????+??????)
 and ???? is the calculated forsterite content of the 

olivines. 

The resulting curves were plotted on fig. 6.7 together with the analyzed rock-

mineral pairs. 

Most of the calculated ????/??
??????  values were different from the expected average 

of 0.3 ± 0.03 predicted for olivines in equilibrium with the host magma (Roeder and 

Emslie, 1970). The higher values correspond mostly to the ones observed in the rims of 

phenocrysts and in matrix crystals and occur in the samples from the LVC’s Monte 

Serves neck, the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug, and especially the Sines gabbro. The lower values 



 

135 
 

occur only in the Negrais lava flow of the LVC and are typically found in crystal cores 

(fig. 6.7). The only olivines that show ????/??
??????  values indicative of equilibrium 

between the crystal and the host liquid are some of the crystals present in the Monte 

Serves neck, the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug and the Negrais flow.  

 
Fig. 6.7: Fosterite contents of the olivines vs. whole rock composition. Also represented is the variation 

of the forsterite content in olivines with the changing Mg# of a magmatic liquid for rocks with ????/??
??????  

values between 0.27 and 0.33. 

 

The higher than expected ????/??
??????  values mean that the olivine is richer in FeO 

than it would be observed if this mineral was in equilibrium with a liquid whose 

composition is equivalent to the whole rock analysis. These higher than expected 

????/??
??????  observed in some rocks might be due to the analyzed whole rock composition 

not being representative of the liquid composition from which the olivines crystallized. 

This may happen if either previous crystallization of other phases such as spinel, 

clinopyroxene or even olivine changed the FeO/MgO of the liquid or due to an increase 

of MgO in the liquid by to accumulation and consequent resorption of MgO-rich 

olivine.  

Alternatively, the whole rock composition can be biased towards more MgO-

rich contents, reflecting the “input” from the olivine crystals in the analysed samples, 



 

136 
 

which would consequentially change FeO/MgO of the whole rock and assumed liquid 

composition. This can be significant in samples that show evidence for important crystal 

accumulation, such as the Sines gabbro. 

There is also the possibility that the observed whole rock composition reflects 

the mixing of magmas with different Fe/Mg ratios, but although some of the crystals are 

rounded, which might taken to be an indication of post crystallization reaction, the lack 

of reverse zoning in the olivines apparently rules out this hypothesis. 

The accumulation of olivine, causing the whole rock analysis not to be 

representative of the liquid from which the analyzed olivines precipitated seems the 

most reasonable explanation for the very high ????/??
??????  values observed for the olivines 

in the Sines gabbro. The presence of macroscopic layering in the outcrops where this 

lithology was sampled, and the textural and geochemical characteristics of these rocks 

(see sections 4.1.7 and 6.1.7) support their formation by accumulation processes. 

As for the lower than expected ????/??
??????  and consequent higher forsterite values 

observed in the Mafra gabbro and some of the cores of crystals in the Negrais flow, they 

indicate that these olivines are more magnesian than expected in a rock with that Mg#. 

These high ????/??
??????  values are usually calculated for crystal cores and might be due to 

the early crystallization of some olivine cores in the ascending magmas that were not 

immediately separated from the liquid, which later crystallized as the Mafra gabbro and 

the basalts. The hypothesis that these crystals/cores precipitated from an earlier, more 

primitive magma is not supported by the absence of reverse zoning in the crystals. 

According to Roeder and Emslie (1970) it is possible to estimate the 

crystallization temperature of olivines in equilibrium with the liquid, by knowing the 

distribution coefficient for Mg between the olivine and the magmatic liquid (???
??????) 

using the expression: 

 

??????
?????? =  

????
?

? ?. ?? 

 

where T is the temperature in Kelvins. 

 Beattie (1993) proposed a different, theorectically more precise method for the 

calculation of the saturation temperature for olivine, given that it takes into account 



 

137 
 

several compositional effects. It is based on non regular solid solution models for 

silicate melts, integrates several thermodynamic characteristics of the crystal-melt pair 

and is supposed to have an error of approximately 10º K. The equation used to 

determine the temperature values is:

where ??? is the temperature of saturation of olivine in K, R is the gas constant, P the 

pressure in Pa, ???

??and  ???
??the enthalpy, entropy and volumes of fusion of the 

M component in olivine, ????

fraction of the Network Forming cations [NF = 7/2*ln(1-?????.?
? ) + 7*ln (1- ??????

? )]. 

 ???
?????? was calculated according to the method developed by Beattie (1993), 

which allows the determination of this value with the data relative to the melt phase 

alone:  

???
?????? =  

??? ? ? ??
?? ????

????
?=?

? ??
?? ????

????
?=?

 

Where ??? is the molar proportion of cations in the M site of olivines (0.666), ????
???  is 

the molar concentration of MgO in the liquid, and ??
?? and ??

?? are empirical constants 

given in Beattie (1993). 

 ???
?????? was also determined using the method devised by Beattie et al. (1991) 

where ???
?????? = ???

?????? ? ???
?????? + ???

??????, where ???
?????? and ???

?????? are empirical 

constants given in Beattie et al. (1991). 

The results obtained for each of the occurrences where olivine was found to be 

in equilibrium with the magma is summarized in table 6.1. 

The calculated ???
?????? shows good agreement between the values obtained from 

the compositions of the magma and crystals and the ones computed using the equations 

proposed by Beattie et al. (1991), except for the MgO and Ni poorer sample, where the 



 

138 
 

calculated D is much higher than the measured one (table 6.1). The equations derived to 

describe the variation of ???
??????  with MgO concentrations in the liquid (Hart and 

Davis, 1978; Mata, 1996) do not predict a decrease in this value with decreasing MgO 

in the liquid, and neither does the equation by Beattie et al. (1991) that relates ????
??????  

with ???
??????, so this low value might be an artifact caused by the low Ni contents of the 

analyzed rim of olivine, whose composition is most likely not in equilibrium with the 

whole rock composition that was assumed to represent the liquid phase. 

The calculated temperatures correspond to olivine saturation temperatures at 1 

bar and should reflect the temperature of the magma during the onset of olivine 

crystallization at surface conditions. 

Average temperatures calculated for the saturation temperatures of olivine vary 

between a maximum of 1278º C in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug and a minimum of 1154 ºC 

in the Negrais flow, showing lower temperatures in the extrusive lava flow than in the 

intrusives, as would be expected, as shown in table 6.1.

produce higher temperatures, both of them generate similar results with a maximum 

difference of 30º C between the temperatures obtained with the two thermometers.  

As was previously noted by Mata (1996), the similarity between the values 

obtained using these two very different equations reflects the dominance of the ???

value in the calculations, with the crystallization temperature being almost an inverse 

linear function of ??????
??????, whereas the other compositional and thermodynamic 

parameters will have little importance on the final values obtained for the olivine 

saturation temperature. 

 
6.2.2 Clinopyroxene 

 
As was previously described in section 6.1, clinopyroxenes are one of the more 

abundant and petrographically diverse minerals present in the studied rocks, showing 

several types of zonation and color, sometimes even within the same sample (e.g. figs. 

6.1, 6.8). 

These minerals are also one of the main phases present in the rare ultramafic 

xenoliths, and can therefore provide valuable information about the nature of the 

magma from which they precipitated. Consequently, the clinopyroxenes from the 

xenoliths found in samples from the Fontanelas seamount and Eiras do Faião sill 

were also analyzed. 

The structural formula for the analyzed pyroxenes was calculated on a basis 

of 6 oxygens, with Fe2+ and Fe3+ being calculated according to Droop (1987). 

They are mostly Quadrilateral Ca-Mg-Fe clinopyroxenes (fig. 6.9a, c), and only 

a few of the crystals fall in the Ca-Na clinopyroxene field (fig. 6.9a, c), according to the 

classification of Morimoto (1988).  

These Ca-Na pyroxenes correspond to aegirine-augites and are found in the 

Monchique nepheline syenites and as green cores in the clinopyroxenes of a 

lamprophyre dyke from Loulé (C-20). 

On the triangular Ferrosilite (Fs - Fe2Si2O6) – Enstatite (Es - Mg2Si2O6) – 

Wollastonite (Wo - Ca2Si2O6) diagram (fig. 6.9b, d), most of the samples plot on the 

augite and diopside  fields, with only a few of the cores of the green cored 



 

140 
 

clinopyroxenes in the Eiras do Faião tephritic sill and in the lavas of the Fontanelas 

seamount plotting on the hedenbergite field.  

 

 
Fig. 6.8: Backscatter electron images of clinopyroxene phenocrysts in basic porphyritic rocks: a) green 

cored clinopyroxene in Loulé lamprophyre (C-20); b) green cored clinopyroxene in the Malveira da Serra 

sill (RM 25); c) composite green cored clinopyroxene in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug (RM 36); clinopyroxene 

(Clinopyroxene) phenocrysts in the Negrais flow, with oxide inclusion. 

 

Some samples show Wo &gt; 50% and plot on the wollastonite field, but actually 

correspond to diopsides. The increase of Wo is an artifact caused by the incorporation 

of non Quad components (e.g. aegirine NaFe3+Si2O6) in the structure of the 

clinopyroxenes that formed in silica undersaturated magmas. 

In general, as differentiation progresses, the samples seem to become more 

depleted in Mg, evolving towards compositions more enriched the Fs and Wo 

molecules, which will also incorporate other non Quad components.  

The Sintra gabbro and the more evolved Montelevar sill seem to show two 

distinct kinds of clinopyroxene with contents in Wo and Fs.

clinopyroxenes in porphyritic (a,b) and granular (c,d) samples. 

 

As was previously described in section 6.1, some samples contain 

clinopyroxenes with a specific type of zoning, showing a green core surrounded by a 

colorless to pink mantle and rim (e.g. figs. 6.1, 6.8), as well as the more common 

Clinopyroxenes that show a colorless to pink core, with the rims showing a more 

intense shade of the same color. In order to investigate the differences in the chemical 



 

142 
 

compositions of these cores, a series of profiles were made across normally zoned and 

green cored crystals. Two representative compositional profiles are pictured in fig. 6.10.  

By analyzing the compositional profiles of each of these groups of 

clinopyroxenes, we can observe that the crystals with normal zoning (fig. 6.10) possess 

a core richer in MgO and Cr2O3 with the rims being progressively enriched in Al2O3, 

TiO2, FeO, and to a lesser degree in Na2O in relation to the core. This is the result of a 

progressive depletion of the liquid in MgO and Cr2O3 due to the simultaneous 

crystallization of spinel and olivine, and consequential raise in Al2O3, TiO2, FeO and 

Na2O. 

 

 
Fig. 6.10: Examples profiles across clinopyroxenes with reverse (top, green cored clinopyroxene in 

Ribeira d’Ilhas plug) and normal (bottom, pink cored clinopyroxene in Ribeira d’Ilhas plug) zonation in 

clinopyroxenes. 

 

On the other hand, the zonation pattern is reversed in the green cored 

clinopyroxenes. The cores are richer in FeO and Na2O and depleted in MgO, Cr2O3, 
Al2O3 and TiO2 in relation to the mantles and rims. As the analysis progress towards the 



 

143 
 

rims of these crystals there is an abrupt transition in the abundances of most elements 

from the green core to the colorless to pink mantle, where the clinopyroxenes becomes 

more MgO, Cr2O3, Al2O3 and TiO2 rich and FeO and Na2O poor, showing similar 

compositions to the cores in the normally zoned crystals. As the rim of the mineral 

approaches, however, FeO, Al2O3 and TiO2 increase and MgO and Cr2O3 decrease, in 

the same way to what happens in a normally zoned clinopyroxene, due to the ongoing 

crystallization of spinel and olivine that causes the concentrations of these elements to 

decrease in the liquid. 

These green cored, reversely zoned clinopyroxenes are found in the porphyritic 

basic rocks and their peculiar zonation appears to have formed when a basic, MgO and 

Cr2O3 rich magma mixed and entrained green crystals precipitated from a more evolved, 

FeO and Na2O rich but MgO, Cr2O3 and TiO2 depleted liquid. This episode was 

responsible for the partial resorption of the green clinopyroxenes and the growth of 

more primitive, Cr2O3, MgO and TiO2 rich and Na2O, FeO poor mantles. After the 

homogenization of the mixed liquid, the pyroxenes continued to grow, with the 

compositions of the rims evolving towards higher TiO2, Na2O, Al2O3 and lower MgO, 

Cr2O3 as crystallization progressed. 

The simultaneous existence of these reversely zoned phenocrysts in the same 

samples with normally zoned ones puts forward that mixing and hybridization processes 

between magmas in different states of evolution taking place at depth can be regarded as 

an important process in generating the petrological diversity observed in the basic 

alkaline rocks of the WIM, as it has been proposed for other intraplate alkaline 

provinces (e.g. Duda and Schminke, 1985; Dobosi, 1989; Dobosi and Fodor, 1992; Ho 

et al., 2000; Sachs and Hansteen, 2000; Pilet et al., 2002, Marchev et al., 2006). This 

issue will be addressed in more detail later in this section and in the summary of this 

chapter (6.2.6). 

The compositional variations with Mg# for some major elements of in the 

clinopyroxenes present in basic porphyritic rocks are displayed in figs. 6.11 to 6.14. 

From the observation of fig. 6.11, it is shown that the green cores show 

significantly different compositions from the other clinopyroxenes found in the same 

rocks. They are systematically richer in FeO and Na2O but generally poorer in TiO2, 

MgO,  Cr2O3  and sometimes even in  CaO and Al2O3,  than  the normally  zoned  pink

However, and confirming the conclusions drawn from the compositional profiles across 

green cored crystals, the rims of the green cored crystals show similar compositions to 

the cores and rims of the normally zoned pink clinopyroxene and matrix crystals, 

suggesting that these rims crystallized from a magma similar to the one from which the 

remaining phenocrysts formed, while the cores originated from a liquid with a different, 

more evolved composition.

The crystals present in the basic porphyritic rocks as inclusions in phenocrysts, 

occurring in aggregates and amigdulae or showing inclusions of olivine or abundant Fe-

Ti oxides show are represented separately since it is possible that these many types of 



 

148 
 

occurrence could present significant differences in elemental abundances. Nonetheless, 

they show compositional ranges identical to the normally zoned clinopyroxenes, 

suggesting similar crystallization conditions for these phases (fig. 6.12). The higher 

Mg#, Cr2O3 and lower FeOt and TiO2 shown by the clinopyroxenes with olivine 

inclusions, as well as by the ones that occur as aggregates, can indicate that these 

represent earlier crystallization products from the same or a similar liquid.

t in the 

clinopyroxenes present in the xenoliths, Monchique nepheline syenites and in the green cores of reversely 

zoned clinopyroxenes occurring in basic porphyritic rocks. 

 

The clinopyroxenes found in the uncontaminated intrusive granular lithologies 

(Mafra, Sintra, Sines and Monchique gabbros, Monchique nepheline syenites and 

xenoliths) show a narrower compositional range (figs. 6.9 and 6.13) than those found in 

the basic porphyritic rocks. Some of these, such as in the case of the Mafra, Monchique 

and Sines gabbros, show compositional affinities with the diopsides and Ti-augites 



 

149 
 

observed in the porphyritic basaltic rocks, hinting that they might have crystallized from 

a similar parental liquid (fig 6.14). The Sintra gabbros, however, show clinopyroxenes 

that are more depleted in TiO2 and in some cases CaO than the ones found in the basic 

rocks from the LVC and in the remaining intrusive complexes. 

On the other hand, the more FeO rich, green colored clinopyroxenes in the 

xenoliths and nepheline syenites from Monchique seem to show some affinities with the 

green clinopyroxene cores found in the basic porphyritic rocks (figs. 6.13 and 6.15). 

However, the aegirine-augites from the Monchique nepheline syenites tend to be more 

enriched in Na2O, at certain Mg#, and show lower TiO2, CaO and Al2O3 concentrations 

than the green cores in basic porphyritic rocks (fig. 6.15), arguing that the green cores 

found in the basic porphyritic rocks in the WIM did not form in a similar nepheline 

syenite magma at upper crustal pressure and temperature conditions. 

The clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths show more diverse compositions than those 

in the nepheline syenites, but are similar to the crystals observed in some of the green 

cores (fig. 6.15), hinting for a similar origin for the cores in the reversely zoned 

clinopyroxenes and the clinopyroxenite and hornblendite xenoliths that are present in 

the same outcrops at times (e.g. Ribeira d’Ilhas plug, Eiras dos Faião sill, Fontanelas 

seamount). However, not all of the green cores in reversely zoned clinopyroxenes are 

similar in composition to the clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths, namely the more CaO, 

Al2O3 and TiO2 depleted and Na2O, FeO rich, which probably formed from a more 

evolved melt. 

If the clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths and in the green cores are in fact related, 

this implies that the green cores precipitated at depth from a magma, which also 

generated the xenoliths by crystallization and accumulation processes. The green cores 

and xenoliths must have been remobilized and mixed with an ascending, more primitive 

basaltic liquid where their partial resorption and the formation of their more primitive 

clinopyroxene rims took place.  

The contaminated Montelevar and Paço d’Ilhas sills and one of the dykes in 

Cascais dyke show clinopyroxene compositions that reflect the degree of evolution of 

the rocks that contain them (fig. 6.16). The Cascais dyke is a hawaiite and thus is less 

evolved than the rocks that constitute both of the sills (mostly mugearitic to benmoreitic 

compositions) and its clinopyroxenes show compositions similar to the normally zoned 

clinopyroxenes present in the basic porphyritic rocks of the LVC (fig. 6.16).

151 
 

The clinopyroxenes in the more evolved and Si-rich Paço d’Ilhas and 

Montelevar sills are poorer in MgO, TiO2, Cr2O3 and Al2O3, but richer in SiO2 and FeOt 

(fig. 6.16). 

The intermediate Montelevar sill seems to show two different clinopyroxene 

populations, with distinct contents in FeOt, Al2O3 and TiO2 (fig. 6.16).  

The clinopyroxenes from these sills, although showing similar contents in some 

elements, do not show the same optical and chemical characteristics as the 

clinopyroxenes found in the green cores and therefore these cores cannot have 

crystallized from similar intermediate, contaminated liquids in upper crustal pressure 

and temperature conditions.

152 
 

It is clear from figure 6.17, that the green cores in the reversely zoned 

clinopyroxenes are clearly distinct in terms of Mg and Al composition from their rims, 

from the other clinopyroxenes (mostly Clinopyroxenes) that occur in the same basic 

porphyritic rocks and from the green clinopyroxenes from the Monchique nepheline 

syenites. They do, however, show some affinities with the ones found in the xenoliths, 

again suggesting a common origin for these cores and the clinopyroxenes in the 

xenoliths. 

These green clinopyroxene cores and the clinopyroxenes found in the xenoliths 

must have therefore formed from a more evolved, Mg depleted liquid, but that was 

enriched in Na2O and FeO. This liquid is not compatible with the basanitic liquid that 

hosts the reversely zoned clinopyroxenes and from which their Clinopyroxene rims and 

the other clinopyroxenes crystallized, neither with the nepheline syenite where the green 

clinopyroxenes from Monchique formed, so it should have had some intermediate 

composition between these two extremes. 

 

 
Fig. 6.18: Aliv vs. Alvi (a.p.f.u.) contents for the clinopyroxenes from the porphyritic basic rocks (a) and 

from the granular intrusives (b). Pressure fields from Aoki and Shiba (1973). 

 

Clinopyroxenes with higher amounts of Al (a.p.f.u. - atoms per formula unit) in 

octahedral coordination (Alvi), and therefore higher Alvi/Aliv ratios (&gt; 0.25), are formed 



 

153 
 

at higher pressures, where more jadeitic molecule (NaAlSi2O6) is incorporated into the 

clinopyroxenes (Aoki and Shiba 1973; Wass, 1979).  

As can be seen of fig. 6.18a, the samples showing higher amounts of Alvi are the 

green cores and the pyroxene with olivine inclusions. In the case of the clinopyroxenes 

with olivine inclusions, it is likely that they crystallized at higher depths, at an early 

stage in the magma crystallization history, and shortly after the olivine they involve, and 

were later brought to shallower depths.  

As for the green cored clinopyroxenes, the fact that the most of them plot in the 

high pressure field comes to reinforce the possibility of their derivation from 

crystallization in a deeper conduit or chamber. Also, the majority of the analysis in rims 

and mantles plots well into the low pressure field, as a result of their more superficial 

origin. This indicates that the more evolved green cores crystallized at higher depths 

than their more primitive rims. 

Intrusive granular rocks plot mostly in the low pressure field (fig. 6.18b), as 

expected due to their relatively shallow intrusion depth.  

Some of the clinopyroxenes from the more evolved Montelevar and Paço d’Ilhas 

sills, Monchique syenites and a few samples from the Sintra gabbro plot in the high 

pressure field, but this is likely to be a consequence of their higher SiO2 content which 

means that most of the Al present in their structure will be in octahedral coordination 

(Alvi) since most of the tetrahedral positions will be occupied by Si, which will 

consequently generate higher Alvi/Aliv ratios.   

Several clinopyroxenes from the xenoliths also plot in the higher P field which is 

another indication of crystallization at higher pressures, as was the case with the green 

cored clinopyroxenes. 

The positive correlation for Ti and Aliv (a.p.f.u.) is an indicator of the importance 

of the (Mg, Fe2+) M1 + 2SiT ? TiM1 + 2AlT (Ti-Tschermakite) substitutions in the 

evolution of the series (fig. 6.19). This substitution is common in the more SiO2 

undersaturated magmas given that the crystallizing clinopyroxenes incorporate more Ti 

and Al in order to compensate for the lower Si contents.  

The matrix crystals, normally zoned phenocrysts and the rims of the green cored 

clinopyroxenes present in basic porphyritic rocks show Aliv/Ti ratios of approximately 3 

(fig. 6.19d), as do most of the gabbroic rocks in the intrusive complexes. The green 

cores and the clinopyroxenes in the xenoliths, as well as the Monchique nepheline 



 

154 
 

syenite show a different evolution trend, characterized by values closer to 4 for this 

same ratio (fig. 6.19d), since they contain less Ti. 

The more evolved magmas, such as the ones represented by the Montelevar sill 

and Monchique nepheline syenite (fig. 6.19b), crystallized clinopyroxenes with higher 

Aliv/Ti contents, similar to those shown by some of the green cores on clinopyroxenes in 

basic porphyritic rocks and by some of the pyroxenes in xenoliths as well, although the 

latter can show both higher Ti and Al contents. 
 

 
Fig. 6.19: Variation of the amounts of Ti with Aliv (a.p.f.u.) for all the analyzed samples: a) all 

clinopyroxenes present in basic porphyritic rocks; b) all clinopyroxenes in granular intrusive rocks; c) 

green cores of reversely zoned clinopyroxenes, pyroxenes in the Monchique nepheline syenite and 

xenoliths; d) normally zoned clinopyroxenes and rims and mantles of the reversely zoned clinopyroxenes 

in the basic porphyritic rocks. 



 

155 
 

Lower Al/Ti ratios have also been related to high pressure crystallization 

conditions (Thompson, 1974). Given this, the lower Al/Ti in the green cores compared 

with their rims points (fig. 6.19c,d) towards the existence of two separate phases of 

mineral formation: an initial crystallization phase at high pressure, when the cores 

formed, and a second one at lower pressure during which the more primitive rims and 

mantles formed, which is in agreement with the information obtained from the Aliv vs 

Alvi diagram. Magma mixing and high pressure crystallization will be discussed in 

further detail in section 6.2.6, integrating data from other mineral phases present in 

these rocks. 

Given that the Aliv/Ti ratio is almost always higher than 2 (fig. 6.19), other kind 

of substitutions must take place in the clinopyroxenes in order to maintain the charge 

balance. 

 

 
Fig. 6.20: Variation of the amounts of Fe3++Alvi +Na with Aliv (a.p.f.u.) for all the analyzed samples. 



 

156 
 

As can be seen on fig. 6.20, the analyzed clinopyroxenes show relatively high 

values of trivalent ions Al3+vi, Fe3+ (a.p.f.u.), and also of monovalent ions such as Na+, 

to compensate for the charge deficiency caused by the incorporation of Al3+ in the 

tetrahedral position, illustrating the importance of the CaM2 + (Mg, Fe2+)M1 + SiT ? 

2NaM2 + (Fe3+, Al)M1 + AlT substitutions, especially in the green cores, Monchique 

nepheline syenites and xenoliths, which also show the lower Aliv/Ti ratios.  

An effort was made to use the structural single pyroxene geobarometer 

developed by Nimis (1995, 1999) to try and quantify any possible differences in the 

crystallization depth of the different types of clinopyroxene cores, but the results 

yielded mostly negative pressure values, even in the clinopyroxenes that plot in the high 

pressure field of Wass (1979). 

This may be due to the construction of this geobarometer being based on 

changes of unit cell and M1 volumes with pressure, which means that it can be error 

prone in crystals with high Fe3+/Fe2+ values, as is the case in some of the green cores. 

High Fe3+ can lead to a change in the distribution of Fe2+ between the M1 and M2 sites 

and of Fe3+ in M1. This causes a change in the M1–O and M2–O bond lengths, and thus 

a change in the site volumes that is independent from pressure (Bindi et al., 1999). Also, 

the presence of water in the magma and later low pressure reequilibration of the green 

cores and xenoliths with the magma might have led to the lower than expected pressure 

values that are often equivalent to the ones obtained for the matrix crystals. 

Another possible cause for the absence of results using the Nimis (1995, 1999) 

geobarometer is the inability to obtain an accurate, independent estimate for the 

crystallization temperature of the clinopyroxenes, since this is a temperature dependent 

geobarometer.  

  

6.2.3 Plagioclase, feldspars and feldpathoids 

 
The analyzed rocks contain, besides the expected plagioclase and feldspars, 

several types of feldspathoids like nepheline and analcime. Nepheline is present as a 

matrix phase in one of the lamprophyric dykes of Loulé (C-20) and as a major 

constituent of the Monchique nepheline syenites, while analcime was found as a matrix 

constituent in the basic Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da Serra sills, in the Mafra 



 

157 
 

gabbro, the intermediate phono-tephritic Eiras do Faião and in the evolved Monchique 

nepheline syenites. 

The structural formula for the analyzed plagioclase and feldspars was 

calculated in a 32 oxygens basis.  

As for the feldspars and plagioclases, they can be classified and described 

according to the abundances of each of the terms of the three end member solid solution 

they form between anorthite (An - CaAl2Si2O8) and albite (Ab - NaAlSi3O8) and 

orthoclase (Or – KAlSi3O8).  

According to the high temperature feldspar nomenclature (e.g. Deer et al., 1966), 

they can be classified as either anorthite (An100-90), bitownite (An90-70), labradorite 

(An70-50), andesine (An50-30), oligoclase (An30-10), albite (Ab100-90), anorthoclase (Ab90-60, 
Or&lt;40), sanidine or microcline/orthoclase (Or40-100), (if they crystallize at higher 

temperatures in volcanic rocks the term sanidine is used, while the terms microcline/ 

orthoclase are employed for lower temperature crystallization in intrusive rocks). 

 

 
Fig. 6.21: Backscatter electron image of a rare plagioclase phenocryst surrounded by a matrix of 

clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and plagioclase on a sample from the Monte Serves neck of the LVC. 

 

On the basaltic rocks, the cores in the rare plagioclase phenocrysts vary mostly 

between bitownite and labradorite (An74-50), with their rims showing compositions 

within the same range. The matrix phases are mostly labradorite to andesine (An55-38) in 

the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug and show a range from labradorite to oligoclase (An67-23) in the 

basalts of the LVC. 

The basic Lomba dos Pianos sill seems to possess two different populations of 

phenocrysts with cores with An75-65 and An46-52. The rims of these phenocrysts cover a 



 

158 
 

wide compositional range, from bitownites to oligoclase (An73-29) with one the 

phenocrysts actually being rimmed by anorthoclase (An5Ab57Or39). The population with 

lower An contents might have a xenocrystic origin, since the minerals in the matrix 

shows higher anorthite contents (An68-63) than these labradorite-andesine cores. 

 

 

Fig. 6.22: Anorthite-albite-orthoclase (An-Ab-Or) ternary diagram showing the variability exhibited 

by plagioclase and feldspar crystals in the basaltic (in the front) and granular (in the background) 

rocks of Late Cretaceous age. 

 

The hawaiite that forms the Cascais dyke (sample RM 90) also seems to have 

two different phenocryst populations, one with An contents between An87-82 and the 

other between An68-52, with the rims showing a wider range of compositions (An79-37), 

while the matrix crystals show compositions with a more reduced An62-56 range. This 



 

159 
 

dyke also shows the more An rich plagioclases in the entire dataset, despite being more 

evolved than the basaltic rocks gabbros. 

The matrix crystals within the basic Malveira da Serra sill and Loulé dykes, both 

of which show lamprophyric affinities, range in composition from labradorite to 

oligoclase (An69-23).  Rare albite (Ab99-94) was also identified as a matrix phase. 

Sanidine is also present in the matrix of Loulé lamprophyre C-20 (Or92-82).  

The crystals that occur in amygdulae in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug are andesines 

(An46-31), with compositions similar to the matrix crystals.  

The plagioclases that form in the reaction rims of brown amphiboles in the 

basaltic liquid are more sodic, classifying either as andesines (An44Ab54) or 

anorthoclases (An3Ab86-82Or14-11). 

The phono-tephritic Eiras do Faião sill shows only alkaline feldspars 

(anorthoclase and microcline) in the matrix (Ab68-42Or55-30), while the mugearitic 

Montelevar sill shows mostly plagioclase (andesine to labradorite) cores (An65-40), 

which can have either andesine to labradorite (An54-46) or alkaline feldspar (Ab58-36Or63-

32 sanidine and anorthoclase) rims.  

 

 
Fig. 6.23: Compositional profile across a plagioclase crystal with oscillatory zoning from the 

Montelevar sill. 

 

Some of the plagioclase crystals in the Montelevar sill show oscillatory zoning, 

with alternating bands of more An enriched with more Ab rich layers (fig. 6.23). This 



 

160 
 

type of zoning can be produced by convection of a plagioclase crystal in a stratified 

magma chamber where the more evolved an more basic melts are located in different 

levels of the chamber, or reflect the injections of pulses of hotter, more mafic magma 

into a chamber of intermediate composition (e.g. Ginibre et al., 2002 and references 

therein). Alternatively, decompression crystallization in the sill can release latent heat 

which would then heat the magma and increase the An contents of plagioclase (Blundy 

et al., 2006). 

The intermediate Paço d’Ilhas sill shows crystals with cores whose compositions 

vary mainly between labradorite and rarer bitownite (An72-51). Also present are rare 

anorthoclase cores (An18 Ab59 Or23).  The rims of these crystals vary between 

labradoritic (An58-54) and andesinic (An29-20) and from anorthoclase (An15-3 Ab72-63 Or33-

14) to orthoclase/microcline (Or48 Ab50) compositions. 

The crystals from the Sintra gabbro have oligoclase (An27-23), and andesine-

labradorite-bitownite (An72-47) cores, with their rims covering the same compositional 

spectrum (An70-20). 

In the Sines gabbros, the cores of the plagioclases range from bitownites to 

labradorites (An82-50), while their rims are labradoritic to slightly andesinic (An64-48). On 

the gabbroic rocks present in Monchique, both sodic (An7-1Ab97-89 albite and oligoclase) 

and more calcic (An51-47 andesine-labradorite) plagioclase cores and rims were 

identified. In the Monchique nepheline syenites, however, all of the analysed crystal 

cores and rims are K rich feldspars (Or77-41). 

In the Mafra gabbro the larger plagioclase crystals show compositions ranging 

from bitownite to andesine (An78-45), while the smaller “matrix” crystals are more Na-

rich andesines (An50-34) or even potassic feldspar (Or94).  

The amount of anorthite (An) in plagioclase is related with the temperature of 

the magmatic system (e.g. Blundy and Wood, 1991, Bindeman et al., 1998). Also, the 

distribution coefficient D for a certain element in plagioclases with compositions within 

the An40-80 range is very dependent on both their An content and the crystallization 

temperature of the plagioclase, according to the expression below, proposed by Blundy 

and Wood (1991), Bindeman et al. (1998): 

 

????(?) = ? ? ?? + ? 
 



 

161 
 

where R is the gas constant (8.314 JK-1mol-1), T the temperature in K, An the molar 

anortite content ‘X’ is the slope and ‘Y’ the intercept in an RT ln(D) vs. An plot. 

So as the An content in plagioclase is controlled by temperature and liquid 

composition (e.g. Blundy and Wood, 1991, Bindeman et al., 1998), and is well 

correlated against the MgO content of the melt (Bédard, 2006), by knowing the An 

content of plagioclase crystals, it is possible to estimate the MgO content of the liquid 

contemporary to crystallization, and afterwards estimate the temperature of the melt in a 

plagioclase saturated system using the following expressions (Bédard, 2006): 

 

?? =   ? ? ??? +  ?  (for dry melts) 

 

?? =  ? ? ?? (???) +  ?  (for hydrous melts) 

 

? =  
?? ???

(? ? ??(???) +  ?)
 

 

With An being the molar anorthite content, MgO being the melt’s MgO content (in wt 

%) and T the temperature in ºC. X and Y are the slope and the Y axis intercept, 

respectively, of the fitting line for the regression of the interrelation of plagioclase An-

content, melt composition and temperature, for wet and dry systems. X and Y vary 

according to the table below (Bédard, 2006). 

 
Table 6.3: values for the X and Y parameters to use in the equations of Bédard (2006). 

for dry melts: X X std-error Y Y std-error 

MgO &amp;lt;1% (Tmin) 0.50206 0.09061 0.1009 0.10362 
MgO &gt; 1% 0.04448 0.00158 0.42132 0.07065 

for wet melts (Tmax) 0.10639 0.00444 0.57229 0.13285 

 

After the melt’s MgO content is estimated, it is possible to calculate the 

temperature of crystallization of the plagioclase crystals. 

The temperatures obtained by this method in several of the analyzed rocks are 

displayed in table 6.4. 

The highest average temperatures were obtained for the crystals with the 

higher An contents present as phenocrysts in the Lomba dos Pianos sill and Cascais 



 

162 
 

dyke, as well as in the cores of the crystals of the Mafra and Sines gabbro (1091, 

1266, 1118 and 1068 ºC, respectively) reflecting higher crystallization temperatures 

for plagioclase in these magmas.  

All of the analyzed matrix crystals reflect lower crystallization temperatures 

(880-1043ºC), as expected, since they correspond to the latest crystallizing phases 

in these rocks and probably formed during rapid cooling events.

The intermediate Montelevar sill, Monchique, Sines and Sintra gabbros and 

the rims of the other intrusive rocks, all show crystallization temperatures around 

900ºC, reflecting their crystallization in slowly cooling intrusive environments, 

which allowed for growth to take place at lower temperatures. 

The temperatures obtained for the phenocrysts cores II of the Lomba dos 

Pianos sill and Cascais dykes are lower (911 and 1000ºC) than the ones obtained for 

the rims, type I phenocrysts and even matrix crystals (1043 and 1013ºC), 

reinforcing the idea that these might be xenocrysts incorporated into the magma or 

have resulted from the mixing of a more evolved, cooler magma, with a hotter and 

more primitive melt.  

The existence of crystal cores with different An contents, and the consequent  

variation in crystallization temperatures obtained in the plagioclases of the Sintra 

gabbro, however, might be caused by different processes, such as secondary 

crystallization of more albite rich plagioclase during hydrothermal alteration, or the 

absence of the sampling of all the intermediate plagioclase compositions during 

analysis. 

As for the feldpathoids present and analyzed in these rocks, they include analcite 

in the matrix of the Eiras do Faião, Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da Serra sills, in the 

Mafra gabbro and in the Monchique nepheline syenite.

Nepheline was analyzed in the matrix of the Loulé lamprophyre C20 and in the 

Monchique nepheline syenite. 

Representative analyses of these two minerals are displayed in table 6.5. 

   

6.2.4 Amphibole 

 
In the studied rocks amphiboles can occur as normally or reversely (fig. 

6.24a) zoned phenocrysts rocks or more rarely as matrix components in basic 

porphyritic rocks. They are often a major constituent of gabbroic rocks, where they 

poikilitically involve the other mineral phases. They are also a major component in 

the xenoliths and can be found as large xenocrysts in basaltic plugs and flows, often 

showing signs of destabilization and dehydration (fig. 6.24b).  

 

 
Fig. 6.24: Backscatter electron image of amphibole phenocrysts. a) amphibole phenocrysts showing 

reverse zoning in the Malveira da Serra sill (RM 25); b) amphibole xenocryst showing a reaction rim of 

clinopyroxene and several oxide and sulphide inclusions on the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug (RM 36). 

 

The structural formula for the analyzed amphiboles was calculated on an 

anhydrous base, with 13 cations, including Ca, K and Na.  

These minerals are relatively homogenous in terms of composition and 

classify as calcic amphiboles (hornblendes, s.l.), namely pargasites and more 

frequently as kaersutites (Leake, 1997; fig 6.25).  

The pargasites occur in many of the analyzed types, such as crystals in the 

Sintra gabbro, the cores in the phenocrysts in the basic Malveira da Serra sill and 

Fontanelas seamount lavas, but also as xenocrysts reacting with the host magma in 

the Ribeira d’Ilhas basaltic (s.l.) plug. 



 

165 
 

Two green amphiboles formed by late hydrothermal alteration from the 

Sintra gabbro classify as magnesio-hornblendes (Na+K &amp;lt;0.5) and are clearly not 

related to the remaining analyzed suite (fig. 6.25). 

Also noticeable in fig. 6.25 is that amphiboles from the Sintra gabbro seem 

to show systematically lower contents in Ca and Na+K and higher Si and Fe 

(a.p.f.u.) that the remaining analyzed amphiboles. 

 

 
Fig. 6.25: Amphibole classification diagrams according to Leake et al. (1997). 

 

Amphiboles in the other gabbros show relatively homogenous compositions 

within each gabbro, with the ones in the Mafra and Monchique gabbro being more 

evolved, rich in K2O, TiO2, FeO and MnO and poorer in MgO and Na2O than the 

amphiboles in the Sines gabbro. By comparison, amphiboles from the Sintra gabbro  



 

166 
 

 
Fig. 6.26: K2O, Al2O3, TiO2, MnO, SiO2 content variation with Mg# in the amphiboles present in the 

intrusive rocks. 

 



 

167 
 

show systematically lower contents in CaO, Al2O3 and K2O and higher SiO2 and 

FeO than the remaining analyzed amphiboles, thus they appear to have formed from 

a different, more evolved magma, enriched in SiO2 and FeO but with less abundant 

alkali and TiO2 contents. 

 

 

Fig. 6.27: Representative compositional profiles across reversely zoned (A and B) amphiboles from the 

Malveira da Serra sill (RM 25). 

 

The differences in amphibole composition between gabbros do not mirror 

the differences in the abundance of the same elements in the whole rock 

geochemistry of these rocks, so they should reflect either late crystallization and 

growth, possibly from a residual intercumulus liquid, or accumulation of crystals 

forming from an evolving melt within a magma chamber. These hypotheses would 

render the composition of the whole rock analysis unrepresentative of the liquid 

from which the amphiboles formed.

Two types of cores can be identified in the amphiboles from the Malveira da 

Serra sill (figs. 6.26 and 6.27). One is more FeO, Na2O, Al2O3 and MnO rich, but 

MgO, TiO2 and K2O poor than the other.  

The more MgO rich cores correspond to normally zoned amphibole 

phenocrysts while the MgO poor cores belong to reversely zoned amphiboles as can 

be observed in the profiles shown in fig. 6.27. Reversely zoned clinopyroxenes 

were also identified in this sill (see 6.2.3 in this section). 

In the normally zoned crystals, the rims show lower MgO, but are enriched 

in TiO2, K2O, FeO and Na2O relative to the core, a trend also observed in 

clinopyroxenes and compatible with the progressive crystallization and removal of 

olivine.  

In the reversely zoned crystals, the rim first shows a lighter brown color and 

a more MgO, and TiO2 rich and Al2O3, MnO and FeO depleted composition. As one 

progresses towards the dark brown core, there is an abrupt change to lower MgO 

and TiO2 values and higher FeO, MnO and Al2O3 contents (fig. 6.27), concurrent 

with the normal evolution trends shown by a basic magma experiencing fractional 

crystallization.

The reverse zonation seen on some of the amphiboles from the Malveira da 

Serra sill, together with the same kind of zonation observed in clinopyroxenes in 

this and other intrusions, argues again for the existence of magma mixing and 

homogenization between a more evolved and a more primitive liquid at depth, prior 

to the installation of this sill. 

Amphiboles from the Fontanelas seamount show compositions similar to the 

ones found in other porphyritic basic rocks. 

The xenocrysts that reacted with the basaltic melt and developing reaction 

rims of clinopyroxene, oxides and sometimes plagioclase (see fig. 6.1 and section 

6.1 for more details) show compositions similar to the rims and cores of the 

normally zoned phenocrysts in the Malveira da Serra sill. This sill corresponds to 

an intrusive basic rock where amphibole appears to be stable, but where it also 

shows evidence for the existence magma mixing previous to installation at upper 

crustal depths. This suggests that the development of the reaction rims in 

amphiboles discussed in section 6.1.12 might be attributed to decompression and 

dehydration of the amphiboles, associated to the devolatilization of the magma, 

rather than to magma mixing.  

The amphibole xenocrysts show small differences in composition among 

themselves, namely in terms of K2O and MgO contents. The retrograding 

amphiboles in the Lomba dos Pianos sill show the lowest MgO and K2O values, and 

the ones in the Negrais flow have the highest MgO and K2O contents, while the 

crystals in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug have intermediate compositions between these 

two. These heterogeneities are probably a result of the crystallization of these 

minerals from magmas with slightly different compositions and degrees of 

evolution. 

The xenoliths show amphiboles with a range of compositions that overlap 

either the gabbros or the cores of reversely zoned amphiboles from the Malveira da 

Serra sill, implying formation from a liquid with similar characteristics. 

The more common types of substitutions in these rocks seem to be simple 

Mg for Fe2+ and Ti for Mg or Fe2+ in the octahedral position (fig. 6.28) and also Al 

for Si in the tetrahedral position if Ti is incorportated in M1, indicating important 

coupled Ti-tschermakite substitution ((Mg, Fe2+) M1 + 2SiT ? TiM1 + 2AlT), similarly 

to what what was observed for the clinopyroxenes.

The amphibole-plagioclase geothermometer for silica undersaturated rocks 

developed by Holland and Blundy (1994) was applied to the studied rocks where 

mineral chemistry data was available for plagioclase and amphibole pairs occurring 

in equilibrium. Since this geothermometer is pressure dependent and no pressure 

estimate is available for the crystallization of these amphiboles, the temperatures 

were calculated using pressures of 1, 2, 5 and 10 kbar. The expression that yields 

the equilibrium temperature between amphibole and plagioclase is:

The results are shown in table 6.6. In the intrusive rocks, the higher 

temperatures were obtained for the Sines, Mafra, and Monchique gabbros (1030-

980 ºC at 1 kbar) and the basic Lomba dos Pianos sill (? 1000 ºC, assuming both 

the amphiboles and plagioclase phenocrysts crystallized in equilibrium), than in the 

Sintra gabbro (910-880 ºC at 1 kbar) and in the Ribeira d’Ilhas basaltic plug (900-

800 ºC at 1 kbar). 

The amphiboles are a late phase in many of the gabbros, since they envelop 

most of the other minerals present in these rocks, so these low crystallization 

temperatures were expected. Even lower temperatures were obtained for the Ribeira 

d’Ilhas plug since the amphiboles in this rock occur in amigdulae and represent the 

crystallization products of the last remaining fraction of melt. 

The late hydrothermal green amphiboles in the Sintra gabbro show the 

lowest crystallization temperatures (? 630 ºC), supporting the hypothesis that they 

formed in secondary, subsolidus conditions after the crystallization of the 

remaining assemblage. 

Amphibole geobarometry using Al in amphibole geobarometers was not 

applicable to these samples since they are calibrated for silica saturated magmas 

(e.g. Hollister et al., 1987; Johnson and Rutherford, 1989; Schmidt, 1992; Anderson 

and Smith, 1995) where Al incorporation in amphibole is controlled by pressure, 

while in silica undersaturated rocks such as these, the Al contents in amphibole are 

also dependent in the availability of Si. 

 

6.2.5 Oxides  

 
The majority of the oxides present in basic igneous rocks are Fe-Ti oxides, along 

with rare Cr spinel.  

The structural formula for the spinels (magnetite, chromite and ulvospinel) 

was calculated in a 32 oxygens basis, while for the ilmenites these were calculated 

on a 6 oxygens basis.  

The results obtained for these analyses are displayed in ternary diagrams in 

accordance to their TiO2, FeO and Fe2O3 abundances (fig. 6.30). Also represented are 

the lines corresponding to the high temperature hematite (Fe2O3)-ilmenite(FeTiO3), and 



 

172 
 

magnetite(Fe3O4)-ulvospinel(Fe2TiO4) solid solutions defined by Buddington and 

Lindsley (1964). 

Most of the analyzed samples are titanomagnetites and plot close to the line that 

defines the magnetite-ulvospinel solid solution (fig. 6.30), indicating they contain 

significant amounts of Ti and variable quantities of Fe2+ and Fe3+. This high abundance 

of titanomagnetite and the relative scarcity of magnetite-ilmenite exsolution features in 

the oxides present in the basic porphyritic rocks argue for rapid cooling of most of these 

magmas. 

 

 
Fig. 6.29: backscatter electron images of: a) crystal of ilmenite (darker) showing magnetite exsolution 

and rim; b) exsolution of pleonaste (black rods) and ilmenite from magnetite, in the Negrais flow (RM 

43). 

 

In the studied samples, ilmenites are, in general, much rarer than Ti-magnetites 

and occur either as exsolution lamellae in magnetite (e.g. fig. 6.29) or more rarely as 

isolated crystals in the silica saturated sills (Paço d’Ilhas and Montelevar). 

The scarcity of ilmenite is a common situation in silica undersaturated rocks, 

since their low silica activity (?????) favours the incorporation of Ti in clinopyroxenes, 

forming Clinopyroxene and inhibiting the formation of ilmenite (Verhoogen, 1962), 

whose crystallization is also strongly dependent on the magma’s TiO2 content (e.g. 

Toplis and Carrol, 1995). According to Charmichael et al. (1974) and Mata and Munhá 

(2004), the reactions that expresses the control of ?????and ????? over the formation of 

these minerals are: 

2FeTiO3 + 2 CaAl2Si2O8 ? 2CaTiAl2O6 + Fe2SiO4 + 3SiO2 
                                    ilmenite                plagioclase                          pyroxene                 olivine                 silica 



 

173 
 

2FeTiO3 + Fe2SiO4 ? 2Fe2TiO4 + SiO2 
                                                           ilmenite                olivine                      spinel                melt 

 

On silica undersaturated melts, the reaction will progress towards the end 

members in the right. If silica is added to the system increasing ?????, then the reaction 

products will be driven to the left end member. Consequently, the presence of ilmenite 

in the SiO2 saturated sills is likely to be an effect of addition of silica to the system, 

probably as a consequence of assimilation of SiO2 rich crustal lithologies.

solid solutions from Buddington and Lindsley (1964). 

 

Chromite and chromian titanomagnetite were also identified and analyzed. They 

occur more frequently as inclusions in olivines, but can also be found as matrix crystals 

in the basaltic Ribeira d’Ilhas plug and as one of the opaque phases present in the Mafra 



 

174 
 

gabbro. Chromites have 16-35% Cr2O3, 10-18% Al2O3 and 3.5-10.4% MgO. Chromian 

titanomagnetites (Cr2O3 7-13%; Al2O3 5-19%; TiO2 8-16%) are rare but can be found as 

matrix crystals and phenocrysts (total of 4 analyses) in basic porphyritic rocks. 

In the basic porphyritic rocks (fig. 6.30a), phenocrysts, microphenocrysts and 

matrix crystals mostly plot in the magnetite-ulvospinel solid solution line, and are 

therefore mainly titanomagnetites (TiO2 35-6 %). Exsolution between titanomagnetite 

and ilmenite was observed in some phenocrysts as can be observed in fig. 6.29. 

Ilmenite can occur sporadically as a matrix phase in these rocks, but it is always 

associated with titanomagnetite exsolution.    

The oxide inclusions present in the silicate minerals of the basic porphyritic 

rocks (fig. 6.30b) display compositions similar to the matrix and phenocrystic phases, 

corresponding mostly to titanomagnetites (TiO2 5-24 %), but in some cases ilmenites 

and magnetites resulting from the exsolution of titanomagnetite were also identified.  

The types of oxide inclusions observed in silicated minerals are listed below:  

• The majority of the analyzed chromian spinels (Cr2O3 7-35%; Al2O3 5-18%) 

occur as inclusions in olivine, but can also be found in Clinopyroxene, meaning that this 

was one of the first phases to crystallize and to be removed from the melt. 

• Inclusions in olivines found in basalts and gabbros have mostly Cr-rich (7-35%) 

spinel inclusions although some titanomagnetites and magnetites can also be observed 

in olivines from the Sines gabbro (fig. 6.30c), that have the lowest forsterite contents of 

all the analyzed olivines (Fo &amp;lt;70%). 

• Plagioclases have Ti-rich titanomagnetite inclusions while the ones present in 

amphibole are more Fe3+ rich.  

• The minerals found partially included in the rims of clinopyroxene crystals are 

titanomagnetites and have compositions that are very similar to the oxides found in the 

matrix. 

• Within the same reaction rim, the oxides that result from the reaction of 

amphibole with the host magma are either ilmenites or titanomagnetites, suggesting that 

the amphiboles break down to two distinct oxide phases, one accommodating mostly 

FeO and some TiO2 and the other contains higher amounts of both Fe2O3 and TiO2. This 

suggests variable oxygen fugacity conditions during amphibole breakdown. 



 

175 
 

• Green cored clinopyroxenes and the Paço d’Ilhas sill have the more Fe2O3 rich 

titanomagnetite inclusions, with the former even showing one inclusion with Fe3+ rich 

ilmenite. 

While the oxides present in the basic porphyritic rocks are mostly 

titanomagnetites, the ones present in the gabbros can be either titanomagnetites or 

crystals containing magnetite with exsolved ilmenite lamellae. These exsolved crystals 

are substantially more common in the intrusives (Sintra, Sines and Monchique gabbros, 

Paço d’Ilhas sill, fig. 6.30c), since slower cooling facilitates this process.  

The Monchique and Sines gabbros show predominantly magnetites and 

ilmenites, indicating slow cooling conditions. 

The Mafra gabbro has two different oxide phases, one with a larger size with 

chromium spinel cores (Cr2O3 &gt; 30%) and titanomagnetite rims, and a smaller one 

made out exclusively of titanomagnetite.  

Ilmenites and magnetites from the Sintra gabbro are the more Fe2O3 rich of the 

oxides present in the gabbroic rocks, indicating equilibration with more oxidizing 

conditions. 

The phonotephritic Eiras do Faião sill shows more or less Ti rich 

titanomagnetites (3-20%) while in the intermediate Montelevar sill the oxide phases are 

both titanomagnetite and ilmenite, with the titanomagnetite (TiO2 13.6-18.1 %) 

sometimes exsolving from the ilmenite. The intermediate Paço d’Ilhas sill shows both 

titanomagnetite and ilmenite crystals, with exsolution features present in some of them. 

The Monchique nepheline syenites show only magnetites and titanomagnetites 

(TiO2 3-20 %) and hence must have formed from a more Ti depleted liquid. 

The Fe-Ti oxides present in the xenoliths (fig. 6.30c) are Fe3+ rich magnetites 

and titanomagnetites, which is in accordance with crystallization from a more oxidated 

and evolved melt. 

According to experimental work (Hill and Roeder, 1974) and empirical 

observations (e.g. Mata and Munhá, 2004), the existence of spinels with a 

compositional spectrum ranging from chromite to chromian titanomagnetite and 

titanomagnetite in the basic porphyritic rocks suggests that crystallization took place 

under relatively high oxygen fugacity (fO2) conditions, at least above the NNO (Ni-Ni 

oxide) buffer. 



 

176 
 

These relatively high oxygen fugacity conditions detected in the earlier spinels, 

suggests that the oxidizing conditions might have been inherited from a mantle source 

that had been previously metasomatized by an oxidizing agent (e.g. Mata and Munhá, 

2004). 

It is usually agreed that during magmatic evolution, the minerals from the 

ulvospinel-magnetite solid solution should show a trend in the direction of 

Fe3+enrichment and Ti depletion with increasing differentiation, in response to falling 

temperature (e.g. Charmichael et al., 1974; Haggerty, 1976). However, in the studied 

basaltic porphyritic rock this does not seem to be the case, with the later phases such as 

matrix crystals, microphenocrysts and inclusions in plagioclase showing higher TiO2 

contents that earlier phases like the phenocryst cores (fig 6.30).  

This trend can be the result of the progressive decrease of the oxygen fugacity 

conditions with increasing differentiation (Mata, 1996). At higher fugacities the reaction 

below will form the products on the right, meaning that Fe-rich spinels will crystallize 

incorporating a large portion of the available Fe3+.As fO2 and temperature decrease and 

TiO2 concentrations in the melt increase, the Ti-rich ulvospinel molecule will enter the 

spinel’s structure in higher amounts since there is less available Fe3+ and DTi increases 

with decreasing temperatures (Mata, 1996; Mata and Munhá, 2004).

Oxygen fugacity measures the chemical potential of oxygen in the form of 

adjusted pressure. It relates to the redox conditions of the magmas, which at a fixed T 

are more oxidizing at higher fugacities, and more reducing at lower fugacities. The 

variation of oxygen fugacity conditions with temperature can be described using redox 

buffers, which correspond to assemblages of minerals or compounds that constrain 

oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature. 

Oxygen fugacities (expressed as log fO2) and blocking temperatures of 

equilibration for the rocks that showed magnetite-ilmenite pairs were calculated 

applying the ILMAT program by Lepage (2003) that uses the geothermobarometer of 



 

177 
 

Andersen and Lindsley (1985) with the Mol % of ulvospinel and ilmenite being 

calculated according to Lindsley and Spencer (1982). 

The results are compiled in table 6.7 and fig. 6.31 and show log fO2 values 

varying between -27.7 in the basaltic Negrais lava flow and -13.10 in the Sintra gabbro 

with the accompanying blocking temperatures ranging from 500ºC in the Negrais flow 

plug to 850ºC in the Ribeira d’Ilhas basaltic plug.

Most of the samples plot along the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) and NNO 

redox buffers, or below the previous. The most oxidizing conditions appear to have 

occurred in the Sintra gabbro, which shows higher fugacities than the NNO buffer, and 

to a lesser degree in the Montelevar sill and Monchique gabbro, while the more 

reducing conditions were recorded in the LVC and Sines gabbros.  



 

178 
 

The more oxidizing conditions detected in the Sintra gabbro agree with the more 

Fe2O3 rich contents of their magnetites and ilmenites and could be related to subsolidus 

equilibration during a secondary alteration phase in more oxidizing conditions. 

However, the high temperature of equilibrium is not in agreement with this hypothesis, 

since it is ? 100º C higher than the one obtained for the crystallization of secondary 

amphibole. 

Blocking temperatures for the LVC lava flows are surprisingly low, both in the 

phenocrysts and the matrix, indicating slow cooling in the sampled basal flow, probably 

as a result of covering and isolation from rapid cooling by subsequent lava flows of the 

LVC’s lava pile.

QIF, quartz-iron-fayalite) 



 

179 
 

Equilibrium temperatures for the formation of the magnetite-ilmenite pairs in the 

reaction rims of amphiboles in the Negrais flow and Ribeira d’Ilhas plug are quite low, 

with the amphiboles in the Negrais flow showing the lowest value. This may be caused 

by later subsolidus equilibration in the Negrais flow, or correspond to a primary feature, 

with the reactions in amphibole in the Negrais flow taking place at lower temperatures 

than the ones in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug. 

The higher blocking temperatures for the intermediate Montelevar sill and 

basaltic Ribeira d’Ilhas plug are likely a result of faster cooling in these relatively 

thinner intrusives, when compared to the Sines and Monchique igneous complexes and 

even to the LVC’s lava pile. 

In general, most of the blocking temperatures are quite low, which indicates that 

the formation of magnetite from ilmenite probably took place during subsolidus 

oxidation, by exsolution of a previously existing homogenous phase (titanomagnetite), 

which is supported by the observation of trellis lamellae in many of the exsolved 

crystals (e.g. fig. 6.29). 

 

6.2.6 Micas 

 
Brown to reddish micas are present in a small fraction of the analyzed rocks, 

occurring mostly as phenocrysts in one of the lamprophyric Loulé dykes, as an 

accessory phase in the matrix of the Eiras do Faião phonotephritic sill, in the 

Monchique syenites and the Sintra gabbro and even more infrequently in the basaltic 

rocks.  

The structural formula for the analyzed micas was calculated on an 

anhydrous base, with 22 oxygens.  

Most of the analyzed micas are Mg rich phlogopites with the exception of the 

micas in the Monchique nepheline syenite, the two more Fe rich rims in one of the 

phenocrysts in the Loulé lamprophyre, and one crystal in the Eiras do Faião 

phonotephrite and Paço d’Ilhas sills that are classified as biotites.

Fig. 6.32: classification of the mica minerals, according to Rieder et al., (1998). 

 

The crystals in the nepheline syenites usually form a compositionally separate 

group that is more FeO, MnO, K2O and F rich, indicating crystallization from a more 

evolved liquid. Meanwhile, the remaining analyzed crystals formed from more basic 

magmas are enriched in MgO, TiO2, BaO and Na2O (fig. 6.33) relative to the ones 

found in the nepheline syenites.  

Mica compositions in the studied rocks seem to show a tendency for a 

progressive TiO2, Na2O, BaO and Al2O3 decrease and a K2O, and MnO increase with 

decreasing Mg#, i.e. with increasing differentiation (fig. 6.33).

6.2.7 Summary and discussion 

 
From the mineral chemistry data described above, it is possible to make several 

inferences concerning the processes responsible for the evolution and differentiation of 

the alkaline magmas of the WIM. 

Using the geothermometers of Roeder and Emslie (1979) and Beattie (1993), the 

olivine saturation was calculated to have occurred at temperatures between 1250 and 

1150 ºC, for the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug and Negrais lava flow, respectively.  

The precipitation and removal of olivine led to the decrease of Mg and Ni and an 

increase of FeOt in the residual melt, which is reflected in the crystallization sequence 

of the olivines.  

The decreasing amounts of CaO and MnO in the olivines with increasing Fa 

contents are associated to the onset of the crystallization of clinopyroxene, plagioclase 

and possibly Fe-Ti oxides. 

The importance of crystal accumulation processes in the genesis of some of the 

alkaline rocks of the WIM was reinforced by the observation that for some of the 

studied samples (e.g. Sines and Mafra gabbros), their ????/??
??????  value did not reflect 

equilibrium between the composition of the olivines and the rock where they were 

included. Therefore, the whole rock compositions of these occurrences cannot be 

considered as representatives of the liquids from which the olivines precipitated. 

In general, the clinopyroxene compositions evolve towards terms that are more 

enriched in FeO and Na2O, while becoming progressively depleted in MgO. At around 

Mg# &amp;lt;70 the TiO2 and Al2O3 contents of clinopyroxenes start to decrease, probably due 

to decreasing contents in the melt caused by onset of crystallization and removal of 

titanomagnetite and plagioclase. 

Clinopyroxene phenocrysts often show reverse zoning, with the cores possibly 

crystallizing at higher pressures (see fig. 6.18), suggesting the mixture between a more 

evolved and a more basic magma at depth, both of alkaline nature and thus possibly 

genetically related (e.g. Duda and Schminke, 1985; Dobosi, 1989; Dobosi and Fodor, 

1992; Pilet et al., 2002). 

Plagioclase and feldspars predictably evolve from more An rich compositions in 

the more basic rocks to more Ab and Or rich terms in the more siliceous lithologies.  



 

183 
 

The studied plagioclases appear to have crystallized between approximately 

1200º C, for the terms richer in An, and 800 ºC, for the crystals poorer in An (see table 

6.4). However, it must be emphasized that the highest obtained temperatures (Tmax) are 

likely to overestimate the crystallization temperatures for plagioclase since these are 

higher than some of the olivine saturation temperatures and olivine is one of the first 

crystallizing phases in the studied rocks (see 6.1.12). 

Some of the basic porphyritic rocks contain two distinct plagioclase core 

populations in their phenocrysts. One showing higher An contents in the cores than in 

the rims, while the other can show lower amounts of anorthitic in the core molecule 

than its rim and even the matrix phases. 

The most common oxides present in the rocks of the WIM are titanomagnetites 

that coexist with less abundant early chromian spinels (chromites and chromian 

titanomagnetites) as well as ilmenites and magnetites, most of which resulting from the 

exsolution of titanomagnetites.  

The oxygen fugacities and blocking temperatures calculated for the magnetite-

ilmenite pairs in these rocks suggest that in most cases these went through later 

subsolidus equilibration and exsolution at temperatures around 500-650º C. The 

obtained fO2 values point towards conditions close to the NNO and FMQ buffers. These 

data are in accordance with fO2 contemporaneous of the crystallization of chromite in 

the LVC (log fO2 = -8.5 at 1200ºC) as calculated by D’Orey and Palácios (1986). 

The Sintra gabbro shows the more oxidating conditions of all the studied 

occurrences, with fO2 values above the FMQ buffer, which is in agreement with the 

results obtained by Palácios et al. (1995) for this complex. This intrusive complex also 

shows widespread signs for late hydrothermal subsolidus alteration, namely the 

presence of secondary low temperature amphibole, feldspar, chlorite and epidote, which 

might have led the ilmenites and magnetites to reequilibrate under more oxidizing 

conditions. 

The Fe-Ti oxides present in the xenoliths are mostly Fe3+-rich titanomagnetites 

that show a compositional range indicative of crystallization from a relatively evolved 

and oxidized melt. Also, their composition is similar to the one shown in the oxides that 

occur as inclusions in the green cores of clinopyroxenes, pointing to a common origin. 

The amphiboles present in the sampled rocks are mainly Ti rich kaersutites and 

pargasites. They appear as late phases that envelop earlier clinopyroxenes, oxides, 



 

184 
 

apatites and other crystals, as normally or reversely zoned phenocrysts, seldom as 

matrix phases and more rarely as xenocrysts or as a major component in the rare 

xenoliths. 

The equilibrium temperatures for the amphibole-plagioclase pairs in the 

gabbroic and volcanic rocks are between 880 and 1040º C, confirming that this 

equilibrium is achieved relatively late in the crystallization history of these rocks. 

The compositional similarities between the minerals present in the amphibole 

rich xenoliths and as xenocrysts and the ones that constitute the normal crystallization 

products of the analyzed rock suite suggest that in some cases, some of these might 

have formed from a common parental melt (e.g. amphibole megacrysts), while others 

must have derived from a more evolved but compositionally related magma (e.g. green 

cores in the clinopyroxenes). 

The xenoliths can therefore be interpreted as cognate aggregates resulting from 

in depth crystallization from a hydrated, basic to intermediate alkaline magma or 

alternatively, as residues of wall rock assemblages in equilibrium with a similar melt.  

Kaersutite is a common phase both in the xenoliths and xenocrysts. According to 

experimental data, this mineral is stable at depths corresponding to the lithospheric 

mantle (e.g. Irving and Frey, 1984; Pilet et al., 2010) and corresponds to a liquidus 

phase between 21 and 11 kbar (Merril and Wyllie, 1975),  and again at pressures under 

2 kbar in hydrous basic alkaline magmas with low FeOt/TiO2 (Johnson et al., 1989), 

which is equivalent to depths of approximately 70 to 37 km and 7 km, respectively 

(considering an average density of 3000 kg/m3 for the overlying crust and mantle). 

More recently, Irving and Green (2008) proposed that amphibole megacrysts are only 

stable up to 15 kbar (? 50 km) in hydrous basic to intermediate liquids. 

Due to their larger size, monomineralic nature, ubiquitous reaction rims and 

reduced range in composition, showing values comparable to the ones observed in other 

amphibole crystals, it is implied that the kaersutite xenocrysts could represent the 

products of high pressure crystallization of a similar basic, hydrous alkaline melt. They 

precipitated as individual crystals from that melt in the interior of a deep conduit or 

chamber, and did not aggregate into xenoliths. As the magmas ascended and the 

pressure dropped, the volatiles exsolved, and the amphibole xenocrysts became unstable 

and started developing the observed reaction rims, as discussed in section 6.1.12.  



 

185 
 

The existence of reversely zoned clinopyroxenes, amphiboles and plagioclase 

supports the occurrence of magma mixing preceding the installation of the rocks that 

contain them.  

In the case of magmas showing green cored clinopyroxenes, this mixing event 

must have taken place at high depths, as is indicated by the seemingly high pressure 

nature of these cores (fig. 6.18), when a basic magma encountered a more evolved, FeO, 

alkali, and P2O5 enriched melt from which the green cores crystallized. This resulted in 

the homogenization of the different melts and consequential partial resorption of the 

more evolved green clinopyroxenes as well as in the development of more primitive 

(higher Mg#) rims during magma ascension, generating their reverse zoning. The 

quantity of basic, primitive liquid must have been much larger than the more evolved 

melt it mixed with since the resulting liquid is still of ultrabasic to basic nature.  

It is also possible that the observed reversely zoned amphiboles result from the 

same mixing process, since they occur simultaneously with the green cored 

clinopyroxenes in the Malveira da Serra sill, which means that this more evolved 

magma would also be volatile rich.  

The rare reversely zoned plagioclase phenocrysts could also be the product of 

high pressure crystallization and later mixing with a more primitive magma, as was 

suggested for the plagioclase megacrysts found in basic alkaline rocks in Scotland 

(Upton et al., 1999, 2009). 

The existence of high pressure fractionation in the LVC’s magmatic plumbing 

system is also supported by the existence of a high pressure paragenesis in the Suímo 

dyke outcrop consisting of megacrysts of olivine (Fo ? 91), amphibole, garnet (pyrope), 

clino and orthopyroxene and spinel (Palácios, 1985). According to Rankenburg et al. 

(2004) the simultaneous presence of garnet and clinopyroxene with compositions 

similar to the ones observed in this dyke suggests crystallization from a basic melt 

pressures above 21 kbar (? 70 km). There is, however, the possibility that this 

paragenesis might represent xenocrystic material from mantle peridotites. 

Moreover, green cored clinopyroxenes, amphibole megacrysts, and xenoliths are 

often present simultaneously in the outcrops of basic porphyritic rocks from the second 

pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic activity. This suggests that these might be 

crystallization products from the same melt from which the green cored clinopyroxenes 

formed. In this case, the green cores, the evolved amphibole cores and the megacrysts 



 

186 
 

would represent phases crystallizing in the middle of the chamber or conduit, while the 

xenoliths containing minerals with similar compositions could represent cumulus or 

wall rock assemblages previously crystallized from that same magma chamber (fig. 

6.34), similarly to what was proposed by Marchev et al. (2006) for the same type of 

assemblages observed in lamprophyric dykes in the Rhodopes. The absence of olivine 

and plagioclase from those cumulus assemblages could be due to either incomplete 

sampling of the ultramafic xenoliths and/or caused by suppression of plagioclase and 

olivine crystallization in a hydrous magma at high pressure conditions. Such conditions 

greatly reduce the stability of plagioclase, olivine and garnet, leading to enhanced 

crystallization of calcic clinopyroxene and amphibole instead (e.g. Danyushevsky, 

2001; Müntener et al., 2001). 

Such magma chambers are thought to be located at the depth where ascending 

magmas became neutraly buoyant, which can happen in boundaries between layers with 

strong density contrasts, such as the crust-mantle boundary (e.g. Duda and Schmicke, 

1985; Marchev et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2007) or within the lower crust, at depths 

corresponding to the Conrad discontinuity (e.g. Duda and Schmicke, 1985; Sachs and 

Hansteen, 2000). Magmas stagnated at such depth could then start to crystallize and 

evolve, generating the xenoliths by accumulation of crystals fractionated from a basic 

melt and later the green pyroxenes from a more evolved liquid that resulted from the 

fractionation and removal of the phases present in the xenoliths.  

This evolved magma could correspond to the differentiation product of a liquid 

generated during an earlier pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. Both the WIM and 

many other continental intraplate locations where reversely zoned clinopyroxene and 

amphibole phenocrysts occur along with amphibole clinopiroxenite xenoliths seem to 

have experienced several pulses of basic alkaline activity previous to the emplacement 

or extrusion of the rocks that contain the reversely zoned crystals and xenoliths (e.g. 

Cantal lavas in the Massif Central, Pilet et al., 2002; magmatism in the Panonian Basin, 

Dobosi, 1989, Dobosi and Jenner, 1999; West Eiffel, Duda and Schmincke, 1985; 

Hocheifeld, Jung et al., 2006). It is thus suggested that the parental liquids from which 

the xenoliths and xenocrysts formed correspond to magmas from the earlier pulses of 

alkaline activity that stagnated at high depths, probably due to unfavorable stress fields 

that limited the propagation of conduits to the surface.

Fig. 6.34: Schematic representation of a possible mechanism for the formation of the reversely zoned 

crystals and xenoliths. Initial magma accumulation (first magma pulse) in a magma chamber at high 

depth starts to fractionate and evolve. When a second pulse of more basic magma passes through the 

chamber it remobilizes accumulated crystals (xenoliths) and isolated crystals that are suspended in an 

evolved melt. These crystals will react with the basic melt and develop rims that are more primitive than 

their cores, thus generating the reversely zoned crystals. Adapted from Duda and Schminke (1985). 

 

A phonotephritic to tephrophonolitic liquid has been identified in glass 

inclusions found in green clinopyroxenes, titanite and Fe-Ti oxides in clinopyroxenite 

xenoliths (Sachs and Hansteen, 2000) that are similar to the ones found in the Late 



 

188 
 

Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM and has been interpret as the parental liquid from 

which those xenoliths formed. 

The mixing and homogenization of a basic, primitive magma with small portions 

of a more evolved, volatile rich liquid would lead to the formation of melt that retains 

its basic nature but suffered a small reduction in density and an increase in volatile 

content when compared with the original basic liquid. This could result in the 

pressurization of the system, leading to rapid ascension and installation of the magmas.  

A volatile rich magma also has the potential to exsolve those volatiles during 

ascension and decompression, generating explosive eruptions such as the ones that 

happened before every effusive phase in the LVC, resulting in the formation of the 

pyroclastic deposits. 

It is therefore suggested that the mixing of basic alkaline magmas with more 

evolved magmas of alkaline nature at depth could have been an important factor leading 

to the ascension and eruption of some of the basic alkaline magmas of the WIM. 

It should be noted that some authors proposed that the xenoliths and xenocrysts 

containing green clinopyroxene and amphibole with composition similar to the ones 

present in the analyzed rocks are in fact part of disaggregated metasomatic veins present 

within the lithospheric mantle that formed as a result of the action of siliceous, volatile 

rich (CO2 and H2O) mantle melts (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005, 2008; Niu, 2008; Irving and 

Green, 2008; Upton et al., 2009). These melts can correspond to liquids with a basanite 

to hawaiite composition and other products of their differentiation (Irving and Green, 

2008; Pilet et al., 2010), previously generated from very low amounts of partial fusion 

of slightly enriched peridotites in the asthenosphere (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005, 2008; Niu, 

2008). They would precipitate clinopyroxene and amphibole rich assemblages by 

percolative fractional crystallization (Pilet et al., 2005, 2010; Irving and Green, 2008) 

while advancing through the lithospheric mantle.  

The occurrence of apatite associated with amphibole in xenoliths and as 

xenocrysts, similarly to what is observed in the alkaline rocks of the WIM, has also 

been interpreted as the result of in depth crystallization of alkaline silicic carbonated 

magmas (e.g. O’Reilly and Griffin, 2000), however, the determination of the chemical 

composition of apatite is necessary in order to confirm this hypothesis. 

According to Pilet et al. (2008) the melting of these metasomatic hornblendite to 

pyroxenite veins along with variable amounts of surrounding peridotite can generate 



 

189 
 

liquids with a compositional array ranging from nephelinite to alkali basalt with 

variably enriched geochemical signatures. However, it is not possible to unequivocally 

determine whether these metasomatic amphibole bearing veins are a precursor or a 

consequence of alkaline magmatism (Pilet et al., 2010).  

Considering the arguments presented above, the xenocrysts and xenoliths 

observed in the studied rocks of the WIM could be interpreted as being part of the 

mantle assemblage that melted in order to generate the alkaline magmatism that took 

place in the Late Cretaceous in the WIM, or be the result of crystallization and 

accumulation processes that occurred at depth during earlier phases of alkaline 

magmatism. Yet, in order to properly evaluate these hypothesis, additional detailed 

mineral chemistry studies are necessary, including the determination of trace element 

and isotopic composition of individual mineral phases that occur simultaneously as 

xenoliths, xenocrysts and as normally zoned phenocrysts and matrix phases.

7. Geochemistry and petrogenesis 
 

In this chapter the main elementar and isotopic characteristics of the studied Late 

Cretaceous alkaline rocks and their genetic implications are discussed. 

The samples were prepared for analysis at the Departamento de Geologia da 

Universidade de Lisboa. They were hydraulically crushed, in order to ensure the 

removal of all the signs of alteration, then reduced in size using a jaw crusher and 

afterwards powdered in an agate swing mill. 

Concentrations for major and trace elements were obtained at Actlabs Ancaster, 

Ontario, Canada. Major elements were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma 

Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) after alkaline dissolution with lithium 

metaborate/tetraborate followed by nitric acid dissolution (except for Ni, Cu and Zn 

measurements that were performed after acid digestion). 

Samples were prepared and analyzed in a batch system.  Each batch contained a 

method reagent blank, certified reference material and 17% replicates. Samples were 

mixed with a flux of lithium metaborate and lithium tetraborate and fused in an 

induction furnace. The melt was immediately poured into a solution of 5% nitric acid 

containing an internal standard and mixed continuously until completely dissolved (? 30 

minutes). 

The fused sample was diluted and analyzed by Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 6000, 

6100 or 9000 ICP-MS. Three blanks and five controls (three before sample group and 

two after) were analyzed per group of samples.  Duplicates were fused and analyzed 

every 15 samples.  The instrument was recalibrated every 40 samples. Calibration was 

performed using seven prepared USGS and CANMET certified reference materials. 

One of the seven standards was used during the analysis for every group of ten samples. 

The prepared sample solution was spiked with internal standards to cover the entire 

mass range. 

The calculated reproducibility is ? 1 relative % for major elements and ? 5  

relative % for trace, rare earth elements (REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE). 

The accuracy of the analyses, evaluated by analyzing international standards, is 

generally better than 10 relative-%. More information on the procedure, precision and 

accuracy of the Actlabs analyses can be found at http://www.actlabs.com.

7.1. Major and trace element geochemistry 

The distinction between major and trace elements is based on fundamental 

differences in geochemical behavior. A “major” element is an essential constituent of 

the minerals making up a rock and changing the concentrations of these elements can 

lead to changes in the phase assemblage. Typically, these are expressed under oxide 

form and are: SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, MnO, FeO, CaO, Na2O, K2O and also Cr2O3, and NiO 

for mantle rocks. The major elements in magmas are by definition compatible, and most 

of them are well buffered by the residual minerals. 

Trace elements, on the other hand, replace a few atoms of the major elements in 

the crystal structures, without affecting the phase assemblage significantly, so their 

abundances are usually lower than 0.01% or 1000 part per million (ppm). They are 

accessory in many petrogenetic processes, and they are therefore useful as tracers of 

such processes. During solid-phase transformations, they will redistribute themselves 

locally between the newly formed mineral phases but, during melting or magmatic 

evolution, they are partitioned to a greater or lesser degree into the melt. Thus trace 

element signatures of magmatic rocks carry information about the composition of the 

source and the nature of their melting and evolution processes.  

The partitioning of trace elements between crystalline and liquid phases is 

usually described by a partition coefficient D, which is a simple ratio of two 

concentrations at chemical equilibrium: 

?? =  
???

??
? 

 

where ??  is the partition coefficient of trace element i, ???  and ??
? are the concentrations 

(by weight) of this element in the solid and liquid phases, respectively. 

Goldschmidt (1954) recognized that the distribution of trace elements in 

minerals is strongly controlled by ionic radius and charge. The partition coefficient of a 

given trace element between solid and melt can be quantitatively described by the 

elastic strain this element causes by its presence in the crystal lattice. When this strain is 

large because of the large differences in sizes between lattice space and ionic radius, the 

partition coefficient becomes small, and the element is partitioned into the liquid.  



 

192 
 

Many trace elements have values of D &amp;lt;1, because they differ substantially 

either in ionic radius and/or charge, from the atoms of the major elements they should 

replace in the crystal lattice and as a consequence remain in the melt. Due to this, they 

are called incompatible. In opposition, trace elements such as Sr in plagioclase, Ni in 

olivine, and Sc in clinopyroxene fit into their host crystal structures, therefore being 

compatible for those specific minerals, becoming useful in detecting processes where 

the fractionation of these phases is involved.  

Incompatible trace elements are often divided into two major groups, according 

to ionic radius and charge, which define their field strenght. High Field Strength 

elements (HFSE) are small cations with high ionic charges (e.g. Zr, Hf, Th, Nb, Ta, U, 

and the Rare Earth Elements (REE) or lanthanides), and are not easily incorporated in 

the more common silicate minerals. 

Large Ion Lithophile elements (LILE) such as Cs, Rb, K, Ba, Sr, have larger 

ionic radiuses and lower ionic potential, and have a tendency to be more compatible in 

some minerals. They are also more easily mobilized by hydrous fluids, being more 

mobile in alteration and metassomatic processes than HFSE.  

Trace elements with very low partition coefficients may vary by three orders of 

magnitude in the melt, depending on the degree of melting of the source. The 

concentration of such elements is inversely proportional to the melt fraction F, because 

the melt contains, essentially, the entire budget of this trace element and if there is a 

larger amount of melt available, the concentration of trace elements will become more 

“diluted”. Another consequence of highly incompatible behavior of trace elements is 

that if the mineral in the source that contains most of the chemical budget for a certain 

element (e.g. Zr in zircon) is exhausted during melting, their concentration ratios in the 

melt become constant, independently of melt fraction, and will be identical to the 

respective ratio in the mantle source.  

 

7.1.1. Classification and Major element geochemistry 

 

After recalculation to 100% on a volatile free basis, all of the sampled rocks, 

even the ones with cumulate textures, fall within the alkaline field in the TAS (Total 

Alkalis versus Silica, fig. 7.1), considering the compositional division between the 

alkaline and sub-alkaline series defined by MacDonald (1968). 



 

193 
 

Both extrusive and intrusive rocks are plotted in the TAS diagram, as well as in 

the other graphs used to characterize the geochemistry and evaluate the compositional 

evolution of the studied samples. This was done in order to allow a comparison between 

the basic alkaline extrusive and intrusive occurrences and to try and distinguish any 

significant variation between them. The number of studied complexes within a 

relatively large area advises some caution when interpreting these diagrams since it is 

not realistic to assume that all the rocks are cogenetic and have evolved in identical 

ways, even if, in some cases, their age and possibly even parental magmas might be 

similar. 

The samples from the ultrabasic (SiO2 &amp;lt;45%) Foz da Fonte sill classify as 

tephrites since olivine does not occur in this rock.  

The Paço d’Ilhas sill is not so straightforwardly classified due to its layered 

nature, with its samples showing a considerable compositional range. The basic samples 

(45 &amp;lt;SiO2 &amp;lt;52 %), that represent layers where more mafic minerals have accumulated, 

fall within the basalt field. However, the more evolved of the intermediate (52 &amp;lt;SiO2 &amp;lt;

63 %, Na2O-2  &gt; K2O) layers plot well into the benmoreite field and correspond to the 

more evolved samples in the dataset. The mesocratic layers that constitute most of the 

sill actually plot in the mugearite field. 

The studied flows and necks from the LVC are ultrabasic to basic rocks that 

classify as basanites (Ol &gt; 10 %) and alkali basalts (Lexim neck), with the plugs also 

falling on the basanite field. The sills integrated in this complex show more evolved 

compositions, ranging from hawaiites (Lomba dos Pianos) to mugearites (Montelevar 

and Anços), benmoreites (Anços). The Eiras do Faião sill shows a distinct, more 

alkali.rich and SiO2 undersaturated, phonotephritic composition, unlike the other nearby 

sills that are also included in the LVC. 

The three different dykes from the Cascais region plot in different fields of the 

TAS diagram. The porphyritic basalt from Bafureira beach falls within the alkaline 

basalt field, the dyke that outcrops in the Parede beach can be classified as a tephrite 

and the one collected in Poça beach plots in the hawaiite field. 

The Malveira da Serra sill is also classified as a tephrite since it lacks olivine. 

The two sampled Loulé dykes are both ultrabasic lamprophyric rocks and plot in 

the foidite field, but the monchiquite C-20 shows a much higher amount of alkalis than 

the olivine phyric C-12-1.

Fig. 7.1: Total Alkalis versus Silica diagram for the studied samples, after LeBas et al. (1986). Line 

dividing the alkaline and sub-alkaline series from MacDonald (1968). 
 

Most of the samples from the Fontanelas seamount are very altered, and contain 

a high amount of vesicles filled with secondary alteration products (sometimes over 

40% of the volume of the sample). Although they were subject to leaching in 1.5N HCl 

before being sent out for analysis, their Loss On Ignition (LOI) values were still very 

high (6.5-10%), so caution must be taken while trying to classify them and interpreting 

their whole rock geochemical data. The lavas from this seamount are mostly ultrabasic 

rocks and fall in the foidite field, except for one sample that plots on the alkali basalt 

field. They are all alkaline but it is possible that their total alkalis content is not 



 

195 
 

representative of its original value due to alkali removal or addition during alteration. 

The high degree of alteration of the samples does not allow further classification of the 

foidites as nephelinites or leucitites. 

As for the granular rocks represented in fig. 7.1, the gabbroic plug present in 

Mafra falls on the basanite/tephrite field, alongside a lot of samples from the LVC, 

Sintra, Sines, Monchique and the Foz da Fonte sill. 

The basic intrusive rocks from Sintra plot on the basanite/tephrite fields as well, 

with the diorite being slightly more evolved and falling in the hawaiite field.  

In its turn, the mafic intrusives from Sines show larger scatter in the TAS 

diagram. The ultrabasic rocks from the Pedras Negras outcrop plot on the picrobasalt 

field, reinforcing the idea introduced in section 6.1 that these are in fact products of 

accumulation processes. One of the samples from the amphibole rich gabbro from the 

southern gabbro outcrops plots on the basanite/tephrite field near the Sintra gabbros, 

while the other sample from the same outcrop and the diorite fall in the more evolved 

hawaiite field, with the diorite being the more silica rich rock in this group. 

Compared with the basic rocks from other intrusive complexes, the mafic rocks 

from Monchique are more alkali rich for a given SiO2 content. On the TAS diagram one 

sample is ultrabasic and plots near one of the Loulé samples on the foidite field, 

although it is even more SiO2 poor. The other samples fall in the basanite/tephrite field 

with the more SiO2 rich one even plotting on the phonotephritic field. 

 

Another feature evident in the TAS diagram is the existence of two different 

magmatic evolution trends. One progresses towards silica oversaturared compositions 

and is clearly more important, as it includes most of the analyzed samples as well as 

other rocks of the same age that were not sampled in this study (e.g. Sintra granite and 

syenite, Sines syenite, rhyolites from the LVC). This trend illustrates evolution from a 

silica undersaturated basanitic parent towards silica saturation, originating the 

benmoreites of the Anços sill and eventually culminating in rocks of rhyolitic or granitic 

composition (not shown, see Palácios, 1985, and Matos Alves, 1964).  

The other trend is SiO2 undersaturated and it also departs from a possible 

basanitic parent but progresses towards silica undersaturated compositions represented 

by the tephriphonolites of the Monchique complex and of the Eiras do Faião sill, 

culminating in the nepheline syenites (not shown) that form the larger part of the 

Monchique igneous complex (e.g. Valadares, 2004). 



 

196 
 

Looking at a broader context, the trend towards silica oversaturated 

compositions seems to dominate in the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of the 

WIM, being common to the LVC (Palácios, 1985), the Sintra igneous complex where 

the granites and syenites make up most of the outcropping area (e.g. Matos Alves, 

1964), the Sines igneous complex where quartz bearing syenites are found (e.g. 

Canilho, 1972) and even some of the seamounts that constitute the MTR contain SiO2 

saturated rocks (Merle et al., 2006).  

Most of the samples integrate the potassic series defined by Middlemost (1975) 

for basic alkali rocks, although all the basic samples of the Sintra igneous complex, the 

amphibole rich gabbros in the Sines complex, a few samples from the LVC and one 

from Paço d’Ilhas all plot in the sodic series field (fig. 7.2). However, their positioning 

in the sodic series can be due to the accumulation of Na-rich phases such as plagioclase 

or amphibole. 

 

 
Fig. 7.2: Classification diagram for the alkaline basalt series after Middlemost (1975). 

 

Only one sample from the Fontanelas seamount (AT692E) falls in the highly 

potassic series field, but the higher potassium content in this sample might be due to 



 

197 
 

secondary addition of K during alteration. K addition from seawater has already been 

reported in submarine basalts from the MTR (Merle et al., 2009) meaning that a similar 

process is behind the high K in the Fontanelas seamount. 

The Mg# [Mg# = 100 x (MgO/(MgO+FeO)), with FeO being calculated  

according to the Fe2O3/FeO ratios recommended by Middlemost (1989)] for these rocks 

varies between 70.2 for dyke C-12-1 in Loulé and 34.7 one of the felsic layers in the 

Paço d’Ilhas sill, averaging  at 54  in the basic  and  ultrabasic rocks (SiO2 &amp;lt;52%),  

which  is somewhat lower than expected for basic and ultrabasic alkaline igneous rocks. 

This suggests that these magmas have undergone significant fractional crystallization in 

a deeper, unexposed part of the magmatic plumbing system before eruption or 

emplacement. 

Major elements are plotted against SiO2 in figure 7.3, with SiO2 being used as an 

indicator of magmatic differentiation. 

Owing to their relatively wide geographical (e.g. figs. 4.1, 4.2) and 

chronological (94-72 Ma, see section 5) distribution, as well as diverse modes of 

occurrence, the studied rocks cannot be considered cogenetic. In this perspective, the 

binary plots presented from here onwards and containing all of the studied samples are 

only used as tool to identify possible common processes affecting the evolution of these 

rocks and emphasize similarities or differences detected between each of the different 

occurrences. 

In the studied rocks, MgO, FeO, TiO2 and CaO all decrease with increasing SiO2 

contents, while Al2O3, Na2O and K2O increase. P2O5 shows very scattered concentration 

values that seem to be characterized by an initial increase, followed by a significant 

decrease for SiO2 &gt; 45%, which can be interpreted as resulting from apatite 

fractionation.  

Some deviations from the apparent trends are probably the consequence of the 

already discussed crystal accumulation processes. These can justify the higher MgO in 

some of the Sines gabbros, as well as in the porphyritic basalts of LVC’s flows and 

necks and in the case of the porphyritic dykes from Cascais due to olivine accumulation 

(fig. 7.3). The high FeOT and TiO2 values found in the more basic samples in the Paço 

d’Ilhas sill (fig. 7.3) can also be attributed to the accumulation of Fe rich mafic minerals 

such as Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxene in the mafic layers. 



 

198 
 

 
Fig. 7.3: Plots of selected major elements versus SiO2 content for the analyzed samples. Legend as in 

figs. 7.1 and 7.2. 



 

199 
 

Al2O3 also shows some spread (fig. 7.3), with a few samples from the basic 

rocks in Sintra and from the Vasco da Gama beach in Sines being more enriched in Al 

than other rocks with the same SiO2 content. On the other hand, the samples from 

Pedras Negras in Sines, the mafic layers from the Paço d’Ilhas sill and the porphyritic 

basaltic dyke from Cascais show lower than expected Al contents. These opposite 

behaviors of the same element, sometimes in the same intrusive (Sines) are probably 

due to plagioclase removal during fractional crystallization creating the Al2O3 deficit in 

some samples (Pedras Negras gabbro in Sines, mafic layers in Paço d’Ilhas) while its 

accumulation led to Al2O3 excess in other samples (Azóia and Praia Vasco da Gama 

gabbros in Sintra and Sines, respectively). 

CaO seems to decrease with increasing SiO2 (fig. 7.3). However, the high CaO 

values in the samples from the Fontanelas seamount can be related to secondary 

alteration processes that added carbonate, and consequently CaO to these rocks. 

The scatter observed in the plots of Na2O, K2O and P2O5 against SiO2 (fig. 7.3) 

might be caused by either to fractionation and accumulation processes, or due to 

differences in source composition that originated magmas which could possess different 

concentrations of Na, K and P. Also, crustal contamination processes can influence the 

amount of alkalies present in the melt since these elements can be very abundant in 

crustal rocks. The importance of the contamination processes will be discussed in 

section 7.3.2  

Samples that carry feldspathoids (basic rocks from Monchique, Eiras do Faião 

sill, Loulé dykes) usually have higher alkali contents and often correspond to the 

highest K2O and Na2O contents for a given SiO2 value observed in the diagrams. 

Plagioclase and feldspar accumulation in the gabbroic rocks can produce similar effects, 

with their removal causing the lower K2O and Na2O contents observed in the mafic 

cumulates such as the Pedras Negras gabbro in Sines and the mafic layers in the Paço 

d’Ilhas sill.  

As for P2O5, samples such as the Sintra, Monchique and the Sines Vasco da 

Gama beach gabbros clearly show signals of apatite accumulation, which justifies the 

high P2O5 contents in these rocks. The low contents of P2O5 in the Pedras Negras 

gabbro in Sines seem, again, to be due to accumulation of P poor phases like olivine and 

clinopyroxene. 

In more general terms, the decrease in MgO, FeO and TiO2 can explained by the 

crystallization and removal of mafic minerals such as olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti 



 

200 
 

oxides and amphibole. Clinopyroxene and amphibole also incorporate significant CaO 

and their removal, coupled with CaO rich plagioclase, can also explain the decrease in 

this oxide with increasing silica contents. 

Al2O3 clearly increases up to values around 55% SiO2 and from then onwards 

seems to show a slight decrease with increasing SiO2, probably due to the removal of 

crystallizing plagioclase 

The generalized increase in Na2O, K2O, and SiO2 can be justified by the relative 

enrichment in these elements caused by removal of MgO, FeO, TiO2, CaO and even 

Al2O3 by crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxides. None 

of those minerals is particularly rich in those elements so their fractionation does not 

contribute to the decrease of their concentrations in the residual liquids. 

 

 
Fig. 7.4: Plots Al2O3/CaO and Al2O3/TiO2 versus SiO2 content for the analyzed samples. 

 

The Al2O3/CaO ratio increases from nearly chondritic towards supercondritic 

values (chondrites ? 1.23, Palme and O’Neill, 2003) with increasing silica contents, 

which argues for the importance of clinopyroxene and plagioclase removal on the 

evolution of the magmatic liquids since these remove show low Al2O3/CaO. 

In their turn, the Al2O3/TiO2 ratios (fig. 7.4) are lower than the ones found in 

chondrites (18.5-22.4, Palme and O’Neill, 2003), meaning that these magmas are 
enriched in Ti relative to a primordial source. Also, as seen on fig. 7.4, this ratio 

increases with increasing differentiation. That is a consequence of crystallization and 

removal of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxene that remove TiO2 from the liquid, 

confirming the importance of the fractionation of these minerals in the evolution of 



 

201 
 

these magmas. Crystal accumulation seems to be responsible for some deviations from 

the general trend observed by the samples from Sines, Sintra and Paço d’Ilhas.  

 

7.1.2. Trace element geochemistry 

As was mentioned before, certain trace elements see their concentrations 

decrease with progressive crystallization and removal of minerals. These elements 

possess ionic radius and valence similar to the more abundant major elements and can 

therefore substitute these major elements and integrate the crystal structure of some 

specific mineral(s). They are referred to as compatible trace elements and show D &gt; 1 

for the phases in which they are compatible (table 7.1).

to the data available on GERM database (www.earthref.org, Matsui et al., 1977; Takashi, 1978; Okamoto, 

1979; Villemant et al., 1981; Lemarchand et al., 1987; Nielsen, 1992; Beattie, 1994; Latourrette et al., 

1995;  Esperanza et al., 1997; Zack and Brumm, 1998; Bindeman et al., 1998; Green et al., 2000; Adam 

and Green, 2006).

Within the analyzed samples, compatible trace element correspond to Ni, Cr, V, 

Sc and to a lesser degree, Sr. The variation in their concentrations will be caused mostly 

by the precipitation and removal of minerals identified as phenocryst phases (see section 

6.2) such as olivine (Ni), clinopyroxene (Cr, V, Sc, Ni) , Fe-Ti oxides (V, Sc, Ni, Cr), 

plagioclase (Sr) and others, but one cannot discard source heterogeneity as a possible 

cause of diversity in the observed concentrations for these elements. They are plotted 

against Mg# instead of SiO2 in fig. 7.5 since this index allows for a relative expansion 

of the X axis values in what respects basic rocks, facilitating the detection of early 

processes that involve the crystallization of mafic minerals which accommodate some 

of these compatible elements. 



 

202 
 

 
Fig. 7.5: Plots of selected compatible trace elements versus Mg# for the analyzed samples. Given that the 

plotted samples are not cogenetic, the drawn lines are simply indicative of what may be interpreted as a 

general evolutionary tendency of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas. 



 

203 
 

Ni is strongly compatible in olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides and is often 

used as an indicator for olivine fractionation since this is usually the more abbundant 

early crystallizing phase in basic alkaline magmas (tab. 7.1). As is observed in fig. 7.5, 

the Ni contents are usually low, rarely surpassing 200 ppm, and decrease very rapidly 

with decreasing Mg#, pointing towards early removal of olivine. The samples from the 

Fontanelas seamount are an exception to this case, as they show Ni contents up to 314 

ppm. 

Cr is also strongly compatible in clinopyroxene, amphibole and especially spinel 

(tab. 7.1), and shows a behavior similar to Ni, decreasing quickly with decreasing Mg# 

(fig. 7.5), also arguing for the early removal of these phases. Again, the lavas from the 

Fontanelas seamount are the samples with the highest Cr contents. 

It is noticeable that none of the analyzed samples fit the criteria that define 

primary magmas (i. e. magmas which are products of mantle melting and have not been 

modified by fractional crystallization or interaction with country rock during ascension, 

and are characterized by: Mg# &gt; 68, Ni &gt; 320 ppm, Cr &gt; 1000 ppm, e.g. Frey et al., 

1978), implying that, as was previously proposed, these magmas must have undergone 

important spinel, olivine and probably clinopyroxene fractionation in depth prior to 

eruption or installation.   

V is very compatible in Fe-Ti oxides such as magnetite and ilmenite and slightly 

less so in clinopyroxene and amphibole (tab. 7.1). In fig. 7.5, V also shows a negative 

correlation with decreasing Mg for values lower than 55 Mg#, as a consequence of the 

removal of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopyroxenes from then onwards. For Mg# values higher 

than 55 the samples show more or less scattered but relatively stable V values, 

reflecting either source heterogeneity or accumulation. The previously discussed mafic 

cumulate layers of the Paço d’Ilhas sill, and Sines Pedras Negras gabbro show higher V 

values than samples with similar Mg# due to their cumulate nature, while other samples 

from the basic rocks in Monchique or the Fontanelas seamounts might show higher V 

abundances due to source enrichment since they do not show any clear petrographic 

signs of crystal accumulation.  

Sc is mainly compatible in clinopyroxene and also with magnetite and 

amphibole. It shows a negative correlation with decreasing Mg# arguing for an 

important role for early clinopyroxene and magnetite removal in the evolution of the 

alkaline series. The same samples that fell out of the main trend in the V vs. Mg# 

diagram also plot out of the main trend here, due to the same processes of accumulation 



 

204 
 

(Paço d’Ilhas, Sines). The positioning of the less evolved samples from Monchique and 

Fontanelas probably reflects their origin from a distinct source or from a similar source 

that was affected by lower degrees of partial melting. 

Sr is only compatible in plagioclase and its concentration in the melt should 

lower with the progressive crystallization and removal of this mineral. Plotted against 

Mg# the Sr concentrations seem to increase until Mg# ? 50 and start to decrease from 

then onwards, marking the initiation of removal of plagioclase from the system. The 

samples from the Fontanelas seamount show homogeneously low Sr values for all 

samples, due to either removal of this mobile element during seawater alteration, or 

during the leaching that these samples were subject to prior to analysis. Some samples 

from Monchique and Loulé show unusually high Sr values probably due to being 

derived from a more Sr enriched source or even due to resulting from lower degrees of 

partial melting of a source similar to the other basic alkaline rocks. 

 

 
Fig. 7.6: Plots of CaO/Al2O3 vs. Sc for and TiO2 vs. V for the analyzed samples. Legend as in fig. 7.5. 

 

The strong correlation between the TiO2 and V contents of the studied rocks 

confirms the importance of Ti-rich clinopyroxene and especially Fe-Ti oxides (up to 5% 

V2O3 and 54% TiO2, see annex IV) in controlling the distribution of these elements. 

Sc and the CaO/Al2O3 ratio also show a strong correlation, arguing that these 

values are both controlled by the crystallization of clinopyroxene. Samples from the 

Fontanelas seamount show higher CaO/Al2O3 values probably due to secondary CaO 



 

205 
 

addition during alteration, while the rocks from Monchique and Loulé seem to be 

enriched in CaO. 

 

Whenever trace elements possess ionic radius or valences that do not allow them 

to integrate the structures of the more common minerals crystallizing from a silicate 

magma, their concentration in the residual liquid will tend to increase with 

differentiation. These are known as incompatible trace elements.  

7.1.2.1  Primitive mantle normalized multielemental diagrams  

Primitive mantle normalized multielemental diagrams, or spider diagrams, are a 

quick way to visualize and characterize the abundance and variation of incompatible 

trace elements in igneous rocks. They allow for the display of many elements, whose 

concentration is normalized to a primitive mantle composition (Palme and O’Neill, 

2003), facilitating the detection of relative enrichments and/or depletions in relation to 

this composition. For the discussion of trace element signatures it is important to remind 

that the trace element contents of plutonic rocks may not be the best representatives of 

the compositions of their parental melts due to the likely occurrence of crystal removal 

and accumulation processes which may modify these signatures, although some of their 

original compositional features can still be distinguishable.  

Given that geochronological data allowed the identification of two separate 

pulses of magmatism within the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism (Miranda et al., 

2009, see section 5), and since changes in incompatible trace element concentrations 

can be a useful tool in detecting differences between magmas of similar composition, 

the samples from both groups will be presented separately when appropriate.  

Below, the primitive mantle normalized spider diagrams and chondrite (Palme 

and O’Neill, 2003) normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) diagrams for individual or 

groups of major occurrences are represented and will be discussed separately (figs. 7.7 

and 7.8), in order to facilitate the interpretation of the obtained results.  

In general, all samples belonging to the second and more recent pulse of alkaline 

activity in the WIM (75-72 Ma, Miranda et al., 2009, this study) are incompatible 

element enriched and in most cases, the more basic samples show negative K, P, Hf and 

Zr anomalies. 

In the south, the 72 Ma Loulé dykes and basic rocks from the Monchique 

igneous complex show similar patterns, with negative anomalies in K, Zr, Hf and 

sometimes even Ti and P (fig. 7.7).  



 

206 
 

 

 
Fig. 7.7: Primitive upper mantle normalized (Palme and O’Neill, 2003)  multielemental plots for the 

rocks of the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline igneous activity (75-72 Ma). 

 

In the Sines igneous complex, the basic rocks are not as enriched as in 

Monchique. The cumulate nature of the Pedras Negras gabbro is reflected on their trace 

element abundance patterns, with these being the least trace element enriched samples, 

which also show a small positive Ti anomaly due to the accumulation of Fe-Ti oxides 

and Clinopyroxene. Otherwise, they show the same negative K, P, Zr and Hf anomalies 

as observed in the basic rocks from Monchique. 



 

207 
 

The Vasco da Gama beach amphibole rich gabbros are more trace element 

enriched and display more pronounced K, Hf and Zr negative anomalies and are missing 

the negative P anomaly probably due to accumulation of apatite. Also, they show a 

small negative Ti anomaly that might be consequence of the accumulation of Ti rich 

phases in the Pedras Negras gabbro. The higher incompatible element abundances in 

this gabbro supports the view that these samples represent a higher part of the magma 

chamber where the residual, more evolved liquid resulting from the progressive removal 

of mafic minerals to form cumulates such as the Pedras Negras gabbro gathered. 

The spidergram for the Sines diorite shows a smoother patern with less 

pronounced or inexistent negative anomalies in K, Zr, Hf and Ti but with small negative 

anomalies in Sr and P, probably due to the removal of plagioclase and apatite, 

respectively. 

The basic rocks from the Sintra igneous complex show trace element 

abundances and patterns similar to the ones observed in the Sintra and Sines complexes, 

with negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies, sometimes also showing negative Ti as well. P 

can show a positive anomaly due to the accumulation of apatite in some of these rocks. 

The gabbros from the Peninha outcrop show more enriched signatures and 

negative Ti and positive P anomalies, while the ones from the Azóia outcrop show the 

opposite behavior, i.e. positive Ti and negative P anomalies. This suggests that these 

gabbroic outcrops represent different zones in the magma chamber. In this perspective, 

the Azóia gabbros could correspond to a deeper level where Ti rich oxides accumulated 

and the Peninha gabbro to a higher level of the same chamber where the residual, Ti 

depleted and incompatible element enriched liquid accumulated. 

The diorite shows a pattern with an enrichment level intermediate between both 

the gabbro outcrops. 

The Malveira da Serra sill is plotted with the basic rocks from the Sintra 

complex since some authors proposed that it might be a precursor of the installation of 

this complex (e.g. Kullberg and Kullberg, 2000). It shows a similar spidergram to these 

and other Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks, but with smaller K, Zr and Hf negative 

anomalies and with a small Sr negative anomaly. 

 Necks, flows and plugs from the LVC and Cascais dykes all show similar 

incompatible element patterns between themselves and with the same pronounced 

negative K anomalies but with smaller P, Zr and Hf anomalies. One of the Cascais 

dykes shows a positive P anomaly, as a result of the abundance of apatite in the sample. 



 

208 
 

Ti varies between having no anomaly and showing small negative or positive 

anomalies, probably due to the removal or accumulation of Fe-Ti oxides and 

Clinopyroxene. 

The sills associated with the LVC and the Sintra igneous complex have basic 

(Lomba dos Pianos, Malveira da Serra) to more evolved (Eiras do Faião, Montelevar, 

Anços) compositions and show incompatible trace element patterns that reflect the 

processes responsible for that evolution. 

The phonotephritic Eiras do Faião sill shows the more enriched character of all 

the sills, where the same negative K, P, Zr and Hf anomalies seen in the more basic 

rocks are observed, as well as a pronounced negative Ti anomaly probably caused by 

the removal of Fe-Ti oxides and Clinopyroxenes . 

The intermediate Anços and Montelevar sills show similar spidergrams, with 

absent or very small negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies, while having pronounced 

negative Ti and P anomalies due to the removal of Fe-Ti oxides and Clinopyroxenes, 

and apatite. 

The basic Lomba dos Pianos sill show spidergrams more similar to the other 

basic rocks in the province, with small negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies and but is 

distinguished by a positive Sr anomaly probably due to the abbundance of plagioclase 

phenocrysts in the sill. 

Incompatible trace element patterns for the Fontanelas seamount have slightly 

different trace element patterns than the onshore basic samples. All of the samples show 

a pronounced negative, K and Sr anomalies. The Sr anomaly was probably caused by 

the Sr removal during the replacement of plagioclase in the matrix by secondary 

alteration products. These alteration products might have kept some of the Sr but were 

totally or partially removed during the leaching with HCl these samples were subject to 

prior to analysis. The K anomaly is common to all of the Late Cretaceous rocks and 

might be related to retention in the source, but there is also the possibility that it might 

have been enhanced by the alteration and/or leaching, as was previously discussed for 

Sr. Only one sample from Fontanelas shows a negative Zr and Hf anomaly and another 

one shows a spike in P, probably due to the important occurrence of apatite in 

inclusions in amphibole. 

Considering the uncontaminated nature of these basic and ultrabasic magmas 

(further developed in section 7.3.2), demonstrated by the absence of Ta and Nb troughs, 

and considering that the crystallization and removal of phases that might cause the 



 

209 
 

depletion of these incompatible trace elements did not occur, these negative anomalies 

are likely to be caused by retention of these elements in residual mantle phases.  

The residual phases responsible for the retention and consequent negative 

anomalies on the multielemental diagrams of rocks from the second pulse of alkaline 

magmatic activity might have formed during a metasomatic episode and correspond to 

K-rich amphibole or phlogopite, for K (e.g. Class and Goldstein, 1997), apatite in the 

case of P (e.g. O’Reilly and Griffin, 2000), and eventually baddeleyite or zircon for Zr 

and Hf (Andronikov and Foley, 2002; Kerr et al., 2010). These phases would either 

remain as a part of the mantle source during the small degree of partial melting that 

characterizes the generation of basic and ultrabasic alkaline magmas or equilibrate with 

them before their ascension and installation at crustal levels.  

Small Ti negative anomalies are also visible in some samples, arguing for early 

removal of this element by the crystallization of Fe-Ti oxides, respectively or due to 

source retention in Ti rich minerals.  

The nature and origin of these anomalies, their possible causes and implications 

for the composition and evolution history of the mantle source will be discussed in 

detail in section 7.4.

Ma alkaline igneous rocks. 

 



 

210 
 

The older intrusions (Foz da Fonte and Paço d’Ilhas sills), that belong to the first 

pulse of magmatic activity in the WIM (94-88 Ma, Miranda et al., 2009, this study), 

show multielemental plots that are distinct from the ones seen on the c. 72 Ma rocks 

(fig. 7.8). They have no systematic Zr and Hf anomalies and possess less important or 

absent K anomalies. Among the Paço d’Ilhas samples, the more evolved samples show 

negative Ti anomalies due to the removal of Fe-Ti oxides and clinopiroxene to the basic 

layers. 

Accordingly, the basic layers possess small negative anomalies for K and Sr. 

These anomalies may have been generated by the removal of plagioclase and K feldspar 

into the leucocratic layers by flotation of these less dense crystals, as suggested by 

Mahmoudi (1991). This is in agreement with the observed macroscopic layering in this 

sill. 

 

The REE (Rare Earth Elements) compositions are more homogeneous, with all 

the samples showing fractionated chondrite normalized REE patterns, being enriched in 

LREE (Light REE) and MREE (Medium REE) over HREE (Heavy REE) (LaN/YbN = 

48.9 – 8.8; TbN/YbN = 3.4-1.9) suggesting the influence of residual garnet during 

melting events since HREE are significantly more compatible than MREE in garnet 

than in the melt (e.g. McKenzie and O’Nions, 1991; Adam and Green, 2006). The REE 

patterns of each of the sampled occurrences (fig. 7.9) will be discussed in more detail 

below. 

7.1.2.2  Rare Earth Element abbundances 

No systematic differences are observed between rocks from both pulses of Late 

Cretaceous alkaline igneous activity. 

The southern Monchique and Loulé samples are among the most fractionated 

(fig. 7.9a), with (La/Yb)N ranging from 48.9 to 22.9. The patterns in the Loulé 

lamprophyres have a steeper slope and can cut across the curves of some of the basic 

Monchique samples, suggesting the derivation from a more enriched source or a source 

with higher amounts of residual garnet. 

On the other hand, the Sines gabbros and diorite are among the least fractionated 

(fig. 7.9b), with the Pedras Negras samples ((La/Yb)N = 15.2-8.8) being the least REE 

enriched of all the analyzed samples, probably as a result of their origin as cumulates of 

relatively REE depleted phases, such as olivine. Some of the samples from Sines, along 

with some of the Sintra gabbros ((La/Yb)N = 18.4-14.9) show small positive Eu 



 

211 
 

anomalies (Eu/Eu* 0.97-1.28) possibly due to the accumulation of Eu retaining 

plagioclase (fig. 7.9c).  

 

 
Fig. 7.9: Chondrite normalized (Palme and O’Neill, 2003) REE variation diagrams for all the studied 

occurrences. 
 

Samples from the LVC necks and flows, Cascais dykes and Mafra gabbroic plug 

all show similar LREE enriched patterns ((La/Yb)N = 26.1-13.3, fig. 7.9d). However, 

the Eiras do Faião sill shows some of the more enriched and fractionated compositions 

of the complex ((La/Yb)N = 29.6-28.7), while the more basic Lomba dos Pianos sill has 



 

212 
 

REE patterns similar to the basalts. The more evolved Anços and Montelevar sills are 

slightly more enriched in HREE ((La/Yb)N = 16.3-15.7; fig. 7.9e) which show mostly 

flat patterns, unlike the gently oblique basic samples. 

The Fontanelas seamount shows the same LREE enriched patterns ((La/Yb)N = 

25.3-16.6; fig. 7.9f), as the samples from Paço d’Ilhas and Foz da Fonte sills ((La/Yb)N 

= 20.8-14.7; fig. 7.9g), which belong to the first pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. 

The more evolved Paço d’Ilhas samples are also more HREE enriched showing 

the same flat HREE slopes observed in other more differentiated sills.  

The relatively flat HREE patterns observed in the more evolved samples 

translate into low (Gd/Lu)N ratios (2.4-3.16 for the more evolved sills against 5.99-3.2 

for the remaining samples, fig. 7.10c) and can be interpreted as an indicator of the 

influence of crustal contamination processes as an evolution mechanism for these rocks, 

since the continental crust is more HREE enriched and shows flatter HREE patterns and 

consequentially lower (Gd/Lu)N ratios (1.54-1.61, Rudnick and Gao, 2003). Further 

indicators for the occurrence of crustal contamination processes will be discussed in 

section 7.3.2. 

Crystal fractionation does not seem to change the (La/Yb)N of the samples  since 

YbN increases but (La/Yb)N ratios remain the same (fig. 7.10a).  

However, crystal fractionation and accumulation are responsible for some minor 

negative and positive Eu anomalies, respectively (fig. 7.9). Specifically the slightly 

positive anomalies in some of the Sintra and Sines gabbros due to plagioclase 

accumulation and the negative Eu anomalies in the Paço d’Ilhas sill, Sines diorite and in 

one of the basic rocks from Monchique caused by the removal of this mineral.  

Most of the samples show Eu/Eu* values of approximately 1.1 (with Eu* = 

?(SmNxGdN); Rollinson, 1993), corresponding to a small positive Eu anomaly (fig. 

7.10b). A correlation between lower Eu/Eu* and Sr/Nd is also observed, suggesting that 

the small negative Eu anomalies formed due to crystal fractionation and removal of 

plagioclase from the liquid in some of the Paço d’Ilhas sill, Sines diorite, Monchique 

and Montelevar sill (fig. 7.10b). This process also lowered the Sr/Nd ratio, since Sr is 

preferentially incorporated in plagioclase. Plagioclase accumulation is responsible for 

the higher Eu/Eu* and Sr/Nd values of some of the Sintra and Sines gabbros and also of 

the plagioclase rich Lomba dos Pianos sill. 

Plagioclase removal, however, seems to have played a relatively small role in 

controlling the evolution of these magmas since there are not many samples with low  



 

213 
 

Eu anomalies and low Sr/Nd coupled with Eu/Eu*. Also, Al2O3 continues to increase 

with increasing SiO2 for most of the samples (fig. 7.3), except some of the layered Paço 

d’Ilhas sill.

samples. 
 

The Middle REEs (MREEs) are more compatible with amphibole and depletion 

in MREE, such as Gd, in relation to LREE or HREE is usually associated with 

amphibole crystallization and removal. Although apatite is also REE compatible, 

removal of this mineral does not fractionate REE.  

As was stated above, (La/Yb)N ratios are not greatly affected by crystal 

fractionation, so deviations from the main trend in the (La/Yb)N vs (Gd/Lu)N diagram 



 

214 
 

should be caused by amphibole accumulation if they plot towards higher values of 

(Gd/Lu)N for a certain (La/Yb)N value or by crustal contamination if the opposite is 

observed. The amphibole rich Peninha and Praia Vasco da Gama gabbros in the Sintra 

and Sines igneous complexes, respectively, seem to show signs of amphibole 

accumulation, while the lower (Gd/Lu)N ratios of the more evolved Paço d’Ilhas and 

Anços sills seem to be related to crustal contamination processes.  

 

7.2. Radiogenic Isotope geochemistry 

Sr and Nd isotope analyses were carried out at the Laboratório de Geologia 

Isotópica of the Universidade de Aveiro, in collaboration with Prof. Maria do 

Rosário Azevêdo and under the technical supervision of Eng. Sara Ribeiro. Rb, Sr, 

Sm and Nd contents were previously determined by ICP-MS at Actlabs Ancaster, 

Ontario, Canada. A 2% error in values given for the concentration of these elements 

was assumed in order to calculate the errors in 87Rb/86Sr and 147Sm/144Nd.  

All the intervening reagents in the preparation of the samples were distilled by 

sub-boilling, and the water produced by a Milli-Q Element (Millipore) apparatus. 

The samples were mostly unaltered, but whenever trace amounts of 

secondary carbonate were present, the powders were leached in 1N acetic acid 

(CH3COOH) according to the following method, adapted from Weiss and Frey 

(1996): a) the sample is weighed into an acid washed Savillex© beaker; b) 10 mL 

of 1N acetic acid are added; c) the suspension is ultra-sonicated for 10 minutes; d) 

the supernatant is decanted; e) steps b to d are repeated until reaction stops and the 

supernatant is clear and pale yellow to colorless. In the case of the very altered 

pillow lavas from the Fontanelas seamount, the amount of carbonate present as a 

secondary phase that replaces igneous minerals or as vesicle fillings was so 

significant that the powders were leached according to this same procedure, but 

with 2.5 HCl instead of acetic acid. The residue is then thoroughly washed in water 

and dried in a hot plate before digestion.  

The samples were digested at 200 ºC during a 3 days period in Teflon Parr? 

acid digestion bombs containing 2 mL HF and 1 mL HNO3. Afterwards, the residue 

is dried and then redissolved with 3ml HCl 6N in the digestion bombs during 1 

night.  



 

215 
 

The elements to analyse were purified using conventional ion chromatography 

technique. In a first phase, for Sr and REE separation, the samples were dissolved and 

loaded in quartz columns containing AG8 50W Bio-Rad cation exchange resin 

(200-400 mesh) using HCl 2.5N as eluent for Sr and HCl 6N for REE. After, for Nd 

purification, the REE residue is evaporated in a hot plate, redissolved in 0.2 N HCl, 

and placed in a smaller quartz column containing Ln Resin (100-150 µm)–IChroM. 

The isotopic analysis for Sr and Nd were performed on a VG SECTOR 54 

multicollector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS). Sr was loaded on a 

single Ta filament with H3PO4, whereas Nd was loaded with HCl on a Ta outer side 

filament, in a triple filament arrangement. Data were acquired at dynamic mode with 

peak measurements at 1-2V to 88Sr and 0.8-1.5V to 144Nd. Sr and Nd isotopic ratios 

were corrected for mass fractionation relative to 88Sr/86Sr=0.1194 and 
146Nd/144Nd=0.7219. This study took place over two years, during which the SRM-987 

standard gave an average value between 0.7102562 ± 46 (N=23; conf. lim.=95%) and 

0.710243 ± 10 and (N=14; conf. lim.=95%) for  87Sr/86Sr, while the 143Nd/144Nd value 
for the JNdi-1 standard varied between 0.512105 ± 4 (N=18; conf. lim.=95%) and 

0.512098 ± 5 (N=14; conf. lim.=95%).  143Nd/144Nd data are normalized to La Jolla 

standard. The average levels of blanks were in the range 0.25-1.0 ng for Sr and 0.5-

1ng for Nd.  

Pb isotopic ratios were conducted at the Department of Petrology (FALW), 

Vrjie Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands, in collaboration with Dr. Jane 

Chadwick. All samples were treated in the same manner as standards and blanks 

using standard chemical separation techniques (after Pin, 1994). All errors are 

reported as 2?. 

Prior to dissolution, the samples containing secondary carbonate were 

leached with 6N HCl according to the procedure in Weiss and Frey (1996). 

Leached samples were then washed with MilliQ water and dried. These and 

the non leached samples, all weighing approximately 200 mg, were then placed in a 

Teflon beaker together with 2 mL 40% HF dist. and 0.8 mL conc. HNO3.The 

beakers were then placed on a hot plate at 150 ºC for 2-3 days while they were 

disgested. HNO3 was added until the sampled was completely destroyed. The 

sample was later dissolved in 6N HCl and left on the hot plate for 2-5 days. 



 

216 
 

Afterwards, this solution was split in two identical aliquots, one for the 

determination of elementar concentrations of Pb, U and Th which was diluted 5000 

times in 5% HNO3 and the other for the acquisition of the isotopic ratios.  

0.7 N HBr was later added to the aliquot intended for isotopic analysis in 

order to release the Pb. This solution was then centrifuged at 12000 RPM for 4 

minutes, transferred to a C-Tube and then pippeted into previously washed 0.15 mL 

glass columns with AGIx8 (200-400 mesh) ion exchange resin, where the Pb 

fraction was recovered using HBr and HCl. 

Elementar Pb, U and Th were analyzed in a Quadrupole Thermo X-Series II 

ICP-MS. Samples were prepared using a modified version of the method described by 

Turner et al. (1999). Detection limits and analytical precision ranged from&amp;lt;100 ppb to 

&lt;1 ppt, and relative analytical precision was typically approximately 2 to 5% (one 

standard deviation). See Eggins et al. (1997) for an in-depth description of the method 

used. 

Pb isotopes were analysed by standard–sample bracketing using a Thermo 

Finnigan Neptune multi-collector ICP-MS. All analyses were conducted using a 

Cetac AX-100 autosampler, in combination with a Cetac Aridus nebuliser to 

introduce samples into the MC-ICP-MS. The wash-out time between analyses was 3 

min, and uptake time 2 min. A total of 5 blocks of 20 cycles were measured, with 

integration times of 4 s per cycle. Levels of 201Hg were always less than 0.05mV. 

For each measurement, the average of the two bracketing machine blanks 

was subtracted before calculation of the Pb isotopic ratios. The blank levels varied 

between sessions with intensities of 1.5–3.0 mV on 208Pb. Variable blank correction 

always introduced fewer uncertainties than the error from counting statistics in the 

concentration range of our solutions.  

A 100 ppb solution of NIST SRM-981 standard gave 16.9367 ± 10, 15.4950 

± 10 and 36.7147 ± 23 (2?, n= 3) for 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb, 

respectively. The values of Baker et al. (2004) were used for normalisation. For the 

BHVO standard, these ratios yielded 18.76084 ± 10, 15.6281 ± 10 and 38.7385 ± 

22 for 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb, respectively (2?, n=2). Full 

procedure Pb blank solutions were in the order of 0.05 ppb, corresponding to 150 

pg Pb. Data reduction was done offline, following the formula for sample–standard 

bracketing (Albarède et al., 2004). The calculation of error propagation was 

performed using relative errors (%). All errors given on Pb isotopic ratios are 2 



 

217 
 

standard deviations (absolute). A detailed description of the method applied can be 

found in Elburg et al. (2005). 

 

7.2.1 Introduction 

Intraplate continental alkaline magmas have to cross thick continental 

lithosphere before they are erupted or emplaced at shallow depths. Therefore, besides 

carrying information about their original source, these magmas can also provide clues 

about the nature of the crust and lithospheric mantle they cut through, as well as 

information concerning the processes that control their evolution during the ascent to 

the surface. Long-lived radioactive isotopes are powerful tools for such studies, since 

they can be used as tracers for mantle and crustal magma generation, evolution and even 

mixing processes.  

Isotope ratios for long lived isotopic reservoir, such as any sort of isolated 

volume of the mantle, are a linear function of their parent/daughter ratio (e.g. Rb/Sr in 

the 87Rb ? 87Sr system) and a nearly linear function of time or geological age of the 

system. When this mantle domain undergoes equilibrium partial melting, the melt 

inherits the isotopic ratio of the entire system. Consequently, radiogenic isotope ratios 

are powerful tracers of the parent–daughter ratios of mantle sources of igneous rocks 

and of their evolution in time. If isotope data from several other long lived decay 

systems are combined (e.g 147Sm ? 144Nd, 235U ? 207Pb, 238U ? 206Pb, 232Th ? 208Pb 

etc), a better image of source chemistry and history can be constructed, since different 

isotopic systems have different geochemical properties that lead to the development of 

distinct parent-daughter isotope ratios on major reservoirs. For example, Sr and Rb are 

both incompatible, but with ??? &amp;lt;???, and concentrate in mantle melts, 

consequentially the mantle domains affected by magmatic extraction have a low Rb/Sr 

ratio and evolved towards low 87Sr/86Sr. However, Sm/Nd ratios are higher in the 

mantle, while differentiated crustal rocks are enriched in the slightly more incompatible 

Nd relative to Sm, so the mantle rocks usually show higher 143Nd /144Nd ratios than 

crustal rocks, especially the more differentiated ones, which have low 143Nd /144Nd. In 

summary, most of the differences in isotopic composition are a result of ancient 

chemical fractionation events and the consequent time integrated evolution under 

different parent/daughter ratios.  



 

218 
 

It is generally much easier to measure the ratio of two isotopes than the absolute 

abundance of one. We therefore measure the ratio of, for example, 87Sr to a non-

radiogenic isotope, which by convention is 86Sr. In this work, these ratios will be used, 

together with some incompatible trace element ratios, as tracers of mantle sources, 

crust–mantle interaction processes, and mantle melting processes, with the aim of 

understanding the petrogenesis of the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM. 

Another possible way of representing isotopic ratios is through the Epsilon (?) 

notation, that describes the deviations of several isotopic ratios from the ones attributed 

to the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir (CHUR – an approximation of the isotopic values 

on the chondritic solar system, before planetary differentiation took place (DePaolo and 
Wasserburg, 1976), at the time (t) of rock formation. This value is given by the 

following equation: 
 

?Nd(t) = [(143Nd/144Nd)sample(t)/ (143Nd/144Nd)CHUR(t)-1] x 10000 
 

Epsilon units usually correspond to larger numbers and are therefore a more 

easily understood representation of the initial isotopic ratios, rendering comparisons 

between different rocks an easier task.  

 

7.2.2 Results 

The studied samples show relatively low 87Sr/86Sri (0.703005 to 0.704884) and 

high ?Ndi (and high 143Nd/144Nd) values (5.8 to2.8) that plot on the depleted quadrant of 

the 87Sr/86Sri vs. ?Ndi diagram (fig. 7.11), showing lower values of 87Sr/86Sri than Bulk 

Earth and higher ?Ndi than the CHUR, except for the sample from the Lomba dos 

Pianos sill that is distinctively more enriched in 87Sr/86Sri. These values suggest a time 

integrated depletion in Rb and Nd relative to Sr and Sm, respectively, which is in 

contrast with the previously mentioned trace element enriched nature of these rocks. 

The majority of the basic samples that do not present any evidence for 

contamination by crustal lithologies show a narrow Sr and Nd isotopic range and plot 

mostly between the HIMU and FOZO components (87Sr87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 

5.7 – 3.7, fig. 7.10-11). Meanwhile, some of the more evolved samples (Paço d’Ilhas 

sill, Anços sill) and one basic dyke (basalt dyke from Cascais) define a trend towards 

more radiogenic Sr isotopic ratios and lower ?Nd (87Sr/86Sri up to 0.7049 and ?Ndi as 

low as 3.1, fig. 7.10-12), probably as a result of contamination by crustal lithologies.  



 

219 
 

Fig. 7.11: Sr-Nd isotopic plot comparing locations representative of different mantle end-member 
compositions and the Common Mantle Reservoir (CMR, Lustrino and Wilson, 2007) with the Late 
Cretaceous intraplate alkaline magmatism of the West Iberian Margin. Data for the ocean island that 
represent the different mantle end members from the GEOROC database (http://georoc.mpch-
mainz.gwdg.de/georoc/). For more information on mantle components, see section 3. 

 

It is possible to observe two trends diverging from the central cluster of values 

(87Sr/86Sri 0.703-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7-3.7, figs. 7.11-12). One trend is defined by the 

Malveira da Serra, Montelevar and Lomba dos Pianos sills and is characterized by an 
87Sr/86Sri increase while ?Ndi remains unaltered. In the second trend, represented by the 

Paço d’Ilhas and Anços sills and one of the Cascais dykes, 87Sr/86Sri increases 

simultaneously as ?Ndi decreases (fig. 7.11-12). These two trends are probably the 

result of contamination by crustal lithologies with different isotopic and trace element 

abundances, and will be discussed in more detail later in section 7.3.2. They do not 

seem to reflect secondary alteration and the addition of secondary carbonated material 

since the samples were leached with acetic acid, which successfully removed that 

secondary carbonated fraction in the Foz da Fonte and Anços sills (fig. 7.13).   

A tentative explanation for the observed inconsistency between the enriched 

trace element signatures and depleted Sr and Nd isotopic composition shown by the 

Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM is that the trace element enrichment of the 

source could be attributed to a mantle metasomatism event that possibly occurred 



 

220 
 

shortly before the generation of these magmas, adding incompatible trace elements to 

the source while not affecting its originally depleted isotopic composition. Since this 

enrichment took place shortly before magma generation, the source for these rocks did 

not have sufficient time to evolve into a more significantly enriched and heterogenous 

isotopic composition. Such a metasomatic agent could have been a liquid derived from 

very low amounts of partial melting from a relatively isotopically depleted reservoir, 

such as the asthenospheric mantle, or the first melt fractions of an ascending mantle 

plume, as is suggested by several authors for other cases of intraplate alkaline 

magmatism (e.g. Niu, 2008; Pilet et al., 2008, 2010; Martins et al., 2010) and seems to 

be supported by mineral chemistry data presented in section 6.2. Evidence provided by 

trace element geochemistry for the existence of metasomatic mantle processes will be 

discussed in section 7.4.

Cretaceous intraplate alkaline magmatism of the West Iberian Margin. Data for the CMR, the Madeira

The samples from the nearby Late Cretaceous Ormonde seamount (? 67 Ma) and 

Madeira-Tore Rise (? 80 -100 Ma) show even more depleted Nd isotopic compositions, 

with higher ?Ndi values, but on the other hand show a similar 87Sr/86Sri range (fig. 7.11).  



 

221 
 

In most cases, the uncontaminated basic Late Cretaceous Alkaline rocks from 

the WIM also plot in the same fields defined by the Common Mantle Reservoir (CMR, 

a mantle reservoir defined as a common source component for the rocks of the circum-

Mediterranean anorogenic Cenozoic igneous province by Lustrino and Wilson, 2007), 

the Canaries mantle plume and Cenozoic alkaline magmatism occurred in Spain.

Fonte, Malveira da Serra and Anços sills. The leaching process resulted in a significant decrease of 
87Sr/86Sr. 

 

Pb isotopes show 206Pb/204Pbi (18.827-19.564) compositions that are more 

enriched than DMM and most of the samples with EM component signatures, but less 

enriched than HIMU (figs. 7.14 and 7.15). 207Pb/204Pbi values (15.567-15.634) define a 

compositional array close to the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line (NHRL, a trend 

defined by the basalts from the Mid Atlantic Ridge basalts and ocean islands of the 

northern Atlantic, Hart, 1984) and EM II (fig. 7.14), while 208Pb/204Pbi (38.603-39.948) 

shows values trend close to the NHRL between EM II and HIMU, except for the 

samples from the Fontanelas seamount who show higher 208Pb/204Pbi values. The origin 



 

222 
 

of such high 208Pb/204Pbi in the Fontanelas seamount will be addressed in detail in 

section 7.5.2.

and Canaries hotspots, Spanish and Moroccan cenzoic magmatism from Lustrino and Wilson (2007). 

 

The more basic samples cluster around 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 

15.609-15.580 and 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00 values, along the NHRL. The more 



 

224 
 

evolved rocks, along with the gabbros from Sintra and Sines, show Pb isotopic 

signatures that plot progressively away from the NHRL, towards higher 207Pb/204Pbi 

(max. 15.634) and lower206Pb/204Pbi (min. 18.827) and 208Pb/204Pbi (min. 38.603), which 

is likely to be related to crustal contamination, a process which will be discussed in 

detail in section 7.3.2. 

The basic samples also plot near some samples from the Madeira Tore rise and, 

more consistently, the Ormonde seamount (fig. 7.14 and 7.15). However, the 

compositions of these two submarine features tend to show more enriched Pb isotopic 

values, including much higher 207Pb/204Pbi.  

They also fall within the fields defined by the CMR and Canaries hotspots, with 

some of the more evolved samples and gabbros trending towards Pb isotopic 

compositions that plot into the fields defined by other intraplate continental alkaline 

occurrences in the region such as the Moroccan and Spanish Cenozoic alkaline 

magmatism (fig. 7.15).  

This might indicate that similar evolution mechanisms, such as crustal 

contamination, characterized the evolution of the magmas in all these provinces. One of 

the seamounts of the MTR and some of the samples from the Ormonde peak on the 

Gorringe bank seem to show composition affinities with the samples from the Madeira 

hotspot, falling into or near the field they define in the diagrams. 

On the Pb-Sr and Pb-Nd isotopic spaces (figs. 7.16 and 7.17) the studied 

samples also plot in between a more depleted PREMA like reservoir and the high U/Pb 

HIMU, near FOZO. Some of the evolved samples show a trend towards EM type 

compositions. These correspond to the more evolved and possibly contaminated 

samples which plot closer to the EM II domain. 

Samples from the basic rocks present in the Sines and Sintra complexes show 

distinct behaviors from their basic counterparts in the WIM as is shown by the Pb-Pb, 

Pb-Sr and Pb-Nd diagrams (figs. 7.14-17). They plot along with the more evolved and 

possibly contaminated samples in the Pb-Pb isotopic space and show intermediate 

compositions in the Pb-Sr and Pb-Nd diagrams with more basic and evolved rocks in 

the Pb-Sr and Pb-Nd diagrams.  

Comparing our results with the alkaline rocks of similar age present in the region 

(fig. 7.17), it is discernible that they show, in general, consistently lower Nd and in most 

cases higher Sr isotopic ratios than the nearby Madeira-Tore rise and Ormonde 



 

225 
 

seamount for similar 206Pb/204Pb values. Again, the more evolved rocks tend to show 

isotopic signatures similar to the ones shown by the Cenozoic alkaline magmatism 

present in Spanish territory. Some of the basic samples plot in the fields defined by 

samples from the Canaries hotspot.

Margin. Data for the CMR from Lustrino and Wilson (2007), and for the ocean island that represent the

These results seem to indicate that the studied rocks originated from a source 

with a Sr  Nd time integrated isotopic depletion, suggesting the involvement of a 

sublithospheric source that is slightly more enriched than the asthenospheric mantle 

sampled in the Mid Ocean Ridges (DMM component) but with different, less radiogenic 

compositions than the EM and HIMU components. 

Meanwhile, the Pb isotopic composition of the same rocks is quite radiogenic 

and argues for a source with higher time integrated U/Pb ratios than the depleted 

asthenospheric mantle or the EM mantle components.  

The source for the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM could reside 

either in a mantle plume component or at the metasomatized lithospheric mantle. These 

hypothesis will be address in more detail in section 7.5. 

One sample from a basaltic dyke in Cascais (RM 64) shows a rather enigmatic 

isotopic signature, having higher 87Sr/86Sri  and lower ?Ndi than other basic rocks in the 
region, while showing similar radiogenic Pb ratios. This could be either due to crustal 

contamination by a more enriched crustal lithology or to a lithospheric contribution 

during the generation of this dyke. This subject will de approached in more detail 

below.  

 



 

227 
 

7.3 Magmatic evolution processes 

Parental magmas tend to generate more evolved, silica rich liquids through 

differentiation processes such as fractional crystallization, assimilation/crustal 

contamination and mixing with other melts. 

The influence of these processes in the composition and evolution of the Late 

Cretaceous Alkaline rocks from the WIM is discussed in this section.  

 

7.3.1 Fractional Crystallization  

As was previously mentioned on the major and trace element characterization of 

the samples, the fractional crystallization and removal and/or accumulation of olivine, 

clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, and in some cases even plagioclase and apatite, seems to 

have had an important role in the evolution of the alkaline magmatic suites observed on 

the West Iberian Margin. 

Some of the evidence for the importance of crystal accumulation has already 

been discussed in the petrographical characterization of the samples (section 6.1) and 

during the geochemical description of the studied samples (sections 7.1 and 7.2). Its 

effects are also evident from the observation of figures 7.1-4 and 7.7-10 and generally 

result in marked enrichements or depletions in a certain element that is abundant in a 

given mineral. Samples are usually enriched in such an element if that mineral has 

accumulated in the studied rock or depleted if it has been extensively removed from the 

melt. 

As the rocks sampled in this study have different ages, and are not from a single 

intrusion or complex, it cannot be assumed that crystal fractionation affected these 

intrusions in the same way, since fractionating assemblages should vary. Therefore, in 

order to illustrate the role of crystal fractionation on the variability of the alkaline 

magmas from the WIM, the modeling effort will be concentrated on the LVC and 

associated minor intrusions (see section 2.3), since this complex was more extensively 

sampled. 

As was already mentioned, primary rocks are absent in the LVC as well as from 

the other sampled occurrences. This is by itself evidence for the importance of fractional 

crystallization processes in the evolution of the rocks from the WIM, and argues for the 

existence of deeper chambers where fractionation of at least olivine, chromian spinel 

and maybe even clinopyroxene and other phases (e.g. amphibole, apatite) took place.  



 

228 
 

In order to model the crystal fractionation processes in the rocks from the LVC 

and try to evaluate the role of this process in the differentiation of these magmas, 

sample RM 69 was selected as being representative of the parental composition from 

which most of the rocks associated with this complex might have evolved. This sample 

has relatively high MgO, Ni and Cr concentrations and Mg# (MgO 9.98 %, Ni 143 ppm, 

Cr 400 ppm and Mg# 65.1) and shows no signs that its composition was controlled by 

crystal accumulation. Other samples with higher contents in Ni, Cr and MgO can be 

found among the sampled LVC rocks, but their compositions and textures shows 

evidence for modification by important crystal accumulation. 

The amount of fractional crystallization of a certain mineral phase or assemblage 

necessary to generate the observed compositional spectrum can be modeled using the 

Rayleigh law, which describes the case where crystals are removed from the melt 

instantly after crystallization (e.g. Rollinson, 1993). The equation that describes 

Rayleigh/fractional crystallization is: 
??
??

= ?(???) 

 
Where Cl is the concentration of an element in the remaining magmatic liquid, C0 is the 

concentration of the same element in the initial magma, F is the remaining melt fraction 

and D is the partition coefficient between the crystallizing mineral(s) and the magmatic 

liquid.  

This can be rewritten as: 

?? = ??(???)? ?  ?? 

This will give the concentration on an element of known D in the remaining 

liquid after a certain amount (1-F) of the fractional crystallization of a given mineral or 

mineral assemblage. 

K is not a stoichiometric element relatively to any of the minerals thought to 

have fractionated in the LVC, it behaves incompatibly, and does not show much 

variation between samples with a given SiO2 content, so it was chosen to be the 

differentiation proxy plotted in the X axis of the diagrams used to evaluate the role of 

the fractional crystallization process. 

Overall, the evolution of the concentrations for the compatible trace elements 

(Ni, Cr, Sc, V) from basanitic to intermediate terms is in agreement with the fractional 



 

229 
 

crystallization of an assemblage of clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine (20%) + plagioclase 

(17.5%) + magnetite (7.5%) (fig. 7.18).

Sr shows a different behavior, becoming compatible in some of the more 

evolved samples, like the Anços and Montelevar sills. Some of the incompatible trace 

elements, such as Rb and Ba, also seem to follow a trend compatible with the fractional 

crystallization of that same assemblage. Still, not all of the samples plot near the 

modeled trend for the more incompatible Zr, La, Nb and Th (fig. 7.18).  

In some cases this seems to be due to the choice of a relatively enriched initial 

composition for the parental liquid used in this modeling, since the remaining samples 

sometimes appear to define evolution trends parallel to the modeled one. However, the 

more evolved, silica saturated Anços and Montelevar sills, seem to define  a  different 

trend, oblique to the calculated one, characterized by a less pronounced enrichment in 

incompatible trace elements. This implies that fractional crystallization is not the only 

mechanism controlling the evolution of this rock suite. 

These results must be regarded with caution and only as giving a general idea of 

the crystal fractionation processes affecting the LVC, as its accurate interpretation must 

take into account: 

1) the possible occurrence of distinct parental magmas (mantle source 

heterogeneity and/or several distinct melting events); 

2) the fact that, as shown before (see section 6), the fractionating phase(s) can 

change during the evolutionary process; 

3) the existence of assimilation and contamination processes. 

If we apply the same calculated fractional crystallization trend to the entire data 

set in order to encompass all of the studied samples, one can observe the existence of 

similar trends to the ones identified for the LVC (fig. 7.19), indicating that that these 

magmas might have evolved through the fractionation of relatively similar mineral 

assemblages.  

In fig. 7.19 it is noticeable that the Sr concentration for the Anços, Montelevar 

and especially the Paço d’Ilhas sill show a considerable divergence from the main trend 

observed for the evolution of Sr with K, showing a compatible behaviour. To explain 

this change in behavior it is necessary to model the crystal fractionation of a different 

crystal assemblage (fig. 7.19) with with plagioclase (50%), clinopyroxene (30%), 

amphibole (10%) and magnetite (10%) (green trend in fig. 7.19).

+ magnetite (7.5%) and (B) plagioclase (50%), clinopyroxene (30%), amphibole (10%) and magnetite 

(10%). Each tick mark corresponds to 10% increment of the crystallized mass. 
 

It should be noted that the modeled fractional crystallization curve requires the 

crystallization of nearly 80% of the original basanitic liquid in order to reproduce the 



 

232 
 

observed geochemical evolution (figs. 7.18 and 7.19), which seems to be a very high 

value and can also be considered as suggestive of the existence of other processes 

controlling the evolution of these rocks. However, if only the LVC is considered, the 

remaining 20% of the liquid are roughly in the same proportion of evolved rocks 

present in this complex.

In summary, fractional crystallization is an important process in the evolution 

of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM, as demonstated by the modeling 

of the evolution of the samples associated with the LVC through the crystallization and 

removal of an assemblage of clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine (20%) + plagioclase 

(17.5%) + magnetite (7.5%). The remaining samples of the studied Late Cretaceous 

alkaline rocks plot close to the line defined by this model but the more evolved terms 

define a trend that is oblique to the obtained fractional crystallization curve. This and 

the some elemental and isotopic characteristics of the more evolved samples suggest 

that, besides fractional crystallization, these rocks should have been under the influence 

of other processes during their evolution, such as crustal contamination. 

 



 

233 
 

7.3.2 Crustal Contamination 

The absence of samples that might correspond to primary magmatic liquids 

among the basic alkaline rocks of the WIM argues for the occurrence of stagnation in 

magma chambers and important fractional crystallization before these magmas reached 

the upper crustal levels.  

Such a setting is also compatible with a scenario where crustal rocks or melts 

can be assimilated or mixed with the ascending magmas, contaminating the mantle 

melts and changing their isotopic and trace element signature, since stagnation and 

crystallization of basic magmas will provide the country rock with the heat necessary 

for its fusion and subsequent mixing with the basic magmas (e.g. DePaolo et al., 1981; 

Reiners et al., 1995; Spera and Bohrson, 2001; Bohrson and Spera, 2001). This 

hypothesis is addressed below. 

 

 

7.3.2.1 Trace element and isotopic evidences for contamination 

The most obvious indication for the existence of crustal contamination as an 

important petrogenetic process is the variation of the isotopic ratios with increasing 

silica, i.e. with magmatic evolution. In fig. 7.19a-e it is visible that 87Sr/86Sr and 
207Pb/204Pb increase, but 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb decrease with 

increasing SiO2. This is a strong indicator for increasing assimilation of siliceous crustal 

material with continuing crystallization. 

Some samples, however, show high 87Sr/86Sr and relatively unchanged ?Ndi and 

Pb isotopic ratios while having low SiO2 contents (Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da 

Serra sills and a basaltic dyke from Cascais, see also figs 7.11 to 7.13), which argues for 

the existence of another type of possibly SiO2-poor contaminant. 

Although none of the analyzed samples shows Nb and Ta negative anomalies 

which are classic indicators of contamination by crustal material, which is depleted in 

these elements (Rudnick and Gao, 2003), the observed increase in Th/La, Zr/Nb and 

K/Nb towards values closer to crustal compositions with increasing SiO2 (fig. 7.20) 

cannot be explained by fractional crystallization processes alone, which would result on 

the persistence of the same values for incompatible trace element ratios from basic to 

acid terms. Thus, the input from a contaminant with higher Zr/Nb, Th and K and lower 



 

234 
 

La and Nb than the original magmas is required to cause an increase of these ratios with 

magmatic evolution. 

The continental crust has higher Th/La (Upper Continental Crust 0.34; Lower 

Continental Crust 0.15; Rudnick and Gao, 2003), Zr/Nb (UCC = 16.1; LCC 13.6; 

Rudnick and Gao, 2003) and K/Nb (UCC = 1937; LCC 1012; Rudnick and Gao, 2003) 

and is the most likely contaminant of these magmas. 

Nb/U decreases with increasing silica (fig. 7.21) to values below those 

associated with oceanic ocean island basalts linked to mantle plumes or the 

asthenosphere (47 ± 10; Hoffman et al., 1986), which is also in agreement with 

contamination of these samples by crustal lithologies with lower Nb/U (UCC = 4.44; 

LCC 25.0; Rudnick and Gao, 2003).  

 

 
Fig. 7.20: Plots of SiO2 vs. isotopic ratios showing changes with increasing silica contents. 

 

Some samples have higher Nb/U than ocean basalts (fig. 7.21), probably due to 

the removal of U during alteration by aqueous fluids since most of these high values 

occur in the Sintra, Sines and Monchique intrusive complexes, where late hydrothermal 

alteration is observed, or in the extensively seawater altered pillow lavas of the 

Fontanelas Seamount. 



 

235 
 

The higher contents in HREE, low values of (Gd/Lu)N (fig. 7.10,) and flatter 

HREE profiles (fig. 7.9) discussed in section 7.1.2 also argue for significant crustal 

assimilation in the more evolved samples, especially the sills of intermediate 

composition.  

 

 
Fig. 7.21: Plots of SiO2 vs. Th/La, K/Nb, Zr/Nb and Nb/U for the studied samples. The more SiO2 rich 

samples show progressively higher Th/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb and lower Nb/U reflecting the progressive 

contamination of these rocks by crystal lithologies. See text for discussion. 

 



 

236 
 

 
Fig. 7.22: Plots of trace element ratios Th/La, K/Nb, Zr/Nb and Nb/U vs. isotopic ratios of the analyzed 

samples. See text for discussion. 



 

237 
 

Increasing Th/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb, and decreasing Nb/U also correlate with 

increasing 87Sr/86Sri (fig. 7.22), which is in accordance with the contamination of the 

initial basic magmas by a crustal lithology with high time integrated Rb/Sr. 

?Ndi values decrease with increasing Th/La and with decreasing Nb/U but show 

more complex relations with K/Nb and Zr/Nb, hinting that there might be some 

heterogeneity in the composition of the contaminants that were assimilated by these 

magmas (fig. 7.22). 

The Pb isotopic composition of these rocks evolves towards less radiogenic 
206Pb/204Pbi and 208Pb/204Pbi compositions with increasing Th/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb and 

decreasing Nb/U. 207Pb/204Pbi shows the opposite behavior, increasing towards higher 

Th/La, K/Nb and Zr/Nb and lower Nb/U (fig. 7.21). The high 207Pb/204Pb suggests that 

this crustal contaminant is quite old due to its enrichement in 207Pb. This is because the 

half life of 235U is relatively short (235U ? 207Pb 0.7038 x 109 a) when compared with 

the half life of 238U (238U ? 206Pb 4.468 x 109 a), so high 207Pb coupled with low 206Pb 

values must have been generated relatively early in the Earth’s history, when 235U was 

more abundant.  

From the data presented above, the more contaminated rocks seem to correspond 

to the intermediate sills (Anços, Montelevar, Paço d’Ilhas), with the diorites from the 

Sintra and Sines igneous complex and the Cascais dykes (including basaltic sample 

RM64) also showing evidence for some crustal contribution to their composition (figs. 

7.20 and 7.21). 

The samples from the Sintra and Sines igneous complexes deserve special 

attention since they have higher 207Pb/204Pbi and lower 206Pb/204Pbi and 208Pb/204Pbi than 

the other basic samples and are an exception to the general observed variations, showing 

apparently contaminated Pb isotopic ratios but relatively uncontaminated trace element, 

Nd and Sr isotope signatures (figs. 7.14-15 and 7.20-22).  This could  mean that  the  Pb 

isotopic signatures either reflect the contamination by a lithology with similar Sr and Nd 

isotopic signatures but distinct Pb isotopic ratios or that the contaminated Pb signature 

in these rocks might be  an   artifact  created  by  the  secondary  hydrothermal   

alteration  that  affected  these intrusions (see section 6.1). Since Pb is present in low 

concentrations in the rocks of the alkaline complexes (3.1-4.7 ppm), but high 

temperature, Cl rich hydrothermal fluids might show high contents in Pb (e.g. Simonetti 

and Bell, 1994), it is possible that the hydrothermal fluids might have introduced 

significant radiogenic Pb. It is possible that the Pb and a portion of the hydrothermal 



 

238 
 

fluids originated from within the surrounding sedimentary rocks which could contain 

more radiogenic lead. However, it is necessary that these fluids contained significantly 

less Sr and Nd than the Sintra and Sines gabbros, so that hydrothermal alteration at low 

water:rock ratios (&lt;&amp;lt;1) resulted in unchanged Sr and Nd isotopic ratios (e.g. Tepley 

and Davidson, 2003) while being responsible for a more contaminated isotopic Pb 

signature.  

Alternatively, this secondary process might simply have resulted in changes in 

the U/Pb and U/Th ratios, leading to inadequate correction for U decay and incorrect 

initial Pb isotopic ratios. U, along with Pb, could have been leached from the rock 

during the hydrothermal alteration phase, while less mobile Th should have remained 

unaltered. However, the simultaneous changes in all the Pb isotopic ratios and the low 

measured 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb and high 206Pb/204Pb suggest this is not the most 

likely case. 

Recapitulating, the data indicate that most of the more evolved terms in the 

analyzed rocks interacted with a crustal contaminant rich in SiO2, Th, K, 87Sr/86Sr and 
207Pb/204Pb, but depleted in La, Nb, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb.  

A smaller group of samples, represented by the Lomba dos Pianos, Malveira da 

Serra and Montelevar sills, seems to have assimilated a contaminant with high 87Sr/86Sr 

but which apparently contained low amounts of Nd and Pb, since the isotopic ratios of 

these elements do not appear to have been affected by this event.  

 

The samples displaying the stronger indications of contamination (the more 

evolved sills and dykes present in the Lisbon region, as well as the diorites from the 

Sintra and Sines complexes, figs. 7.19-21) intrude the Mesozoic siliciclastic, carbonate 

and evaporitic sediment cover of the Lusitanian basin (e.g. Kullberg, 2000) in the upper 

crust and had to cut through  the Ossa Morena zone mafic to felsic plutons and 

metassediments of the middle and lower crust (Capdevila and Mougenot, in Boilot and 

Winterer (eds.), 1988). The contaminants assimilated by the studied rocks are most 

likely to correspond to either acid igneous rocks or metassediments in the Paleozoic 

Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) and/or sediments in the Lusitanian Basin (LB) that either 

resulted from the erosion of lithologies in the OMZ and Central Iberian Zone (CIZ) or 

from precipitation of carbonate from Mesozoic Atlantic waters. The contaminant can 

also be a mix of sediments from the different Paleozoic terranes, and therefore show 

7.3.2.2 Quantifying crustal contamination by AFC 



 

239 
 

different signatures in accordance to the proportion in which each of these terranes are 

represented. 

Assimilation of crustal rocks can take place simultaneously with fractional 

crystallization, in a mechanism known as Assimilation and Fractional Crystallization 

(AFC, DePaolo, 1981). The equation that describes the behavior of trace elements 

during such a processes was derived by DePaolo (1981) and corresponds to: 

 
??
??

= ?? +
?

? ? ? + ?
?  ??/??(? ? ??) 

where ?? , ?? and ?? correspond to the concentration of a trace element in question in 

the residual melt, the parental liquid and the assimilant, respectively. D is the bulk 

distribution coefficient for that same element, r the ratio of the assimilation rate to the 

ratio of the crystallization rate and ?? is given by: ?? =  ??(???+?)/(???), where F is the 

fraction of melt remaining. 

The evolution of isotopic ratios during such a process is also described by 

DePaolo (1981) and given by the following equation: 

??
? = ??

? + ??? ? ??
?? ? (? ? ?

??
?

??
? ? ??) 

where ??
?,  ??

? and ?? ,  are the isotopic ratios of the residual melt, of the parental magma 

and of the contaminant, respectively. ??
? is the  concentration of  the trace element 

whose isotopic ratios is being addressed in the parental magma while ??
? is the 

concentration of that same element in the contaminant. 

These equations allow the modeling of the behavior of trace elements and 

isotopic ratios during AFC but are rather simplistic, assuming constant distribution 

coefficients and assimilation to crystallization ratios for the entirety of the process, 

which is unrealistic. They also fail to integrate any estimate of the volume of crustal 

contribution and disregard the thermal constrains of the AFC process, which is a serious 

flaw since the energy to heat and melt the country rock comes from the intruding 

magma and its crystallization, and is therefore a function of its composition (e.g. 

Reiners et al., 1995; Spera and Bohrson, 2001; Bohrson and Spera, 2001). 

Several possible contaminants were used to test if they fitted the evolution trend 

of the geochemical signatures of the more contaminated rocks in the West Iberian 

Margin, namely metassediments and granitoids from both the OMZ and CIZ, and 

carbonates from the LB.  



 

240 
 

The compositions of these contaminants are averages of the existing analysis 

from rocks belonging to each of the different Paleozoic terranes (OMZ 

metassediments: Borrego, 2009; Chaminé et al., 2000; Chichorro et al., 2008; Pereira 

et al., 2006; 2007; OMZ granitoids: Brandés et al., 2004; Chichorro et al., 2008; 

Lopez-Guijarro, et al., 2008; Moita et al., 2009; Montero et al., 1999; Pereira et al., 

2007; Pin et al., 2008; Priem et al., 1986; CIZ metassediments: Bea et al., 2003; 

Ugidos et al., 1997 Lopez-Guijarro, et al., 2008; CIZ granitoids: Antunes et al., 2007; 
Azevedo and Nolan, 1998; Casquet et al., 2001; Dias et al., 2002; Gomes and Neiva, 

2005; Martins et al., 2009; Neiva et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2000; Vale Aguado et al., 

2006; Villaseca et al., 1998; 2009); the isotopic composition of the Lusitanian basin 

carbonates was calculated using the Nd and Sr isotopic composition values for the 

Atlantic seawater (McArthur et al., 2001; Stille et al., 1996) while their elementar Sr 

composition was assumed to correspond to an average Phanerozoic carbonate (Condie, 

1991) and for Nd and other trace elements, a composition corresponding to the average 

of the values reported in Plank and Langmuir (1998) and Gao et al. (1998).  

The effect of AFC processes in the Pb isotopic signature of the studied rocks 

was not evaluated due to the lack of data for any of the possible contaminants. 

Also, the composition of the contaminant(s) for rocks with such a wide 

geographical distribution and showing different modes of occurrence is expected to be 

isotopically heterogeneous and so the models presented here are only indicative of 

possible scenarios that could have occurred during the evolution of the Late Cretaceous 

alkaline magmas of the WIM. 

The results yielded by this method, using the D values as the ones indicated in 

table 7.4 and an r value of 0.3, which is approximately the value calculated by Taylor 

(1980) for a typical upper crustal case, are displayed in fig. 7.23. 

They show that some of the more enriched isotopic and trace element signatures 

can be obtained by assimilation of a crustal rock with a composition similar to the one 

found in the metassediments of the OMZ, along with the ? 40% crystallization of the 

same paragenesis modeled in for fractional crystallization (see section 7.3.1). However, 

the Sr-Nd signatures of the samples with lowest 144Nd/143Nd as well as those that show 

both high 144Nd/143Nd and 87Sr/86Sr cannot be reproduced by assimilation of such a 

lithology.

samples with the lines of compositional variation for the AFC modelling of several different 

contaminants. Each of the marks in the contamination lines represents a 0.1 increase in F or a 10% 

decrease in the remaining melt fraction. See text for discussion. 

 

The other tested contaminants seem to be unable to replicate the observed 

compositional features, producing changes in 87Sr/86Sr that are not accompanied by the 

necessary decrease in 144Nd/143Nd to in order to generate isotopic signatures similar to 

the ones observed in the alkaline rocks of the WIM. 

 

The equations that allow the modeling of the behavior of trace elements and 

isotopic ratios during AFC are rather simplistic, assuming constant distribution 

coefficients and assimilation to crystallization ratios for the entirety of the process, 

which is unrealistic. They also fail to integrate any estimate of the volume of crustal 

contribution and disregard the thermal constrains of the AFC process, which is a serious

flaw since the energy to heat and melt the country rock comes from the intruding 

magma and its crystallization, and is therefore a function of its composition (e.g. 

Reiners et al., 1995; Spera and Bohrson, 2001; Bohrson and Spera, 2001). 

Energy Constrained Assimilation and Factional Crystallization (EC-AFC; Spera 

and Bohrson, 2001) is an alternative method to model the AFC process that self 

consistently balances thermal energy conservation, species and mass while also tracking 

compositional variations generated in the anatetic melt as country rock undergoes 

partial melting. It integrates the the effects of energy conservation and country rock 

partial melting into the geochemical evolution of an open system magma reservoir, 

effectively linking them (Bohrson and Spera, 2001).  

This kind of model allows for the rate of assimilation and composition of the 

anatetic melt produced by the fusion of crustal material to change with time, as the 

temperature of the country rock increases by heat transfer from the magma and with the 

heat produced during crystallization (Bohrson and Spera, 2001), thus creating a more 

realistic approach than traditional AFC models that only account for mass, species and 

chemical variations at a fixed assimilation rate (DePaolo, 1981). However, EC-AFC 

models use fixed magma-mineral distribution coefficients which means that these are 

constant during the entire melt evolution, which is still not realistic. 

The EC-AFC calculations were done using an Excel spreadsheet provided by 

Spera and Bohrson (2001). The thermal and geochemical input parameters used in the 

modeling of EC-AFC at upper crustal conditions are displayed in tables 7.3 and 7.4 and 

the results on figs 7.24-25. The EC-AFC process is deduced to have occurred in the 

upper crustal levels since the most contaminated samples correspond to the more 

evolved sills, which were emplaced into the upper crust. As such, the thermal 

parameters are the same as those used for a standard upper crustal case in Bohrson and 

Spera (2001), except for the carbonate assimilant which are from Chadwick et al. 

(2007).   

As the observed magmas all show evidence for the existence of some fractional 

crystallization prior to emplacement, the compositional parameters for the initial 

parental magma have been modified so that they can represent a more primitive, 

unfractionated composition. This composition maintains the same average Sr/Nd ratio 

of the WIM’s basic rocks which will allow for some fractional crystallization to take 

place, releasing energy and heat to the country rock before the trace element values 

reach unrealistically high values in the modeled EC-AFC curves. 



 

243 
 

The initiation of assimilation of the wall rock is strongly dependent on thermal 

parameters such as the initial wall rock temperature (Ta), which can be highly variable, 

so in order to simulate a wider range of natural conditions, the calculations for the EC-

AFC model were done for several values of Ta.

As can be observed in fig. 7.24, for a contaminant with an initial temperature of 

300 ºC (Ta = 300 ºC), typical of upper crustal conditions (Bohrson and Spera, 2001), the 

EC-AFC trends defined by the OMZ granitoids could explain the isotopic signature of 

the basaltic Cascais dyke with the assimilation of ? 2% of such a contaminant, but after 

an unrealistic 94% crystallization of the initial liquid. In its turn, the assimilation of ? 

2% of the Série Negra metassediments from the OMZ could generate the isotopic 

signature observed in the Paço d’Ilhas sample with the lowest 143Nd/144Nd. However, 

this would occur at the same unrealistic 94% crystallization of the initial melt. Also, 



 

244 
 

none of these contaminants can reproduce the evolution of Sr and Nd concentrations in 

the liquid, since assimilation only takes place very late in the crystallization history. 

Assuming a higher Ta of 400 ºC, the Mesozoic carbonated contaminant shows a 

better fit with the observed magmatic evolution of the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of 

the WIM. The assimilation of approximately 6-10% of carbonate country rock is 

required in order to explain the observed signatures, after 62-68% of crystallization of 

the original basic magma. The assimilation of such a component also agrees with the 

obtained trace element data.  

For the same Ta value, none of the other possible siliceous contaminants can 

provide a good fit for the observed data, especially on the Nd vs. 143Nd/144Nd and Sr vs. 

87Sr/86Sr   diagrams (fig. 7.24). Since fusion temperatures and enthalpies are higher for 

siliceous rocks, more fractional crystallization has to take place before the silicated 

country rock receives enough energy to reach its fusion temperature. As a consequence, 

and since Nd and Sr are incompatible, the modeling process produces higher contents in 

these elements through fractional crystallization. This also means that 143Nd/144Nd and 
87Sr/86Sr values will only start changing late in the crystallization history, when the 

country rock is provived with enough energy to melt, and such timing corresponds to 

very high Nd and Sr concentrations. 

Still, if only the evolution in the isotopic compositions is considered, the 

assimilation of 0.6% granitoids from the OMZ could be responsible for the isotopic 

signature of the basaltic dyke from Cascais (fig. 7.24). The incorporation of less than 

3% of a contaminant with an isotopic signature close to the CIZ granitoids or OMZ 

Série Negra metassediments could generate the isotopic signature of the Anços sill and 

maybe even the Paço d’Ilhas sill (fig. 7.24). Yet, this would only take place after over 

90% crystallization of the initial liquid, which again seems too high for the generation 

of intermediate rocks.  

However, if higher initial assimilant temperatures are considered, the amount of 

necessary heat transfer from fractional crystallization would be smaller and the 

described curves in the element vs. isotope diagrams would probably show a better fit 

with the actual data.This can happen at higher depths in locations where long lived 

magmatism and/or extension are taking place, causing the heat flux to be higher than in 

stable regions (e.g. Jung et al., 2006; Chadwick et al., 2007), and consequentially 

increase the geothermal gradient in the area. This will mean that temperatures at mid to

246 
 

lower crustal depths can be as high or higher than 800 ºC (Sachs and Hansteen, 2000; 

Jung et al., 2006). 

For Ta = 800º C (fig. 7.25) the modeled trace element evolution seems to show a 

better fit with the observed data. Assimilation of siliceous contaminants starts at more 

reasonable amounts of crystallization (? 43%), however, the isotopic signatures of the 

contaminated melt do not show a good fit with the data, showing a large decrease in 
143Nd/144Nd for small increases in 87Sr/86Sr (fig. 7.25). 

The lack of a good fit between the EC-AFC models and the data obtained for the 

Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM can also be due to the poorly constrained 

trace element and isotopic composition of their contaminants. These can include 

siliciclastic sediments combining clasts from all of the Paleozoic terranes, and possibly 

even sediments containing mixes of silicate clasts in carbonated cement matrixes whose 

isotopic signatures should be more diverse than the simple averages presented on table 

7.4. 

Nevertheless, when compared to the carbonates, the siliceous contaminants 

would require the addition of smaller amounts of material to the initial liquid in order to 

produce the isotopic and trace element signatures observed in the more contaminated 

samples given their more radiogenic Sr and empoverished Nd isotopic signatures and 

higher contents in incompatible elements. This makes them more likely candidates to 

produce this contaminated trend than a carbonated assimilant. Also, the assimilation of 

exclusively carbonate material does not explain the variations in 87Sr/86Sr and 
143Nd/144Nd with increasing SiO2. 

The assimilation of the high amounts of carbonate, as suggested by the models 

(10-16%), would also lead to more undersaturated, CaO rich magmas (e.g. Barnes et al., 

2005; Martins et al., 2008) and the more contaminated samples in the WIM show, in 

general, the lowest CaO contents while simultaneously being the more silica saturated 

rocks present in the region, as well as the only ones showing normative quartz (0.14-

6.1% in the Paço d’Ilhas, Anços and Montelevar sills) which does not favor carbonate 

assimilation, but still allows the possibility of the existence of a carbonated siliciclastic 

contaminant. 

All this favors contamination of the more evolved WIM alkaline magmas by a 

siliceous contaminant or at least for a major contribution from such a contaminant that 

may or not have a carbonate matrix. Since the studied rocks intrude sediments derived 

from the erosion of the siliceous OMZ and CIZ terranes, these sediments seem to be the 



 

247 
 

most likely contaminants, although fusion would have to be initiated earlier than in our 

EC-AFC models, which can be achieved either by lowering the fusion temperature of 

the assimilant (e.g. by adding volatiles) or by raising the assimilant’s initial temperature.

samples with the lines of compositional variation for the EC-AFC of several different contaminants. The 

displayed numbers correspond to the percentage of mass of wall rock melt, with the amount of fractional 

crystallization that has occurred in brackets. See text for discussion. 
 

The different contamination trend observed in the samples from the Malveira da 

Serra, Lomba dos Pianos and Montelevar sills is characterized by high 87Sr/86Sr and 
143Nd/144Nd moving the samples towards the enriched quadrant (figs. 7.11-12 and 7.22-

24). Yet the basic Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da Serra sills do not show any 



 

248 
 

evidence for the existence of crustal contamination in their trace element signatures, 

although the intermediate Montelevar sill plots along the other contaminated samples 

(figs. 7.12, 7.23-25).  

Such a trend was not reproduced using any of the modeled assimilants, so it 

must have originated from a different contaminant, enriched in radiogenic Sr but either 

with a Nd isotopic signature similar to the one shown by the parental magmas to these 

sills or having very low Nd contents, meaning that the assimilation of such a material 

would not significantly affect the magma’s original 143Nd/144Nd value. This contaminant 

could correspond to a carbonate with low Nd concentrations or to a melt resulting from 

incongruent fusion of igneous or sedimentary rocks containing Rb and Sr rich phases 

such as biotite and feldspar. The fusion of such minerals would generate a melt enriched 

in radiogenic Sr but poor in Nd, driving up the Sr isotopic signature, but leaving 
143Nd/144Nd unaffected. 

The Lomba dos Pianos sill contains what appear to be plagioclase xenocrysts, it 

is possible that these might have crystallized from a magma with higher 87Sr/86Sr and 

possibly even lower 143Nd/144Nd values than the parental melts of the studied rocks. 

However, since Sr/Nd ratios in plagioclases are usually high (???
???? &gt;  ???

????, 

Bindeman et al., 1998) and these minerals can carry a significant amount of Sr, their 

presence could shift the whole rock composition towards high 87Sr/86Sr while leaving 
143Nd/144Nd and other trace elements relatively unaffected.  

On the other hand, this hypothesis requires that the plagioclase xenocrysts derive 

from disagregated wall rock assemblages, or from the mixing of liquids with different 

compositions. In the latter case, the parental and contaminating magmas would have 

homogenized and consequentially originated a hybrid isotopic signature. Since both the 

Lomba dos Pianos and Malveira da Serra sills show evidence for magma mixing, this 

could be a reasonable explanation for the existence of this isotopic trend, but it still does 

not explain why other rocks that show evidence for magma mixing do not show similar 

isotopic signatures, and cannot explain the higher 87Sr/86Sr of the Montelevar sill, since 

there is no evidence that points towards the existence of magma mixing in the 

petrogenesis of that sill.  

In summary, the more evolved, intermediate rocks of the WIM show evidence 

of contamination by a siliceous, Th, K, 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb rich, but La, Nb, 
143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb depleted assimilant.  



 

249 
 

Another trend, materialized by the Lomba dos Pianos, Malveira da Serra and 

Montelevar sills is characterized by an increase in 87Sr/86Sr and unchanged Nd and Pb 

isotopic signatures might be the result of the assimilation of carbonate material or an 

incongruent melt from Rb and Sr rich phases. 

The apparently contaminated Pb isotopic signatures of the Sintra and Sines 

igneous complexes are likely to be the result of secondary hydrothermal alteration by Pb 

rich fluids. 

The comparison between the AFC and EC-AFC models is hindered by the lack 

of knowledge concerning the composition of the contaminants and also by the high 

number of assumptions that had to be made in relation to the thermal parameters used 

for the EC-AFC models. Although EC-AFC seems to be a more complete and realistic 

method, integrating energy conservation with compositional parameters, the lack of 

available data for both these types of parameters can be a handicap while interpreting 

the obtained results. On the other hand, the more simplistic AFC curves also fail to 

reproduce most of the observed contamination trends.  

 

7.3.3 Magma mixing 

 Magma mixing between an ultrabasic to basic and a more evolved, 

phonotephritic to tephrophonolitic alkaline melt was proposed in order to justify the 

presence of reversely zoned zone clinopyroxenes, amphiboles and plagioclase in some 

of the studied intrusives (e.g. the Malveira da Serra and Lomba dos Pianos sills, the 

Ribeira d’Ilhas plugs, the lavas from the Fontanelas seamount and the Loulé 

lamprophyre C-20, section 6.2.6). 

 Given the basic to ultrabasic nature of the rocks that appear to have gone 

through magma mixing events (38 &amp;lt;SiO2% &amp;lt;46.7), the amount of intermediate alkaline 

liquid that mixed with the ultrabasic to basic magma must have been very small.  

 The range of compositions shown by liquids resulting from the mixing and 

homogenization of different proportions of two distinct components can be easily 

modeled as binary mixing, using the following equation (e.g. Faure, 1986): 

?? = ?? ? ? + ?? ? (? ? ?) 

where ??, ?? and ?? are the concentration of element X in the mixed melt (m) and in 

the components a and b, respectively, while ? is the proportion of the component a in 



 

250 
 

the mix (e.g. if ?=0.3 there is 30% of component a to 70% of component b in the mixed 

liquid). 

 

 
Fig. 7.26: Plots of SiO2 vs. several major and trace elements for the studied basic rocks. Also plotted are 

the binary mixing lines between basic and intermediate alkaline magmas. Each of the tick marks 

corresponds to an increase of 10% of a component in the mix. See text for discussion. 
 

Modeling was done using two end member compositions for either a and b, 

since the rocks that appear affected by this process range from ultrabasic lamprophyres 

in the Algarve region and hawaiites such as the Lomba dos Pianos sill. So binary 

mixing was calculated between a liquid with a composition equivalent to lamprophyre 

C-12-1(a1) and an intermediate rock from Monchique (b1) with a tephriphonolite 



 

251 
 

composition (sample b629). Binary mixing between basanite RM 69 (a2) and 

phonotephrite RM 46 from the Eiras do Faião sill (b2) was also carried out. 

Consequently, if binary mixing was an important mechanism in the petrogenesis 

of the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM, the Malveira da Serra and Lomba dos 

Pianos sills, the Ribeira d’Ilhas plugs, the lavas from the Fontanelas seamount and the 

Loulé lamprophyre C-20 would have to plot along the calculated mixing lines. 

Nonetheless, the results do not seem to reproduce the data obtained for the 

samples in a coherent manner for either major and trace elements (fig. 7.26), suggesting 

that either these were the wrong end members to use in the mixing modeling or that the 

process does not influence the major and trace element signature of these rocks. 

In summary, the relative unimportance of binary mixing as a petrogenetic 

process in the WIM seems to be supported by the lack of any linear trends forming 

among the samples that show traces of mixing, as would be expected if this process was 

of higher relevance (e.g. Geldmacher et al., 1998; Meade et al., 2010). This means that 

the assimilation and fractional crystallization processes are of much higher importance 

in the evolution of the studied rocks. 

 

7.4 Magma generation and partial melting processes 

Given the evidence presented above (section 7.1), it seems that the basic rocks in 

the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic cycle of the WIM were generated by melting of 

an enriched mantle source, which is likely to contain garnet and other minor residual 

phases in addition to olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. In this section the 

nature, melting extent, composition and mineralogy of this mantle source is evaluated.  

Since none of the samples fulfill the criteria needed to be considered primary 

mantle melts (Mg# &gt; 68, Ni &gt; 320 ppm, Cr &gt; 1000 ppm, cf. Frey et al., 1978), only the 

samples with a more primitive character and that showed only minor or no traces of 

fractionation were used (Mg# &gt; 60, Ni &gt; 50).  

 

7.4.1 Residual mantle mineralogy 

 

7.4.1.1 Characterization of residual mantle mineralogy 



 

252 
 

In fig. 7.27 we can observe several anomalies in the Primitive Mantle 

normalized multielemental diagrams for the more primitive rocks of the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline cycle of the WIM. 

The most striking features are the previously mentioned negative K, P, Zr and Hf 

anomalies, but careful observation of this diagram reveals negative anomalies in Sr for 

the Fontanelas seamount as well as small positive anomalies of the same element in 

some of the rocks from the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic activity. 

The Loulé dyke also shows a negative Ti anomaly, while some of the LVC’s rocks and 

the Foz da Fonte sills show a small spike in this same element. 

 

 
Fig. 7.27: Primitive upper mantle normalized (Palme and O’Neill, 2003)  multielemental plots for the 

primary samples. 
 

This type of anomalies can be caused by fractionation and accumulation of 

phases rich in these elements or originate from the buffering of the elemental 

concentrations by a residual mantle phase during melting events. As in most of these 

magmas, the main fractionating phases are olivine and clinopyroxene, which do not 

contain significant amounts of K, Sr, Zr and Hf, these anomalies should be related to the 

residual mineralogy present in the mantle at the time of melting. 



 

253 
 

It is therefore necessary to propose the presence of a K-rich residual mantle 

phase in order to explain the depletion in K relative to other similarly incompatible 

elements (e.g. Th, Nb, La) when normalized to primitive mantle values, resulting in the 

negative K anomalies observed in most of the basic rocks from the second pulse of Late 

Cretaceous alkaline activity in the WIM (75-72 Ma, Miranda et al., 2009, this study).  

Nb, Y and K behave incompatibly during the melting of a nominally anhydrous 

mantle, and their concentrations should decrease with increasing amounts of partial 

melting of the source, becoming less enriched in the melt as a consequence of mass 

dilution with increasing amounts of fusion. This can be seen for Y and Nb in fig. 7.28 

where, if identical source compositions are assumed, it is possible to propose that the 

Loulé lamprophyres were the result of smaller amounts of partial melting while the 

rocks from the LVC and Fontanelas seamount derived from higher degrees of melting. 

 

 
Fig. 7.28: Plots of Nb vs. Y and K/Nb for the primitive samples. 
 

Assuming that DNb ? DK and similar source compositions for all of the samples, 

K/Nb should consequentially remain constant during melting of such an anhydrous 

peridotitic source. However, in anhydrated mantle assemblage, K rich phases such as 

amphibole and phlogopite can be present, and K becomes more compatible than Nb, 

which is reflected by lower K/Nb ratios in the liquids generated from such a mantle and 

in the decreasing K/Nb values with decreasing degrees of partial melting (Class et al., 

1998).  



 

254 
 

Primitive rocks from the WIM show low K/Nb values (110 – 303) when 

compared to the primitive mantle (442, Palme and O’Neill, 2003). Also, K/Nb seems to 

increase with increasing amounts of partial melting since K becomes more incompatible 

with the increasing melting degree, which can be associated with decreasing amounts of 

the K bearing mineral in the source (fig. 7.28). 

This residual K rich phase could correspond to either amphibole (K richterite, 

kaersutite or pargasite) or phlogopite, which are common accessory phases in 

metassomatized mantle xenoliths (see Pearson et al., 2003 and references therein) and 

can fractionate incompatible elements such as K, Ba and Rb. 

K is more compatible in amphibole with relation to Rb (??
???? &gt; ???

????; 

LaTourette et al., 1995), contrary to phlogopite (??
?????&lt;?

?????; LaTourette et al., 

1995, Foley et al., 1996). So given that in the spidergram of fig. 7.27 and on fig. 7.29 K 

seems to be more compatible than Rb, and that the Rb usually shows higher primitive 

mantle normalized values than K, the residual K rich phase is likely to be an amphibole. 

 

 
Fig. 7.29: plot Rb vs. K for the primitive samples. 
 

In addition, during melting events Ba and Rb will behave differently if either 

amphibole or phlogopite are present as residual phases, given that Ba and Rb are 

compatible with respect to phlogopite (???
????? = 4.1-3.1; ???

????? = 7.5-5; Adam and 



 

255 
 

Green, 2006) but moderately incompatible in amphibole (???
???? = 0.26-0.19; ???

???? = 

0.26-0.1, Adam and Green, 2006). 

Consequently, the incompatible behavior of Ba, which decreases with decreasing 

Nb and partial melting degree, and the scattered values for Rb, Ba/Nb and Rb/Nb ratios 

with varying Nb contents (fig. 7.30) once more suggest that amphibole, rather than 

phlogopite, is the most likely residual K bearing phase, as these ratios are fractionated 

by the presence of residual phologopite during low degrees of melting (le Roex and 

Lanyon, 1998) and should increase with increasing melting degree and decreasing Nb. 

Depletion of Zr, Hf, and Ti (fig. 7.27) relative to the middle REE elements (Sm, 

Eu, and Gd) also cannot be explained by partial melting of dry garnet peridotite, given 

that the bulk partition coefficients for Zr, Hf, and Ti between garnet peridotite and 

silicate melt  are similar to the ones shown by MREE  (Salters et al., 2002). 

 

 
Fig. 7.30: plots of Nb vs. Ba, Rb, Ba/Nb and Rb/Nb for the primitive samples. 



 

256 
 

The negative anomalies in Zr and Hf observed in most of the basic samples from 

the second cycle of alkaline activity (fig. 7.30) are associated with ZrHf* below 0.75 

(where ZrHf* is defined by (Zr+Hf)N/(Nd+Sm)N, Tappe et al., 2006) which corresponds 

to the minimum value associated with samples from the first cycle, who do not show 

negative Zr and Nb anomalies. The lowest ZrHf* values are found in the Loulé dykes 

and basic rocks from Monchique (0.37-0.46), all of which have lamprophyric affinities, 

and also in the amphibole rich gabbroic rocks from the Sintra and Sines intrusions 

(0.27-0.44).  

Other basic rocks belonging to the LVC and associated dykes and sills show less 

pronounced Zr and Hf anomalies and consequently higher ZrHf* (0.51-0.76), while the 

more evolved and contaminated sills and dykes show no Zr and Hf anomaly and some 

of the highest ZrHf* (0.78-0.94). 

The negative Zr and Hf anomalies, and consequentially low ZrHf* values, in 

basic and ultrabasic rocks do not appear to be related with crustal contamination 

processes or with crystal fractionation, since the samples, excepting the Loulé dyke, do 

not show any coupled variations in ZrHf* and other HFSEs, like Nb, Ta and Ti, which 

could be indicative of crustal contamination processes, or of the fractionation and 

removal of a Ti rich oxide. 

Therefore these anomalies are considered to be primary features of these 

magmas, and associated with specific source characteristics at the time of melting. The 

aforementioned decoupling of the variations in Zr and Hf with other HFSEs in most of 

the samples also excludes the retention of these elements in a residual Ti rich oxide 

phase in the mantle such as rutile and ilmenite, since these minerals would fractionate 

all HFSE elements (McCallum and Charette, 1978; Zack and Brumm, 1998; Foley et 

al., 2000; Klemme et al., 2005). This means that it is possible that a Ti free, Zr and Hf 

rich phase existed in the mantle at the time of melting.  

The more common Zr and Hf bearing phases observed in xenoliths and as 

xenocrysts are baddeleyite (e.g. Heaman and LeCheminant, 2001) and zircon (e.g. 

Kinny and Dawson, 1992; Konzett et al., 1998). Seeing that these low ZrHf* values are 

associated with lower than unity (Th/Nb)n ratios, the negative Zr and Hf anomalies can 

be indicative of the presence of residual mantle zircon instead of baddeleyite, since the 

Zr-site in zircon has a wider size than in baddeleyite and as such can incorporate some 

Th, leading to (Th/Nb)n &amp;lt; 1 in the magmas, while Th/Nb)n &gt;  1 would be indicative of 

the presence of  baddeleyite (Kerr et al., 2010).  



 

257 
 

The fractionation or presence of residual perovskite in the mantle can be called 

upon to justify the negative Ti anomaly in the Loulé dyke. This anomaly is coupled with 

lower Zr/Nb and higher La/Nb (Nb and Zr are also compatible in perovskite: ???
??? = 

10-0.69; ???
??? = 15-2.06; ???

??? = 10-1.07 Kato et al., 1988; Liebske et al., 2005; see 

fig. 7.31).  

 

 
Fig. 7.31: Plots of Nb vs. Zr and La/Nb vs. Zr/Nb for the more primitive samples. 

 

Perovskite is a common phase in ultrabasic carbonated magmas (e.g. Rock, 

1977; Bédard, 1994; le Roex and Lanyon, 1998; Riley et al., 2003; Tappe et al., 2004), 

such as the volatile rich and carbonate bearing lamprophyres, but it has not been 

identified in the samples from the Loulé lamprophyres (see section 6.1.9). This phase 

has only rarely been recognized in mantle xenoliths (e.g. Lloyd et al., 1996; Chesley et 

al., 1999; Arzamastsev and Mitrofanov, 2009). However, the identification of this 

mineral in mantle material appears to have been wrongly attributed at times, according 

to Neal et al. (2001). Thus it seems more likely that the Ti anomaly is not related with 

residual perovskite or with the early crystallization and removal of this mineral. 

 

Amphibole and zircon, as well as other phases such as phlogopite, apatite, 

monazite, ilmenite, rutile, are common accessory phases in mantle xenolith assemblages 

that have suffered carbonatitic metassomatism in many continental alkaline provinces 

(e.g. Rudnick et al., 1993; Yaxley et al., 1998; le Roex and Lanyon, 1998; Gorring and 

7.4.1.2 On the nature of the metasomatic agent 



 

258 
 

Kay, 2000; Tappe et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2010). Negative anomalies in K, P, Zr, Hf 

and Ti in basic and ultrabasic alkaline rocks have also been associated with the 

metassomatic action of carbonatitic liquids (e.g. Zeng et al., 2010), and experimentally 

determined partition coefficients between peridotite and carbonatite melts imply that the 

carbonatites are depleted in these elements (e.g. Sweeney et al., 1995; Klemme et al., 

1995; Blundy and Dalton, 2000). Rudnick et al. (1993) associated the decrease in the 

Ti/Eu ratio with increasing La/Yb of peridotites, and in the magmas generated from 

their partial melting, with the occurrence of carbonatitic metasomatism. As can be seen 

on fig. 7.31, Ti/Eu seems to decrease on the studied samples with MgO &gt; 7, with some 

of them showing values lower than the one attributed to the primitive mantle (7901, 

Palme and O’Neill, 2003).  

 

 
Fig. 7.32: Ti/Eu vs. La/Yb and Zr/Hf for the samples with MgO &gt; 7. The values for primitive mantle 

ratios are from Palme and O’Neill (2003). 
 

Carbonatitic metasomatism can promote the stability of Ca-rich grossular 

garnets (Pfänder et al. 2007; Martins et al., 2010) which have  ???
??? &gt; ???

??? &gt; 1 (van 

Westrenem et al., 2001) consequentially causing lower Zr/Hf ratios in magmas 

generated from sources metasomatized by carbonatitic liquids containing grossular. 

However, in the majority of cases, relatively high Zr/Hf (36.2-47.9 in the studied 

samples), above the ratio shown by the primitive mantle (? 36, Palme and O’Neill, 

2003), coupled with the lower Ti/Eu values (fig. 7.32) and high La/Yb are interpreted as 

a fingerprint of the action of carbonatite metasomatism (e.g. Dupuy et al., 1992; Ionov 



 

259 
 

et al., 1993; Rudnick et al., 1993; Yaxley et al., 1998; Tappe et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 

2010).  

From the observation of figure 7.32 it is also noticeable that the Foz da Fonte 

sill, which formed during the first pulse of Late Cretaceous igneous alkaline activity, 

does not appear to have suffered the effects of carbonatite metasomatism, which is 

expected since the metasomatic trace element signature is only present in samples from 

the second pulse.  

The combination of the increase in Ti/Eu and decrease in Zr/Hf with decreasing 

Th (fig. 7.33) and increasing degree of melting indicates that the carbonatite 

metasomatized mantle is preferentially sampled in the initial stages of melting, as 

anticipated, since carbonation lowers the solidus of mantle peridotite. Consequentially, 

the carbonated mantle domains will melt before anything else and the metasomatic 

signature of the resulting melts will be more evident for melting events characterized by 

low degrees of melting (see also Mata, 1996; Mata et al., 1998). As the degree of 

melting increases, unmetasomatized parts of the mantle can start to melt and the 

carbonatitic signature becomes progressively diluted within increasing contributions 

from non metasomatized domains to the magma.

The imprint of a metasomatic event by a carbonatite liquid can by itself generate 

the observed trace element patterns, with its negative anomalies in K, P, Zr, Hf and 

sometimes even Ti, but it can also lead to the formation of the minerals previously 



 

260 
 

identified as being responsible by the retention of these elements, for example 

amphibole (e.g. Kinny and Dawson, 1992; Yaxley et al., 1998, Zaccarini et al., 2004). 

The crystallization of zircon can also be associated with mantle carbonate given that 

zircons found in MARID (Mica, Amphibole, Rutile, Ilmenite and Diopside) xenoliths 

appear to have formed from interaction with carbonated and K rich silicic liquids 

(Kinny and Dawson, 1992; Sweeney et al., 1993; Konzett et al., 1998, 2000; Dawson et 

al., 2000). 

The melting of carbonated peridotite will at first generate carbonatitic melts, but 

the nature of the generated liquids will progress gradually towards silica undersaturated 

siliceous compostions with increasing melting degree (e.g. Thibault et al., 1992; Hirose, 

1997; Gudfinnsson and Presnall, 2005; Dasgupta et al., 2007).  

Silicate and carbonate liquids can be found in close association in some mantle 

xenoliths (e.g. Yaxley et al., 1991; Neumann et al., 2002; Martins et al., 2010). In some 

cases, mixtures of these two liquids can occur as silicic carbonatite or carbonate bearing 

silicate melts (e.g. Neumann et al., 2002; Sisson et al., 2009). Therefore, it is likely that 

the source rocks for the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism in the WIM underwent 

both carbonated and siliceous metasomatism, similarly to what has been proposed by 

Dixon et al. (2008) for the rejuvenated stage lavas of Niihau in Hawaii. Also, the 

metasomatic episodes involving carbonated melts are likely to be volumetrically 

restricted due to the consumption of the small volumes of carbonatitic liquid during 

metasomatic decarbonation reactions (e.g enstatite 4MgSiO3 + dolomite CaMg(CO3)2 = 

forsterite 2Mg2SiO4+ diopside CaMgSi2O6 + 2CO2; Yaxley, 1991). 

Pilet et al. (2008) have recently proposed and alternative mechanism for the 

generation of enriched undersaturated alkaline rocks, involving volatile rich (H2O+CO2) 

basic alkaline siliceous liquids metasomatizing the lithosphere and forming hornblendite 

and hornblende clinopyroxenite veins (e.g. Coltorti et al., 2004; Pilet et al., 2008). In 

fact, experiemental work has shown that the partial melting of such metasomatic veins, 

along with interacting and additional melting of the surrounding peridotite, can be 

invoked to explain the major and trace element trace element concentrations of basic 

undersaturated alkaline magmas with compositions ranging from nephelinite to alkali 

basalt (fig. 7.36, Pilet et al., 2008, 2010).  

Those results can also reproduce most of the features observed in spidergrams 

common in this type of magmas and found on the studied rocks (negative anomalies in 

K, P, Zr and Hf and pronounced enrichments in LREEs and Nb, fig. 7.34), except for 



 

261 
 

the negative anomaly in Ti and low Ti/Eu values found in the Loulé lamprophyre and in 

other ultrabasic to basic intraplate alkaline provinces (e.g. Tappe et al., 2004, 2006; 

Androkinov and Foley, 2002; Zeng et al., 2010). This is because the magmas generated 

by this kind of source are very Ti rich, given the large amounts of Ti bearing amphibole 

present in the source. 

 

 
Fig. 7.34: Primitive upper mantle normalized (Palme and O’Neill, 2003)  multielemental plots for the 

more primitive samples of the WIM and for the experimental melts obtained from hornblendite and 

hornblendite + peridotite sources by Pilet et al. (2008). 
 

Other possible sources for alkaline magmatism, including silica deficient 

carbonated eclogite and garnet pyroxenite, have also been proposed as possible sources 

for basic alkaline magmas, but the melts produced from these sources are generally too 

poor in alkalis (Hirschman et al., 2003; Kogiso et al., 2003; Kogiso and Hirschman 

2006) and cannot explain the negative Ti anomalies and high Zr/Hf ratios commonly 

observed in these magmas (Zeng et al., 2010) and in some of the Late Cretaceous 

alkaline rocks studied in this work. 

In summary, trace element abundances and ratios point towards a metasomatic 

enrichment of the source of the alkaline magmatism present in the WIM. The 



 

262 
 

composition of such a metasomatic agent is likely to be gradational, from a carbonatitic 

to a volatile rich siliceous melt. However, the high Zr/Hf and low Ti/Eu point towards 

an important carbonatitic contribution. Carbonatite and silicate melts possess different 

melt structures, owing to having ???
??and O2- as the main coordinating or complexing 

anion (Klemme et al., 1995; Blundy and Dalton, 2000) and will therefore show different 

bulk distribution coefficients for certain elements (see also Martins et al., 2010). 

Experimental studies show that carbonatite melts show marked depletions in Ti in 

relation to LREE and MREE, resulting in low Ti/Eu (e.g. Klemme et al., 1995; 

Dasgupta et al., 2009). On the other hand, D values for Ti between garnet peridotite and 

silicate melts are similar to the ones shown by MREE (Salters et al., 2002) and generate 

higher Ti/Eu, as the ones seen in experimental results by Pilet et al. (2008). 

Overall, high Zr/Hf and low Ti/Eu are diagnostic of an important carbonatitic 

component in the metasomatic agent that affected the source of some of the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM, resulting in the imprint of its trace element 

signature in the metasomatized mantle. 

Evidence seems to point to carbonatitic and volatile rich (H2O+CO2) siliceous 

liquids, both of which can be generated progressively by decompression melting of a 

common, ascending carbonated peridotite (e.g. Gudfinnsson and Presnall, 2005; 

Dasgupta et al., 2006). As these two kinds of metasomatic agents have been previously 

identified in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (e.g. Dautria et al., 1992; Woodland 

et al., 1996), it is likely that they could have both acted in the mantle underneath the 

West Iberian Margin producing heterogenous mantle domains. 

 

The presence of metasomatic residual amphibole is not compatible with the 

temperature conditions that characterize the convecting asthenosphere or associated 

with mantle plumes (e.g. Class and Goldstein, 1997), which implies that the magmas 

with negative K anomalies were at least in equilibrium with cooler, amphibole bearing 

lithospheric mantle. 

7.4.1.3 Asthenospheric vs. Lithospheric contributions: constraints from residual mantle 

mineralogy 

However, the unradiogenic Sr and radiogenic Nd isotopic signature of these 

magmas is compatible with a sublithospheric source. This depleted signature contrasts 

with the observed trace element enrichment and indicates that the source must have 

been subject to a metasomatic event which took place shortly before the generation and 



 

263 
 

emplacement of these alkaline magmas, not giving them time to evolve into distinct 

isotopic signatures by radioactive decay as a reservoir separated from the convecting 

asthenosphere. The nature of this asthenospheric or lithospheric mantle source will be 

discussed in further detail in section 7.5. 

It should be noted that the nature of the lithospheric mantle in the WIM can 

nevertheless be quite similar to the underlying asthenosphere.  

As was previously discussed, rifting in the Lusitanian basin ended before the 

onset of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism (e.g. Rasmussen et al., 1998; 

Kullberg, 2000; Kullberg et al., 2010). After the continental break-up and the initiation 

of seafloor spreading, the lithosphere and asthenosphere will return to thermal 

equilibrium (e.g. Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004). The thermal anomalies induced by the 

upwelling asthenosphere during rifting will decay and stabilize to 65% of their 

maximum intensity after 60 Ma in the case of mantle plumes. For margins where 

amagmatic rifting took place, such as WIM, that value is reached in shorter amounts of 

time (Ziegler and Cloetingh, 2004). 

This means that by the Late Cretaceous, which is approximately 25 Ma after the 

end of rifting and oceanic break-up (at 124-118 Ma, e.g. Sibuet et al., 2007), the 

lithosphere of the newly formed passive West Iberian Margin could have been 

constituted by a mix of previously existing Paleozoic subcontinental lithosphere with 

Mesozoic asthenosphere accreted by conductive cooling. Subsequently, in the Late 

Cretaceus the lower part of the lithosphere in the WIM should then have a Mesozoic age 

and show chemical characteristics similar to the depleted convective asthenosphere (e.g. 

Wilson, 1993). 

Later, during the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle, this relatively young 

lithospheric domain could be the site of metasomatism by carbonated and hydrated 

silicated melts derived from low degrees of melting of a carbonated peridotite 

eventually present in the asthenosphere or in an upwelling mantle plume, similarly to 

what is proposed by Dasgupta et al. (2006) for oceanic settings. However, the thicker 

continental lithosphere would prevent the formation of the more silica rich melts 

produced in the spinel stability field that are sampled in oceanic areas with a thinner 

lithosphere. It would only allow for the generation of liquids resulting from small melt 

fractions at higher depths, and consequentially in equilibrium with stable garnet. These 

incompatible element enriched low degree melts would react with the lithosphere and 

form discrete veins that might contain amphibole, zircon and other metasomatic 



 

264 
 

minerals, and also have a lower solidus than the surrounding lithosphere due to their 

hydrated and/or carbonated nature.  

These veined domains could therefore be easily fused during a subsequent event, 

and the enriched melts generated by their fusion could mix with more depleted liquids 

resulting from the partial melting of the asthenosphere or surrounding lithosphere, 

creating the observed trace element and isotopic signatures. The metasomatic 

component in the final signatures, will be more or less evident depending on the 

proportion of melt generated from metasomatic material and from the more depleted 

asthenosphere in the final melt. 

However, this later melting event had to be triggered by a thermal perturbation 

of the lithosphere, either by the arrival of hotter mantle from a plume or convecting cell 

or by adiabatic decompression associated with lithospheric extension. As the WIM was 

not under extension during the Late Cretaceous, the first option seems the more likely. 

The mineral chemistry data for the xenocrysts and xenoliths presented on section 

6.2 can be used as evidence for the presence of clinopyroxene, amphibole and apatite 

rich domains that could be a result of mantle metasomatism by silicic carbonated liquids 

in the subcontinental mantle lithosphere (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005; O’Reilly and Griffin, 

2000). However, the pressure and consequentially the depth at which those minerals 

formed is still fairly unconstrained and one cannot argue without reasonable doubt that 

these processes took place in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle or in the lower 

crust. 

 

7.4.2 Estimates for the degree of melting 

Even though all of the studied samples are of alkaline nature and share some 

compositional affinities (see section 7.1), the variability detected in terms of trace 

element and even isotopic signatures indicates that the source of this Cretaceous 

alkaline event cannot be considered to be homogeneous. This must be taken into 

account when reading the next discussion, where source homogeneity can be implied. 

Even if such an assumption is not strictly correct, the common characteristics 

shown by the studied samples are thought to validate the following discussion, in a 

sense that the results obtained are suitable at least for comparison purposes. 

The relative amount of mantle partial melting that occurred in order to form the 

more primitive WIM magmas can be estimated by plotting a very incompatible element, 



 

265 
 

such as Th, versus a ratio of two other incompatible elements (e.g. Sm/Nd, Hf/Th) with 

the less incompatible of the two as the numerator. These very incompatible elements 

(Th, Nd) have very high affinities with the liquid and are enriched in small melt 

fractions in comparison to the other less incompatible elements. As the degree of 

melting of the source increases, concentration of the very incompatible elements will 

tend to decrease as they become more diluted in the melt.  

 

 
Fig. 7.35: Plot of Th vs. Hf/Th and Sm/Nd for the samples that represent more primitive magmas. Th 

decreases and incompatible trace element ratios increase with increasing amounts of partial melting of the 

source. 

 

From fig. 7.35, we can suggest that the Loulé lamprophyric dyke is the result of 

the smallest amount of partial melting, while basalts from the LVC and Fontanelas 

seamount, the Foz da Fonte sill, the Cascais dykes and the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug all seem 

to be the product of similar, higher amounts of partial melting. 

These conclusions are supported by fig. 7.36 where the Loulé dyke shows the 

higher La, La/Yb and Tb/Yb, in accordance with an origin from small degrees of partial 

melting, which progressively increases towards the rocks from the LVC, Fontanelas 

seamount, Foz da Fonte sill and Cascais basaltic dyke. 

Garnets have high D for HREE (e.g. Adam and Green, 2006), and since all the 

more primitive samples show a strong REE fractionation, as was observed in fig. 7.9, 

with the samples having high LREE/HREE ((La/Yb)N 49 – 15.4) and MREE/HREE 

fractionation ((Tb/Yb)N 3.1 – 2.7) ratios, it is considered that melting took place in the 

presence of residual garnet.  



 

266 
 

 

 
Fig. 7.36: Plots of La vs. La/b and La/Yb vs. Tb/Yb for the samples that represent primary magmas. F is 

the degree of partial melting of the mantle source. It increases with decreasing La/Yb and La. 
 

As a mantle peridotite phase, garnet is stable at depths higher than 60 km where 

it occurs along with spinel up to 70 km and as the only Al rich phase from that depth 

onwards (e.g. Shen and Forsyth, 1995), meaning that the depth of melting for the 

alkaline rocks of the WIM was at least 60 km and likely higher.  

Also, in fig. 7.36 it is observed that La and La/Yb, as well as Tb/Yb decrease 

with increasing degree of melting. La and Tb become more diluted in melts that result 

from higher partial melting fractions and furthermore because the amount of residual 

garnet in the mantle also decreases as the mineral is consumed during fusion, leading to 

a decrease of Yb retention in residual garnet and consequentially to lower La, La/Yb 

and Tb/Yb values. 

The amount of partial melting taking place at the source of a certain magmatic 

event can also be quantitatively determined using the variation of the concentration of 

incompatible trace elements with increasing amounts of melting.  

In this case, modeling was done using equilibrium batch melting. Batch or 

equilibrium batch melting assumes that the melt is continually reacting and equilibrating 

with the solid residue until extraction from the source takes place, and provides good 

results when compared to other mantle melting models (e.g. Feingenson et al., 1996; 

Spath et al., 2001). The equation that governs such a behavior was determined by Shaw 

(1970): 

 



 

267 
 

??
?

???
=  

?
?? + ?(? ? ??)

 

 

where ??
?  is the concentration of element i in the magmatic liquid, ???  is the 

concentration of the same element in the source rock, F is the amount of partial melt 

and ?? the bulk distribution coefficient between the residual solid and the magma 

(??? = ??
???????? × ????  ?). 

 In order to account for different melt contributions from the individual solid 

mineral phases in proportions that are different from the ones in which they are present 

in the source assemblage, the batch melting equation was rewritten as follows by Shaw 

(1970): 

??
?

???
=  

?
?? + ?(? ? ?)

 

where P is the bulk distribution coefficient for the minerals that contribute to the melt 

(? = ??? × ??, where ?? is the normative weight fraction of a certain mineral in the 

melt and ?? is the mineral-melt distribution coefficient for a given trace element for 

that same mineral). 

REEs were used to constrain the amounts of partial melting that took place in the 

source of the more primitive WIM magmas (Mg# &gt; 60, Ni &gt; 150). Since chondrite 

normalized patterns for REEs are strongly dependent on source composition and 

mineralogy, as well as on the degree of partial melting of that same source, the shape of 

those patterns will be controlled by the occurrence of phases whose presence is in its 

turn controlled by pressure/depth, such as spinel and garnet (e.g. Ellam, 1992; Kerr, 

1994).  

Only the more primitive and uncontaminated magma compositions were used 

for the elaboration of these models since these went through minimal amounts of 

fractional crystallization and therefore their REE concentrations have not been 

significantly affected by this process. For this reason the basaltic dyke from Cascais 

(sample RM 64) had to be left out of the process, since it appears to have been 

contaminated by crustal material (see section 7.3.2), although it is a fairly basic and 

undifferentiated rock.

Despite of the uncertainties associated with the assumptions made regarding the 

trace element and mineralogical composition of the source and the weight contributions 

of its phases to the final melt, batch melt modeling of REE has often been used to 

estimate the amounts of partial melting that took place at the mantle source (e.g. 

Feigenson et al., 1996; Spath et al., 2001), showing good correlation with the depths and 

degrees of melting inferred independently from different methods. 

In addition to garnet, the presence of a K-rich amphibole must be added to the 

residual mineralogy of the source mantle while melting was taking place for some of the 

samples belonging to the second phase of Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism. The 

need for the presence of amphibole in the mantle source has been discussed in detail in 

section 7.4.1.

The obtained results can be observed in figs. 7.37 and 7.38 and the modeling 

parameters (source composition, used D values and source mineralogy and melting 

modes) are displayed in tables 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7. 

Several independent sources had to be modeled in order to reproduce the 

chondrite normalized REE patterns presented by the analyzed samples. All these 

sources are LREE enriched and contain residual garnet. Amphibole was present in the 

modeled sources 1, 2 and 3 but not 4 since this last source was used to model the Foz da 

Fonte sill where residual amphibole is not supposed to be present.  

The results indicate that the ultramafic Loulé lamprophyres are derived from 

very low amounts of partial melting (1-2%) of a more REE enriched source, with higher 

amounts of residual garnet and amphibole (fig. 7.37).  

The source for the remaining Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the second pulse 

of magmatism present in the WIM is less REE enriched, contains smaller amounts of 

garnet and amphibole (table 7.6) and requires higher amounts of partial melting (3-6%) 

in order to generate the observed REE patterns in these samples.  

The REE contents of the basaltic Cascais dyke (RM 64) cannot be modeled 

using any of these sources and would require an even more depleted source, with 

different melting modes (fig. 7.37). They are also positioned slightly off the modeled 

trends in fig. 7.39. Both these factors argue that small amounts of contamination by 

crustal materials led to small but significant changes in its REE concentrations.

The REE patterns of the Foz da Fonte sill were modeled from the partial melting 

of 4-5% of an amphibole free garnet peridotite very similar to the one that generated the 

rocks from the LVC (source 3, table 7.6).

The plotting of La vs. La/Yb and La/Yb vs. Sm/Yb of the modeled melting 

curves with the data obtained for the more primary samples (fig. 7.39)  also agrees with 

the results proposed above, reinforcing the idea that the parameters used for the 

modeling are reasonable. The minor differences observed between sources 2 and 3 

indicate that amphibole plays a minor role in fractionating REE since these sources are 

nearly equivalent except source 3, which lacks amphibole. 

In fig. 7.39 are melts derived from sources equivalent to 1 and 2 but representing 

a shallower peridotite, with spinel instead of garnet are also plotted. It is clear from the 

trends generated by the melting of spinel bearing sources that garnet has to be present in 

order to explain the observed REE fractionation, since the melts from spinel peridotites 

show much lower La/Yb and Sm/Yb values.

 7.5 Nature of the mantle source for the Late Cretaceous alkaline 

magmatism in the WIM 
 

In this section, the geochemical information compiled in this work and presented 

by other authors who worked in the region will be discussed in order to try and evaluate 

the nature of the mantle source that originated the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of 

the WIM. 

 
7.5.1 Lithospheric contribution to the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of the 

WIM 

 

As was documented in the previous sections, the mantle source of the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM shows a complex history involving 

metasomatic enrichment by a volatile rich carbonated to siliceous melt. 

However, if one considers the age corrected isotopic compositions of the 

uncontaminated samples (87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7 – 3.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-
19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00), these seem to show a 

relatively small compositional range. Given the relatively large time span (94-72 Ma) of 

this magmatic episode, the composition of the mantle of the WIM can be considered as 

being reasonably stable and homogenous over that time period, which covered two 

distinct pulses of  magmatic activity (Miranda et al., 2009; this study). These values are 

also within the range of compositions previously obtained for the Monchique alkaline 

complex (fig. 7.40) by Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997). 

The isotopic signatures shown by the samples of the alkaline cycle of the 

Mesozoic magmatic activity in the WIM are notoriously different from the ones that 

characterize the mantle sources of the previous tholeiitic and transitional cycles, which 

are of Early Jurassic and Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous ages, respectively. 

The tholeiitic cycle (? 198 Ma, Veratti et al., 2007) is part of the Central Atlantic

et al., 2008; fig. 7.40) that have been attributed to a high contribution from the 

lithospheric mantle (Martins et al., 2008) along with the Central Atlantic Plume material 

as sources for these melts (e.g. Cebriá et al., 2003). 

The transitional cycle (141-146 Ma, Grange et al., 2008; Alves, 2010) outcrops 

only within the Lusitanian Basin and also possesses a distinct trace element and isotopic 

signature, with intermediate values between the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism 

and the previous tholeiitic event (87Sr/86Sri 0.70403 to 0.706, ?Ndi -3.16 to 0.64; 
206Pb/204Pb 18.418-18.978, 207Pb/204Pb 15.595-15.632, 208Pb/204Pb 37.106-38.484; 

Grange et al., 2008, Alves, 2010; fig. 7.40). The isotopic and geochemical signature of 

the magmas from this cycle has been interpreted as to reflect partial melting of enriched 

metasomatized mantle domains, with the heat required for their fusion being provided 

by the ascending asthenosphere which occurred as a consequence of progressive 

extension in the Lusitanian basin during the last rifting phases (Grange et al., 2008; 

Alves, 2010). 

From the tholeiitic (Lower Jurassic) to the transitional (Upper Jurassic/Lower 

Cretaceous) and finally to the alkaline cycle (Late Cretaceous) there seems to be a trend 

towards a more depleted Sr and Nd isotopic signature with time (figs. 7.40-41), which 

contrasts with the progressive enrichment in the trace element abundances and 

increasingly radiogenic Pb that is simultaneously observed (fig. 7.40-41). 

Grange et al. (2010) sampled and analyzed the Sintra, Sines and Monchique 

complexes as well as the Paço d’Ilhas sill from the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle. 

Based on whole rock trace element data and isotopic analysis from feldspar (Pb and Sr) 

and zircon (Hf) separates, these authors proposed a sublithospheric enriched DMM 

source that produced melts that were subsequently contaminated with variable amounts 

of more radiogenic subcontinental lithospheric mantle. 

These authors assumed that their isotopic and trace element data did not reflect 

any kind of contamination from crustal lithologies and therefore was representative of 

the mantle sources of these magmas. This interpretation included even the more evolved 

samples, which in this case include granites and microgranites (Sintra), syenites (Sines) 

and nepheline syenites (Monchique). It is difficult to explain the generation of large 

volumes of felsic magma only by fractional crystallization of basic magmas in upper 

crustal settings without the occurrence of any kind of contamination, as they proposed 

for the alkaline complexes of Sintra, Sines and Monchique. In these complexes, the 

more evolved rocks make up most of the outcropping area, while the basic rocks are 



 

276 
 

much rarer at the surface (e.g. Matos Alves, 1964; Canilho, 1972; Clavijo and 

Valadares, 2003) and do not seem to be compensated by extensive volumes of mafic 

cumulates at depth (e.g. Kullberg et al., 2010 for Sintra). Furthermore, the isotopic data 

for these more evolved rocks from (Grange et al., 2010) plots along the contaminated 

trend defined for the more evolved rocks identified in this study (see section 7.3.2 and 

figs. 7.39 and 7.19-24), towards compositions that are more enriched in 87Sr/86Sri and 
207Pb/204Pb but that show lower 206Pb/204Pb and  208Pb/204Pb.

magmatic activity present in the WIM. Data for the alkaline cycle corresponds to the uncontaminated

The increases in K/Nb, Th/La and coupled decrease in Nb/U with increasing 

silica contents seen in the more evolved and contaminated rocks in this study (see 



 

277 
 

section 7.3.2, fig. 7.21), also take place in the acid rocks sampled by Grange et al. 

(2010), thus pointing again towards important contamination by silica rich lithologies 

associated with the generation of these rocks (fig. 7.42). The marked positive Pb and 

negative Nb anomalies seen in the multielemental plots for the more evolved rocks (see 

fig. 4 in Grange et al., 2010) reinforce the conclusion that, in opposition to what is 

proposed by these authors, such rocks formed from magmas that have assimilated 

significant amounts of crustal contaminant(s) and therefore their isotopic signatures 

cannot be used to make inferences about the nature of their mantle source.

278 
 

Since the samples from the Sines and Sintra “gabbro” analyzed by Grange et al. 

(2010) actually correspond to diorites which are already slightly contaminated (see 

section 7.3.2), only the samples from the Monchique gabbro can be considered as 

representatives of uncontaminated, but more or less fractionated mantle melts. 

Meanwhile the other “gabbros”, the Paço d’Ilhas sill and the evolved rocks from the 

alkaline complexes all show evidence for important crustal contamination. The values 

reported by Grange et al. (2010) for the uncontaminated Monchique gabbro are 
87Sr/86Sri = 0.70356, 206Pb/204Pb = 19.237, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.555 and 208Pb/204Pb = 

38.918, which is within the range reported for the uncontaminated samples from the 

WIM reported in this work and by Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997), except for slightly 

lower 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb (fig. 7.40). These authors attribute the isotopic 

signatures described for Monchique to an enriched DMM component derived from a 

deep, sublithospheric OIB like source that might correspond to a mantle plume or to the 

ambient astenospheric mantle enriched by a mantle plume. 

The apparent decoupling of the Sr, Pb and Hf isotopic ratios detected by Grange 

et al. (2010) in the samples from Sintra is puzzling, but can be tentatively explained by 

the mixed effects of the contaminated nature of the magmas with the late stage 

hydrothermal event that affect this complex (see sections 6.1 and 7.3.2). Crustal 

contamination would lead to an increase in 87Sr/86Sr, 207Pb/204Pb coupled with a 

decrease in 206Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb and ?Hf. However, some samples seem to show low 
87Sr/86Sr, high 207Pb/204Pb and variable, but still positive ?Hf.  On section 7.2.2 the 

higher 206Pb/204Pb, and lower 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb shown in the whole rock 

analysis of the Sintra gabbros were attributed to the effects of late stage hydrothermal 

alteration by a Pb rich fluid. This hydrothermal alteration affects the feldspars and 

plagioclases more clearly (see section 6.1) than the other phases and so could be 

responsible for the more radiogenic Pb signature seen in some of the feldspar separates 

analyzed by Grange et al. (2010). However, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios are low and the 

metasomatizing fluids are not thought to contain unradiogenic Sr (see section 7.3.2).  

The low 87Sr/86Sri in the feldspar separates from the more evolved rocks 

analyzed by Grange et al. (2010) might correspond to an artifact generated by 

overcorrection for the Rb-Sr decay in samples with high Rb/Sr ratios (1.56-5.77 for the 

more evolved rocks while only 0.002 to 0.2 in the basic to intermediate rocks). Any 

small imprecisions in the analysis of trace element concentrations in high Rb/Sr rocks or 

minerals leads to large error propagation in the calculation of age corrected Sr isotope 



 

279 
 

data and therefore produces less reliable 87Sr/86Sri values. On fig 7.43 the calculated 
87Sr/86Sri are plotted along with the repective error bars, and it is possible to observe that 

the two granite samples from Sintra, (PT9A, alkali granite and PT5A, microgranite, 

Grange et al., 2010), display the largest error bars for the calculated 87Sr/86Sri and could 

therefore have reasonably higher isotopic ratios than the ones they are attributed in 

Grange et al. (2010). Such hypothetical higher 87Sr/86Sri would be more compatible with 

their contaminated nature. 

 

 
Fig. 7.43: Plot of age corrected Sr isotope ratios vs. Rb/Sr for feldspar separates analyzed by Grange et al. 
(2010), with error bars representing the propagated error using a ± 5 % analytical uncertainty in Rb and Sr 
determinations. The data shows that the uncertainties in 87Sr/86Sri increase with higher the Rb/Sr ratios. 

 

A north to south increase in 206Pb/204Pb with simultaneous decrease in 87Sr/86Sri 

and 207Pb/204Pb in the occurrences studied by Grange et al. (2010) was interpreted by 

these authors as reflecting the progressive north to south increase in the contribution of 

an asthenospheric component. However, this trend is not observed on the data for 

uncontaminated rocks, for both the onshore and offshore occurrences (fig. 7.44). 

Instead, the samples show considerable scatter of isotopic ratios at whatever latitude 

they occur, arguing against a larger lithospheric contribution in the northern occurrences 

or significant variation of contribution from different components with latitude.

the WIM, including the Ormonde seamount (Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997) and the Madeira-Tore rise 

(Geldmacher et al., 2006; Merle et al., 2006). 
 

Also, the use of the Cabo Ortegal Complex by Grange et al (2010) as a proxy for 

the subcontinental lithospheric mantle composition of the WIM can be questioned since 

it corresponds to a metamorphosed Lower Paleozoic ophiolite with back-arc affinities, 

and that shows signs of modification by subduction processes (Santos Zalduegui et al., 

1996; Martinez et al., 2007). Such does not seem an adequate proxy to compare with the 

compositional characteristics with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle from a 



 

281 
 

Mesozoic passive margin such as the WIM. Instead, data from exposed sublithospheric 

mantle rocks along peridotite ridges in the Galicia banks and Iberia abyssal plain a seem 

to be more adequate proxy, but these show a more depleted trace element and Nd 

isotope signature and enriched Sr compositions (e.g. Beard et al., 2002; Chazot et al., 

2005, fig.7.40). However, the Pb isotopic signature of these rocks remains 

undetermined except for some late pegmatitic veins of Cretaceous age that intrude those 

peridotites, which show rather unradiogenic lead (206Pb/204Pb 18.65, 207Pb/204Pb 15.48 

and 208Pb/204Pb 38.3, Beard et al., 2002) and cannot be the source of the old lithospheric 

component identified in the WIM by Grange et al. (2010) and Merle et al. (2006). 

Other authors have argued that basic alkaline intraplate magmas enriched in 

trace elements and with radiogenic Pb and Nd relatively unradiogenic Sr can result from 

the melting of old recycled metasomatized lithospheric mantle (e.g. Pilet et al., 2005), 

of subcontinental lithospheric mantle metasomatized during previous subduction events 

(Finn et al., 2005; Panter et al., 2006), or even of veins that resulted from metasomatism 

contemporaneous of rifting and asthenospheric ascension that created high U/Pb 

domains (Nardini et al., 2009) 

An origin within the subcontinental lithosphere for the Late Cretaceous alkaline 

magmas of the WIM can be rejected since the known isotopic composition for the 

peridotites and metasomatic veins of the continental lithosphere sampled in the Iberian 

Abyssal plain are markedly different from the studied magmas (fig. 7.40, Schärer et al., 

1995; Seifert et al., 1997; Charpentier et al., 1998; Beard et al., 2002; Chazot et al., 

2005). The metasomatic events recorded in these peridotites seem to be caused by the 

percolations of depleted asthenospheric melts (Charpentier et al., 1998; Beard et al., 

2002; Chazot et al., 2005) mostly during the Cretaceous (138-122 Ma, Féraud et al., 

1996; Schärer et al., 1995; Schärer et al., 2000; Beard et al., 2002), i. e. they are 

contemporaneous of the last extensional phases on the WIM and appear to be marking 

the transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading. The products from this 

metasomatic event did not have enough time to evolve the radiogenic Pb signatures 

observed in the studied samples, as can be confirmed by the unradiogenic Pb isotope 

ratios of the gabbroic pegmatitic intrusions in site 1070 of ODP leg 173 (Beard et al., 

2002). 

An earlier phase of magmatism that might have affected the lithospheric mantle 

of the WIM is recorded in the exposed lithospheric section exposed in the ridges, but it 

is thought to correspond to underplating under the lower crust during a late Variscan 



 

282 
 

extensional phase at ? 270 Ma (Whitmarsh and Wallace, 2001). However, both these 

metasomatic phases do not show the trace element and isotopic enriched characteristics 

that characterize the source of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas. 

From the discussion above, a significant contribution of an ancient lithospheric 

component in the source of the alkaline rocks from the WIM can be discarded, although 

it is possible that there is an input from the subcontinental lithosphere that has been 

recently metasomatized by enriched sublithospheric melts, as seems to be indicated by 

the presence of residual amphibole and of a carbonatite metasomatic signature (see 

section 7.4.1). 

 

7.5.2 Pb isotopic signatures in seamounts and the effects of seawater alteration and 

crustal contamination 

 

Merle et al. (2006) proposed an asthenospheric source with an OIB like 

composition to justify the composition of the seamounts of the northern part of the 

MTR (Madeira-Tore Rise) and also identified a lithospheric source component enriched 

in 207Pb/204Pb. In this study, as in Grange et al. (2010), Pb isotopic data was acquired on 

plagioclase and feldspar separates, which in the case of Merle et al. (2006), are assumed 

not to contain any initial U and to therefore reflect the initial Pb isotopic composition of 

the melt. This assumption might not be accurate in the case of the onshore samples due 

to the hydrothermal alteration event discussed above, and also in the case of the samples 

from the MTR due to the important seawater alteration.  

Seawater alteration might remove common magmatic lead (Michard and 

Albaréde, 1985; Hauff et al., 2000) while simultaneously introducing some Pb from 

seawater (You et al., 1996) in the feldspars and plagioclases. If this alteration process 

occurs at relatively high temperatures (i.e. shortly after extrusion), it can be responsible 

for the partial albitization of the feldspars. The albitic structures can take up more 

secondary U and Pb (Housh and Bowring, 1991; You et al., 1996) and therefore 

contribute to a higher time integrated Pb isotopic signature, especially if no age 

correction is applied. Otherwise, radiogenic Pb can accumulate in cracks and grain 

boundaries (Ludwig and Silver, 1977; Housh and Bowring, 1991) or be present in 

oxide, sulphide or other high U/Pb mineral inclusions in the feldspars (Ludwig and 

Silver, 1977; Housh and Bowring, 1991; Bryce and DePaolo, 2004). Although the 



 

283 
 

excess Pb in crystal cracks and boundaries might be easily removed during leaching, if 

there is an important albitic component or inclusions of high U/Pb minerals in these 

plagioclase and feldspars, there might be an important excess Pb component that Merle 

et al. (2006) did not consider. 

The suggestion that at least part of the anomalous Pb ratios in MTR samples are 

the result of alteration processes is reinforced by the observation that for the same 

seamount (Teresa, in Geldmacher et al., 2006 and Gago Coutinho, in Merle et al., 2006) 
207Pb/204Pb values are substantially different, being lower in the leached whole rock data 

set (207Pb/204Pb 15.589-15.594, Geldmacher et al., 2006) and showing higher values in 

the dataset based on feldspar and plagioclase separates (207Pb/204Pb 15.661, Merle et al., 

2006). 

Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that the simple addition of radiogenic Pb 

from seawater will not produce the observed anomalous radiogenic Pb isotopic 

signatures in the feldspars from the MTR, since North Atlantic seawater isotopic 

signature tends to show lower 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb for the higher 207Pb/204Pb 

values (fig. 7.39, von Blackenburg et al., 1996; O’Nions et al., 1998; Abouchami et al., 

1999), while these rocks can show simultaneously high 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 
208Pb/204Pb.  

In the oxidizing environments that characterize seawater alteration, U is present 

as uranyl (UO2+) cations which form compounds that are highly soluble in seawater and 

can be introduced in igneous rocks via secondary phases during low temperature 

alteration (MacDougall et al., 1979, Michard and Albaréde, 1985; Chen et al., 1986; 

Hauf et al., 2000; Wheat et al., 2002). This can lead to increases up to 500% in the U/Pb 

ratios of crystalline basaltic material (Verma, 1991) and consequentially to higher 
206Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb with time due to radiogenic ingrowth. Such an effect has 

been observed in other altered, Mesozoic submarine igneous rocks, including altered 

gabbros in the Iberian Abyssal plain (Seifert et al., 1997), basalts recovered in Hawaiian 

ODPs (Nobre Silva et al., 2009), the oceanic crust near the Canaries islands (Hoernle, 

1998), and the oceanic lithosphere of the Caribbean Igneous Province (e.g. Hauff et al., 

2000).  

Pb is more susceptible than other elements to show increases in isotopic ratios 

after hydrothermal alteration due to changes in the U and Pb concentrations introduced 

during such events. Given the relatively shorter half lives of U isotopes when compared 

to other isotopic systems (e.g. 235U ? t1/2 = 0.71 x 109 yr, 238U ? t 1/2 = 4.47 x 109 yr, 



 

284 
 

232Th ? t 1/2 = 14 x 109 yr, 147Sm ? t 1/2 = 1.06 x 1010 yr, 87Rb ? t 1/2 = 48.8 x 109 yr, 

Faure, 1986), for relatively high U/Pb, isotopic Pb ratios can become more radiogenic in 

relatively short time spans, as it has been recognized by Hauff et al. (2000) that 

associated high 207Pb/204Pb and scattered Th/U to the effects of hydrothermal alteration. 

So the higher 207Pb/204Pb and sometimes 208Pb/204Pb in some altered samples can be 

caused by a complex, open system alteration mechanism involving Pb removal, and U 

and radiogenic Pb remobilization from/by seawater. Meanwhile, Th has very low 

concentrations in seawater (? 0.00064 ppb, Langmuir and Herman, 1980) and is not 

easily removed during seawater alteration (Chen et al., 1986), so it is basically 

immobile and its concentration tends to increase in relation to Pb during alteration, due 

to Pb removal. This will result in different increases in the Pb isotopic ratios due to the 

effects of radiogenic ingrowth of rocks that have seen their U/Pb, Th/Pb and U/Th ratios 

modified by seawater alteration processes. 

However, the extremely high 207Pb/204Pb in some of the samples from the MTR 

cannot be easily reconciled with simple time integrated decay of a “source” with a high 

U/Pb ratio resulting from seawater alteration. Since 235U has such a short half life, it is 

present in very small amounts in the present day, and also was present in small amounts 

at the time of formation of these rocks. As a result high 207Pb/204Pb values usually 

indicate the presence of a very old, generally Proterozoic/Archean component with high 

time integrated U/Pb. Since the lithosphere in the region does not seem to incorporate 

ancient metasomatic veins with such age or composition (Beard et al., 2002; Chazot et 

al., 2005), this component could be inherited from contamination of the evolved MTR 

magmas by terrigenous upper crustal sediment. 

Upper crustal rocks show high U/Pb ratios due to growth in volcanic arcs, where 

high U/Pb magmas were generated during the Archaean (e.g. Mata et al., 2007) and U 

addition during granulite facies metamorphism of the lower crust which removes U and 

adds it to its upper part (e.g. Rudnick and Goldstein, 1990). These rocks can be eroded 

and the resulting sediments that inherit their radiogenic Pb isotopic signatures (average 

of 18.93, 15.71 and 39.03 for 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios, 

respectively, Millot et al., 2004) that will eventually end up being deposited as 

turbidites at high depths in the oceans, retaining the same upper crustal isotopic 

signatures (average  206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb of 19.22, 15.78, and 39.58, 

respectively, Hemming and McLennan, 2001). 



 

285 
 

Since the magmas with “lithospheric” isotopic signatures in the MTR are of 

intermediate to acidic nature (Merle et al., 2006), it is reasonable to assume that they 

experienced some low pressure fractionation in relatively shallow magma chambers. 

Those magma chambers can be located in the interface between the ocean floor and a 

layer of terrigenous turbidites on top of which the seamounts built. Such a site 

corresponds to an important density and rigidity contrast between distinct layers, which 

can facilitate the stagnation of magma and the formation of planar intrusive bodies 

where magma can accumulate and evolve (e.g Kavanagh et al., 2005). Intrusions in 

Cretaceous sediments near the Tore seamount can be observed in the seismic reflection 

profiles done in the area (C. Roque, pers. comm. 2010) and turbiditic sediments were 

identified in hole 1070A of ODP Leg 173 (Whitmarsh et al., 1998), at approximately 

the same longitude as the Tore seamount, so it is possible that such a detritic layer is 

present along the remainder of the MTR and had an important role on controlling the 

location of the magma chambers that fed those seamounts.  

If so, magmatic evolution by crystal fractionation at the MTR is likely to have 

been accompanied by some degree of assimilation of these sedimentary lithologies 

resulting from AFC processes, which might have been responsible for the observed 

increase in 207Pb/204Pb. This is supported by the detection of old radiogenic Pb in the 

zircons present in these rocks (Merle et al., 2006). The relatively unchanged Sr and Hf 

isotopic ratios can be justified by the higher contents of these elements in the magmatic 

rocks relative to the sediments, which make contamination only evident after the 

assimilation or high amounts of contaminant. Cases of assimilation of continental 

sediment in oceanic environments have been previous documented in the Canaries 

(Thirlwall et al., 1997; Hoernle et al., 1998; Hansteen and Troll, 2003) 

 The modification of U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios by hydrothermal alteration can also 

be the cause of incorrect age corrections when calculating the initial Pb isotopic ratios in 

these rocks. This leads to over or undercorrections which will not reflect the initial 

isotopic signatures of these rocks and of the source they originated from. This might be 

behind the atypical Pb isotopic signatures of the Fontanelas seamount, which will be 

discussed below. 

As it can be observed in fig. 7.45, U seems to have been mobile in the 

Fontanelas seamount as well as in the Loulé lamprophyres. The mobility of Pb is harder 

to assess since this element was only analyzed in the aliquots of the samples, some of 

which were leached. U-Th-Pb can be fractionated during leaching, resulting on an 



 

286 
 

artificial increase of certain parent daughter ratios, which will in their their turn lead to 

overestimating the amount of radioactive decay that has taken place since magma 

extraction and cooling (e.g. Hauff et al., 2000). However, given that the age corrected 

samples from Monchique from this work plot mostly within the compositional range 

defined by the age corrected samples from Bernard-Griffiths et al (1997), we can infer 

that the age correction has not been greatly overestimated for the samples collected 

onshore. 

 

 
Fig. 7.45: Plot of Th vs. U for the analyzed samples. Samples that plot out of the trends defined by 

constant Th/U have been affected by either U loss or addition. 
 

The more enriched isotopic signature of the Fontanelas seamount can nearly be 

reproduced by the radioactive decay of a basaltic rock with an age corrected isotopic 

signature similar to one of the basalts from the LVC (RM 43) but with much higher 

U/Pb, Th/Pb and Th/U, and consequentially higher 238U/204Pb and 232Th/204Pb, which 

will lead to significantly more enriched 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb by radioactive decay 

in time. These elementar ratios might have been modified during alteration and leaching 

and therefore invalidate the application of the accurate age correction in these samples. 

Nevertheless, the 207Pb/204Pb values obtained for the Fontanelas seamount in both in the 



 

287 
 

measured and corrected ratios cannot be justified exclusively by alteration or improper 

age corrections so it should reflect a primary feature of the source of these rocks. 

 

7.5.3 Nature of the sublithospheric mantle source 

 

From the discussion above we can conclude that the isotopic composition of the 

uncontaminated Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM shows characteristics 

that are compatible with a sublithospheric source. 

These rocks have higher Sr and Pb isotope ratios but less radiogenic Nd than the 

DMM (average DMM: 87Sr/86Sr 0.70263, 143Nd/144Nd 0.51313, 206Pb/204Pb 18.275, 
207Pb/204Pb 15.486, Workman and Hart, 2005), which is thought to represent most of the 

depleted asthenospheric upper mantle. They also have lower 87Sr/86Sr and higher 
143Nd/144Nd than the EM 1 and 2 components (e.g. Hart et al., 1992) and lead isotopic 

compositions are considerably less radiogenic and lower than the ones that characterize 

the HIMU component (Hart et al., 1992; Hauri et al., 1994; Stracke et al., 2005). 

The source thus seems to show an intermediate composition between DMM and 

HIMU, having lower time integrated Sm/Nd but higher Rb/Sr, U/Pb and Th/U than 

DMM while still having lower time integrated U/Pb and Th/U than HIMU as well as 

slightly higher Rb/Sr than this last component.   

Such a composition is at least partially within the range defined for several other 

mantle components, such as the C component (Hanan and Graham, 1996), FOZO (Hart 

et al., 1992; Hauri et al., 1994; Stracke et al., 2005), PREMA (Zindler and Hart, 1986; 

Wörner et al., 1986), LVC (Hoernle et al., 1995), CMR (Lustrino and Wilson, 2007), 

PHEM (Farley et al., 1992). These components have been detected in OIB and 

intraplate continental magmatic events all over the globe and are thought to represent 

mixing between EM, HIMU and DMM components within the mantle (PREMA, 

Zindler and Hart, 1986), lower mantle material present as a mixing component in all 

deep mantle plumes (PREMA, FOZO and PHEM, Zindler and Hart, 1986, Hart et al., 

1992, Farley et al., 1992), lower mantle containing recycled oceanic crust (C, Hanan 

and Graham, 1996 or FOZO, Stracke et al., 2005), enriched upwelling asthenosphere 

(LVC, Hoernle et al., 1995), or the local asthenospheric mantle that has been enriched 

by subduction or delamination processes during the Hercynian or Alpine orogenies 

(CMR, Lustrino and Wilson, 2007).  



 

288 
 

FOZO was at first defined from the observation of a FOcal ZOne (hence the 

acronym FOZO) where the compositional arrays of mantle plumes (represented by 

OIBs) and the depleted mantle (represented by MORBs) converge in Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic 

space (Hart et al., 1992; Stracke et al., 2005). This component is likely to have acquired 

its isotopic signature from the recycling oceanic crust to the lower mantle (Stracke et al., 

2005) and is the mantle component that shows a better agreement with the observed 

isotopic signatures of the source of the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM. 

Although many authors consider FOZO an idependent mantle component (e.g. 

Hart et al., 1992; Stracke et al., 2005), it is possible to produce an equivalent type of 

isotopic signature that characterizes it from the mixing and dilution of HIMU with the 

remaining DMM and EM components (e.g. Hoernle et al., 1991; Widom et al., 1999). A 

clear way of making a distinction between these two hypotheses is through the analysis 

of noble gas and Os isotope data since FOZO possess distinctively high 3He/4He ratios 

(R/RA ? 45, Ballentine et al., 2002) while HIMU shows much lower 3He/4He (R/RA ?  

5, Ballentine et al., 2002). FOZO is also thought to possess unradiogenic Os signatures 

(187Os/188Os ? 0.128), while HIMU presents very radiogenic Os ( 187Os/188Os ? 0.150) 

due to its recycled nature (e.g. Hauri, 2002; Class and Goldstein, 2005). 

Additionally, Piromallo et al. (2008) suggested that the widespread and 

relatively constant isotopic signature of Cretaceous to Quaternary magmas in the Euro-

Mediterranean area, which motivated the proposal of common sublithospheric mantle 

reservoirs (such as the previously mentioned LVC and CMR), is the result of a large 

scale mantle contamination episode by the Central Atlantic Plume (CAP) that took 

place in the Late Cretaceous, when the CAP plume was channeled through thinned 

western European lithosphere. The CAP plume should presently correspond to the 

mantle upwelling that feeds the Canaries and Cape Verde mantle plumes (Piromallo et 

al., 2008).   

Therefore, the geochemical data presented in this study, in accordance with what 

had been previously suggested for this area by Palácios (1985), Martins (1991), 

Bernard-Griffiths et al. (1997), Merle et al. (2006), Lustrino and Wilson (2007), 

Piromallo et al. (2008), and Grange et al. (2010), indicate that the source for the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the WIM seems to be primarily of sublithospheric origin  

and to be sampling a mantle composition similar to that of the FOZO component or to a 

mix between HIMU, DMM and EM components. 



 

289 
 

As the sublithospheric mantle in question does not correspond to the DMM type 

mantle that is sampled in Mid Ocean Ridges but seems to show a FOZO like signature, 

it should therefore reflect a more enriched, plume like contribution. The contribution of 

a plume like feature for this magmatism had been previously proposed for Monchique, 

by Geldmacher and Hoernle (2000) who interpreted it as the result of the first pulse of 

activity of the Madeira plume. In the case of the Madeira-Tore rise, the Cretaceous to 

present magmatic activity has been attributed to the action of a large scale thermal 

anomaly in the Canaries-Madeira-Portugal area (Hoernle et al., 1995; Merle et al., 2006, 

2009) or to complex interactions between the Canaries and Madeira hotspots, the 

Cretaceous Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and movement along the Azores-Gibraltar fault 

(Geldmacher et al., 2006).Grange et al. (2010) suggested the involvement of the same 

mantle plume proposed by Merle et al. (2006, 2009) to justify the onshore magmatism 

of the Paço d’Ilhas sill as well as the Sintra, Sines and Monchique igneous complexes. 

As was noticed in section 7.2 (figs. 7.12 and 7.15), most of the uncontaminated 

samples presented in this study, as well as many of the samples from the Madeira-Tore 

Rise fall within the compositional field defined by samples from locations thought to 

have formed due to the activity of the Canaries mantle plume. 

Though one may question the validity of the comparison of initial isotopic ratios 

of the studied Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM (94 to 72 Ma) with the 

compositional range of the Canaries and Madeira plumes which are partially defined 

based on the composition of significantly younger rocks.   

In order to address this question diagrams where the age corrected composition 

of the WIM alkaline rocks is plotted along with present day samples from the Canaries 

and Madeira plumes (7.46a, 7.47a,c), similar to the ones previously used throughout this 

study, are compared with diagrams where an age correction for 80 Ma (the average age 

of the studied WIM rocks) was applied (fig. 7.46b and 7.47b,d) both to the studied 

samples and to the rocks of the Madeira and Canaries plumes. Notice that such an age 

correction, when applied do Canaries and Madeira plumes, allows the estimation of the 

isotopic composition of the magmas produced by those hotspots at the time of 

generation of the WIM alkaline rocks. 

These figures (fig. 7.46 and 7.47) clearly show the good agreement between the 

two types of diagrams with both supporting the isotopic similitude between the WIM 

alkaline magmas and those erupted from the Canaries.

Fig. 7.46: Plots of the measured (a) and recalculated for and 80 Ma age (b) Sr and Nd isotopic 

compositions of the analyzed rocks and for samples from the Madeira and Canaries hotspots. 
 

However, the Sr-Nd isotope diagram presenting recalculated compositions for 

80 Ma of decay shows a significant number of samples that do not fit into the Canaries 

field due to somewhat more radiogenic Sr (fig. 7.46). This can be a consequence of the 

smaller amount of data points that include the necessary data to recalculate the isotopic 

compositions. Alternatively, these higher Sr and perhaps lower ?Nd can reflect small 

contributions from a lithospheric component that might correspond to the 

clinopyroxenites and websterites identified by Chazot et al. (2005) in the Iberian 

Abyssal Plain and represented in fig. 7.40. However this lithospheric contribution does 

not seem to affect the Pb isotopic system or the trace element contents. 

Most of the samples from the MTR also plot on the same field, reinforcing the 

suggestion made by Geldmacher et al. (2006) that this feature might be related to the 

evolution of the Canaries hotspot. 

It should also be noted that the samples from the Ormonde seamount and one of 

the samples from the MTR (Tore NW, Merle et al., 2006) and even the Fontanelas 

seamount seem to show compositions closer to the field defined by the samples  from 

the Madeira hotspot (figs. 7.46 and 7.47). Given that these occurrences seem to be 

younger than the others near them (except for Fontanelas, whose age is still not known), 

it is possible that the Madeira hotspot also played a role in generating them, since this 



 

291 
 

hotspot occurs further north than the Canaries hotspot and the general direction of plate 

motion during the Late Cretaceous is towards the NE (e.g. Piromallo et al., 2008).

It therefore seems likely that the source that generated the Late Cretaceous 

Alkaline magmatism on the onshore and offshore WIM was related to the presence of a 

sublithospheric thermal anomaly that appears to correspond to the Canaries mantle 



 

292 
 

plume, which shows an overall composition close to the FOZO mantle component (e.g. 

Stracke et al., 2005).  

Given that the Canaries mantle plume has been subject to numerous studies, the 

available data allow for the discrimination between FOZO and a mix of HIMU, DMM 

and the other mantle components in the source of the magmas of this mantle plume. 

HIMU has, however, consistently been the dominant plume component suggested in the 

literature (e.g. Hoernle et al., 1991; Thirlwall et al., 1997; Widom et al., 1999; Gurenko 

et al., 2006; Gurenko et al., 2009).  

Helium isotope ratios (3He/4He from 6.3 to 9.6 RA; Hilton et al., 2000; Gurenko 

et al., 2006) are low, but can be interpreted as resulting from the contribution of an 

undegassed component, more consistent with the presence of diluted FOZO (Hilton et 

al., 2000). Alternatively, it could be the result of HIMU being diluted in a DMM 

component (Hilton et al., 2000). Hilton et al. (2000) favour the hypothesis where an 

undegassed component with high 3He/4He and radiogenic Pb (FOZO?) mixes with 

DMM which is degassed and has unradiogenic Pb, although this is still a controversial 

issue (e.g. Graham, 2002; Gurenko et al., 2006). FOZO has also been suggested to be 

the dominant mantle component in the Canaries mantle plume by Ignacio et al. (2006) 

based on the isotopic signature of carbonatites from Fuerteventura. 

However, Os isotope systematics for the uncontaminated samples of the 

Canaries mantle plume (187Os/188Os 0.139 – 0.151, Widom et al., 1999) support an 

important contribution of a radiogenic, recycled component variably mixed with 

shallow, depleted asthenospheric mantle, compatible with HIMU and not with FOZO 

(Widom et al., 1999). 

Therefore, the dominant plume component in the Canaries mantle plume, and 

therefore in the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM, appears to be HIMU, which 

is thought to reflect the recycling of old Proterozoic (1.2 to 2.0 Ga) oceanic crust (e.g. 

Widom et al., 1999). 

Nevertheless, the lack of a clear age progression for the alkaline magmatism of 

the WIM implies that the magmas had their ascension and location strongly conditioned 

by local stress fields, structure, and plate motions in the region during the Late 

Cretaceous. 

The isotopic composition of the source remained relatively homogenous during 

the both pulses of alkaline magmatism, from 94 to 72 Ma. Nevertheless, differences in 

trace element composition between these two pulses point towards the presence of 



 

293 
 

residual amphibole in the source of some of the more primitive alkaline rocks from the 

second pulse of alkaline (75-72 Ma) activity in the WIM. This, along with other trace 

element characteristics of the same samples, agrees with the occurrence of 

metasomatism by a volatile rich (H2O + CO2) metasomatic agent in the source shortly 

before eruption. The metasomatic signature decreases with increasing degree of melting, 

meaning that there was not an exclusively metasomatic contribution for these magmas. 

The source for such a metasomatic agent might have been low degree melts from a 

carbonated peridotite in an ascending mantle plume or asthenospheric convection cell, 

as proposed in section 7.4.  

Amphibole is not stable at temperature and pressure conditions that characterize 

the asthenosphere (e.g. Class and Goldstein, 1997) and is usually indicative of either 

melting of the lithospheric mantle or at least of equilibration of asthenospheric melts in 

the overlying metasomatized and amphibole bearing lithospheric mantle. 

This metasomatism is particularly evident in the source of the ultramafic 

lamprophyres and must have occurred a comparatively short time before the melting 

event that generated them. This is because the isotopic compositions of the 

lamprophyres lie within the range for the other uncontaminated samples in the region 

(e.g. figs. 7.46 and 7.47), and thus show no evidence of the time-integrated 

incompatible element enrichment, resulting in more radiogenic Sr, Pb and depleted Nd 

signatures, that would be expected if the metasomatism was a much older event. 

It is likely that the hydrous and carbonated metasomatic melts derived from the 

low degrees of melting from such plume quickly crystallized or were consumed during 

open system metasomatic processes at the base of the lithosphere during the first pulse 

of activity. Only the liquids resulting from higher volumes of melting from the same 

source, represented by the tephrites of the Foz da Fonte sill, reached the surface.  

The thermal boundary layer (TBL) at the base of the lithosphere, was then 

metasomatized during the first pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. The metasomatized 

parts of this layer would have lower fusion temperatures due to their volatile rich nature 

and might have melted during the second pulse of activity, probably with the heat 

addition from other plume magmas. The melts from these metasomatic veins a 

contributed with their specific trace element signature to the resulting magmas. As the 

asthenospheric contribution increased and the metasomatized domains at the TBL were 

consumed during melting, the input metasomatic carbonatitic and the amphibole 



 

294 
 

signatures became more diluted and was progressively eliminated from the resulting 

magmas. 

This mechanism accounts for both the constant isotopic signature and the 

differences in trace element composition observed in these pulses, whereas a different 

origin for both pulses would probably have to imply differences in the isotopic 

compositions of the lithospheric and asthenospheric components (e.g. Class and 

Goldstein, 1997; Class et al., 1998; Jung et al. 2006). 

The heat source that melted the metasomatized lithosphere during the second 

pulse of alkaline activity could correspond to the Canaries plume, whose hotter center, 

was initially relatively far from the metasomatized domain, and might later have 

approached the zone of hydrated and enriched mantle lithosphere due to the motion of 

the Iberian plate above it.  

Another hypothesis to justify the two different pulses is the involvement of the 

Madeira mantle plume during the second the second pulse of alkaline activity. As was 

discussed above, the presence of a younger (? 80 Ma, Merle et al., 2006) seamount in 

the Tore area with an isotopic signature close to the lavas from the Madeira hotspot (e.g. 

fig.7.44-45) raises the possibility for the presence of this plume near the WIM during 

the final stages of magmatic activity during the Late Cretaceous. The proximity of a 

second melting anomaly could have triggered the melting of the lithosphere that had 

been previously metasomatized by the action of melts from the earlier passage of the 

Canaries plume. However, the contribution of the Madeira mantle plume would be 

expected to be reflected on the isotopic composition of the melts derived from higher 

degrees of partial melting, which is not clear for the majority of samples from the 

second pulse (e.g. figs 7.46 and 7.47). 

  Alternatively, the identical isotopic signature in melts derived from a plume 

and with a metasomatic contribution could simply reflect the small degree melting and 

re-solidification at the leading edge of the starting head of a mantle plume, as was 

suggested by Kerr et al. (2010) for the signature of the sills that these authors identified 

as being the first representatives of the melting of the Réunion plume, in Pakistan.

7.6 Summary 

The geochemical and isotopic study of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism 

of the WIM allowed for the detailed characterization of these magmas, their evolution 

processes and mantle sources. 

The ultrabasic to basic alkaline, trace element enriched melts seem to have 

originated from low degrees of partial melting (1-6%) of a trace element enriched 

source, located at depths equivalent to the garnet stability field (&gt; 60 km). That source is 

likely to correspond to a sublithospheric, volatile rich (CO2+H2O) garnet lherzolite. The 

melts from the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline activity also show some 

contribution from an amphibole bearing equivalent in the lithosphere. That same 

lithospheric lherzolite has been metasomatized by the first volatile rich (CO2+H2O) 

liquids derived from low degrees of melting from an ascending carbonated garnet 

lherzolite and therefore preserves most of its trace element and isotopic features. While 

such a metasomatic signature is only evident on the magmas from the second pulse of 

Late Cretaceous alkaline activity on the WIM, rocks from both pulses show similar 

isotopic signatures, meaning that the metasomatizing agent might have had the same 

source as the magmas from the first pulse. 

That ascending carbonated lherzolite was probably a part of the Canaries mantle 

plume since the uncontaminated magmas from the WIM show isotopic compositions 

(87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7 – 3.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 
15.609-15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00) similar to the rocks from the Canaries (see 

figs. 7.12, 7.15, 7.17 and 7.46-47), which is thought to represent the surface expression 

of a deep mantle reservoir related with the recycling of oceanic lithospheric material. 

The relatively low Mg#, Ni and Cr contents of the Late Cretaceous alkaline 

magmas resulting from the partial melting of such sources went through early fractional 

crystallization events before ascending to the surface or upper crustal levels. 

Trace element compositions indicate that at shallower depths, the ultrabasic to 

basic magmas evolved towards more silicic compositions by fractional crystallization of 

firstly olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides, with amphibole and plagioclase gaining 

more importance in the more differentiated terms. 

Most of the samples from the basic rocks in the igneous complexes of Sines and 

Sintra have their major and trace element compositions controlled by crystal 

accumulation processes. The recognition of the existence of such processes allowed the 



 

296 
 

identification of different levels of exposure on what probably corresponded to the same 

magmatic chamber in the different igneous complexes. In this case, the Pedras Negras 

gabbro in Sines and the Azoia gabbro in Sintra would correspond to deeper levels of the 

chambers, where more basic phases such as olivine and clinopyroxene precipitated, 

while the Praia Vasco da Gama and Peninha gabbros represent higher parts of the same 

intrusions, repectively, where more evolved liquid accumulated and precipitated mostly 

amphibole and plagioclase. A similar process had already been identified in the Paço 

d’Ilhas sill (Mahmoudi, 1991). 

However, fractional crystallization had to be coupled with assimilation of crustal 

lithologies in order to explain the evolution of the isotopic and trace element signatures 

seen in these rocks. Two different AFC trends are observed, one that is observed mainly 

in basic sills and implies the assimilation of an Sr-rich yet, Nd and Pb poor, contaminant 

which is only reflected in changes towards more radiogenic Sr isotopic signatures 

(87Sr/86Sri up to 0.7049 while ?Ndi remains unchanged), and is likely to correspond to a 

carbonated lithology. The other AFC trend encompasses the majority of the more silica 

rich rocks and the contaminant involved should correspond to a lithology that is 

enriched in SiO2, Th, K, 87Sr/86Sr (up to 0.70389) and 207Pb/204Pb (up to 15.6336 
207Pb/204Pbi), but depleted in La, Nb, 143Nd/144Nd (?Ndi down to 2.8), 206Pb/204Pb and 
208Pb/204Pb (down to 18.8268 and 38.6027). These characteristics are typical of upper 

crustal rocks, but the exact nature of that upper crustal lithology remains unclear, 

although a siliciclastic sedimentary rock seems the more likely candidate. 

Lead isotopic ratios in the gabbros from Sintra and Sines show values that are 

typical of contaminated rocks but these samples do not, however, share any of the other 

isotopic or trace element characteristics with the other contaminated rocks. This 

suggests that the unradiogenic 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb and radiogenic 207Pb/204Pb 

might have been acquired by these gabbros as the result of an hydrothermal 

metasomatic event that was also responsible for the crystallization of epidote, green 

amphibole, feldspar and carbonate in these rocks. The metasomatic fluid might have 

been relatively Pb rich in relation to the gabbros but comparatively Sr and Nd poor, 

which would justify the changes in the Pb isotopic signature but not in the Sr and Nd 

isotopic ratios. Given the similarity of the changes in Pb isotopic compositions between 

the gabbros and the upper crustal contaminant detected in the more evolved rocks, it is 

suggested that the fluid derived from the upper crustal country rocks that surround the 



 

297 
 

igneous complexes either by dehydration processes or simply from mobilization of 

interstitial pore solutions. 

Magma mixing was inferred to have taken place at depth from petrographic and 

mineral chemistry data (see sections 6.1 and 6.2), yet it seems to have played a minor 

role in the evolution of the studied rocks. In fact, the modeling of mixing between the 

basic and intermediate end members postulated in section 6.2 failing to reproduce the 

observed major and trace element signatures.

8. Discussion and geodynamical implications 
 

This section aims at establishing a connection between the geochronological, 

geochemical and mineral chemistry data presented and discussed in the previous 

sections of this manuscript and integrate them with information relative to the plate 

motion, the structure and tectonics of the region, in order to establish a coherent 

geodynamical model that explains the occurrence of the studied alkaline magmatic 

episode in the WIM during the Late Cretaceous.  

8.1 The relationship between the alkaline magmatism in the WIM, hot 

mantle anomalies and plate kinematics 

The alkaline magmatism that took place in the WIM during the Late Cretaceous 

is an important event in the history of the then recently formed passive margin. The 

volume of erupted material of the Madeira-Tore Rise (MTR) alone is calculated to be 

over 105 km3 (Merle et al., 2009). The magmatism that took place between the Tore 

seamount and mainland Portugal and in the onshore WIM has to be added to the volume 

erupted in the MTR, as is also the case with the alkaline magmatism present in the other 

side of the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR), materialized by the Newfoundland seamounts. 

Together, these occurrences total an important volume of magmatism that spreads 

through three different plates (North America, Iberia/Europe and Africa) which cannot 

be easily reconciled with shallow magma generation mechanisms such as 

decompression melting along deep transfer faults or even with shallow edge driven 

convection, as proposed by Matton and Jébrák (2009), due to its scattered nature and the 

absence of cratonic lithosphere in the region. 

Since the area affected by this magmatism was not undergoing contemporaneous 

extension, the existence of such a large volume of magma must then be related to the 

presence of one or several deeper, hotter and/or wetter mantle anomaly(ies) in the 

region during the Late Cretaceous.  

Such melting anomalies are likely to originate in deeper, warmer parts of the 

mantle and correspond to mantle plumes as defined by Morgan (1971). Also, the 

isotopic signatures of the uncontaminated rocks in the region favor the hypothesis that 

they might have derived from relatively similar sources (e.g. Geldmacher et al., 2006; 

Merle et al., 2006; Grange et al., 2010; this study).

represent locations of some reference areas, rather than individual centers: Eifel–Bohemia (EB) and 
Vosges-Massif Central (VO), exhibiting long-lived and continuous activity; Portugal–Canaries (PC), 
Hungary–Serbia (HS), Veneto Volcanic Province (VE), Pietre Nere (PN) and Morocco (MO), 
circumscribing the region of older activity (N55–60 Ma). Portugal is plotted in red to acknowledge its 
relation to the Canaries–Madeira hotspot track (i.e. Geldmacher et al., 2005). The expected paleo-
positions at 94 Ma of the remaining areas are therefore reported with a question mark. A dashed line 
bounds the region enclosing paleo-positions of centers which erupted oldest alkali products. Background 
map is given at 1100 km depth for two different global tomographic models: a) tx2005 (Simmons et al., 
2006), b) Karason and van der Hilst (2001). Shear-wave (a) and P-wave (b) velocity anomalies exhibit 
consistent large-scale features at this depth in the lower mantle: low velocity anomalies encompassing 
north-western Africa and central-eastern Atlantic, in contrast to high velocity anomalies in Eastern 
Europe and Mediterranean and north-eastern Africa. As in Piromallo et al. (2008).

The passage of the Iberian/European plate over the regions of the mantle where 

the Madeira and Canaries plumes are located during the late Cretaceous has already 

been suggested to explain the presence of the abundant alkaline magmatism in the 

region. Morgan (1983) and Duncan (1984) suggested that Iberia had been positioned 

very near both the Madeira and Canaries plumes during the Late Cretaceous. The 

paleogeographical reconstitution made by Piromallo et al. (2008) also shows the Iberian 

region on top of the Canaries mantle plume at 94 Ma (fig. 8.1) 

The Newfoundland seamounts (Duncan, 1984; Geldmacher et al., 2006), the 

alkaline rocks of the Ormonde peak in the Gorringe bank (Geldmacher et al., 2006), and 

the Monchique igneous complex (Geldmacher et al., 2000) have been attributed to the 

melting of Madeira plume material, while the Canaries plume has been associated with 

the magmatism of (at least) the southern half of the MTR (Geldmacher et al., 2006). 

Other authors did not attribute this mantle anomaly to a specific plume, 

preferring to refer to a larger feature, such as a regional widespread mantle upwelling 

the Central Atlantic, resulting on a wide, long lived thermal anomaly from which 

smaller magmatic pulses develop (Merle et al., 2006, 2009; Grange et al., 2010). 

According to the authors, this feature has been generating magmatism in the Portugal-

Madeira-Canaries-Azores area since the Cretaceous. Such an anomaly can correspond 

to the low velocity zones in the mantle identified in the mantle between the Canaries 

and Iberia by seismic tomography studies (e.g. Hoernle et al., 1995; Montelli, et al., 

2004).  

Paleomagnetic data collected on some of the onshore intrusions and compiled in 

table 8.1 also points towards magma cooling at paleolatitudes similar to the ones where 

the Madeira and Canaries plume heads (which can be up to 2000 km in diameter, e.g. 

Griffiths and Campbell, 1990; Campbell, 2007), are presently located (Madeira ? 

32.6N; Canaries ? 27.5N), adding further strength to the relationship between these 

hotspots and the observed Late Cretaceous magmatism. Incidentally, these data are also 

compatible, within error, with magma generation taking place on smaller, hot mantle 

anomalies. 

Additionally, the existence of uplift and erosion that is not associated with 

important tectonic shortening in the Lusitanian basin between the Nazaré and Arrábida 

faults (Proença da Cunha and Pena dos Reis, 1995; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Dinis et al., 

2008),  as well as thermal metamorphism and hydrothermal activity in the centre of 

Iberia (Casquet et al., 1992; Tritlla and Solé, 1999) pre-dating and during the onset of 



 

301 
 

the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle support the hypothesis of the involvement of 

anomalously hot mantle in this event. Moreover, in the Sines region, the Late 

Cretaceous period of slope progradation is associated with regional tilting and thermal 

uplift in the central proximal part of the margin (38ºN), most likely in association with 

the contemporaneous alkaline magmatism (Alves et al., 2009).

The distribution of alkaline magmatism within two different plates between 100 

and 65 Ma is also suggestive of the presence of a mantle melting anomaly in the region. 

This anomaly was initially located in the American plate, generating the Newfoundland 

seamounts but from 95 Ma onwards seems to be located to the east of the MAR, under 

the WIM, where it is responsible for the formation of the MTR and the onshore WIM 

magmatism (fig. 8.2). The magmatism seems to progress further SW with time, which is 

in accordance with general plate motion towards the NE (e.g. Piromallo et al., 2008, fig. 

8.1).

the figure. J – J magnetic anomaly, FC- Flemish Cap, GaB- Galicia Banks. Late Cretaceous alkaline

However, the lack of a clear age progression for the onshore and offshore 

magmatism and the similar ages obtained for the lower volume of alkaline magmatism 

intruding the opposite rifted and thinned margins of the Iberian plate (105-69 Ma in the 

Pyrenees, Basque-Cantabrian basin,  Catalan ranges, and  Galicia; Ancochea et al., 

1992; Carracedo et al., 1999; Fabriès et al., 1998; Montigny et al., 1986, Solé et al., 

2003) suggest a relationship between the Late Cretaceous magmatism and the changes 

in plate kinematics and seafloor spreading geometry contemporaneous with the opening 

of the Bay of Biscay, as well as a strong structural control on the position of the onshore 

magmatic occurrences, instead of a simpler model where magma generation takes place 

on a hot mantle plume located under the moving lithosphere.  

Nevertheless, a model involving magma generation exclusively by 

decompression associated with plate kinematics and/or movement across lithospheric 

structures alone is not realistic, since these processes cannot generate the large volumes 

of magmas observed in the WIM. Also, the isotopic characteristics of these magmas 

point towards the contribution of a hot, deep sublithospheric mantle anomaly (see 

section 7.5.3). So it is therefore more likely that this magmatism is related to the 

presence of the Canaries hotspot in the mantle underneath region during the Late 

Cretaceous but that plate kinematics, the structure and tectonics of the WIM play a key 

role in controlling the timing, location and volume of some of these magmatic 

occurrences, as discussed on section 8.2. 

 

8.2 The relationship between the structure of the WIM and the 

location of the alkaline magmatism 

During the Late Cretaceous, magmatism was more abundant offshore than 

onshore, meaning that the less voluminous onshore magmatism must have had its 

location strongly controlled by local structure, horizontal plate kinematics and tectonic 

processes, whether it originated from a wide thermal anomaly such as a mantle plume or 

a more regional feature. The thicker continental lithosphere is also likely to have limited 



 

304 
 

adiabatic melting above an ascending mantle plume or convective cell, resulting in more 

reduced rates of magmatic productivity under continental Iberia, in relation to oceanic 

or ocean-continent transitional domains.

One structure that played a major role in controlling the location of the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline magmatism seems to be the Sintra-Tore fault (Badagola, 2008; fig. 

8.3). This structure connects the 88-80 Ma (Merle et al., 2006) Tore seamounts with the 

80-75 Ma Sintra igneous complex (Storetvedt et al., 1987; Miranda et al., 2009) and 

corresponds to the superficial expression of a deep strike slip fault whose orientation 

varies between NW-SE, close to Sintra (fig. 8.3) but becomes WNW-ESE as it passes 

near the Fontanelas seamount and approaches the Tore seamount (fig. 8.4). Several 

magmatic features have been identified along its strike, including the Fontanelas 

seamount (fig. 8.4), as well as several small scale magmatic features identified by 

Badagola (2008) in the continental shelf between Sintra and Fontanelas (fig. 8.3).

2009), the CANHOES (PDCTM/MAR/56781/2004) project. Most of the bathymetry for the Estremadura 

spur and the area around the Fontanelas Seamount is a courtesy ofthe EMEPC.  

 

Several magnetic anomalies that also possibly correspond to igneous intrusions 

were identified further W of the Fontanelas seamount (e.g. Silva et al., 2000; fig. 2.2). 

They do not occur in close proximity of the Sintra- Tore fault, but can be related with 

other minor faults in the region with similar orientations (NW-SE to E-W, fig. 8.4) 

Other important WNW-ESE to E-W trending structures were also identified 

between the Estremadura spur and the Tore seamount (Roque, 2009), with the present 

day morphology of the seamount being controlled by some of these features. These 

structures are mostly thrusts and backthrusts that deform sediments up to the Pliocene-

Pleistocene (Roque, 2009) but have been active since at least the Cretaceous and are 

likely to have an even older origin, for instance, as rift related transfer faults (C. Roque, 

pers. comm., 2010). 

The position of these important E-W structures also coincides with the proposed 

location for the offshore boundary between the Paleozoic terranes of the South 

Portuguese Zone and Ossa Morena Zone, which would correspond to the boundary 

between the Meguma and Avalon terranes in the conjugate Grand Banks margin (fig. 

8.5, Capdevila and Mougenot, 1988; Lefort et al., 1996), which is materialized by 

another set of linear magnetic anomalies known as the Collector Anomaly (CA). Other 

geodynamic reconstitutions of the Variscan orogeny in Iberia do not necessarily agree 

with the model presented in fig. 8.5 (e.g. Ribeiro et al. 2007) but do not invalidate the 

hypothesis that is proposed in this section.  

The Collector Anomaly (CA) is thought to represent the suture of the Theic 

ocean (e.g Lefort et al., 1996), but given its proximity with the Newfoundland 

seamounts and the recently recognized alkaline intrusions along the Sintra-Tore fault, it 

is possible that the positive magnetic anomalies in the Grand Banks margin can also 

correspond to Cretaceous alkaline intrusions. Such an inference is speculative since 

there does not seem to be a consensus over the general position of the CA (e.g. Jansa et 

al., 1993; Pe-Piper et al. 1994) and whether the CA was positioned further south during 



 

307 
 

the Cretaceous (e.g. Silva et al., 2000). Thus the location of the CA needs to be 

confirmed by detailed plate kinematics reconstructions and geomagnetism studies.

Other features, such as the offset of the magnetic J anomaly in the Estremadura 

Spur region (e.g. figs. 1 and 2 in Sibuet et al., 2007; fig. 6 in Srivastava et al., 2000; fig. 

1 in Withmarsh and Wallace, 2001) and the lack of peridotite ridges in the Tagus 

Abyssal plain in contrast with the Iberian Abyssal plain seem to indicate that the Sintra-

Tore fault, as part of the Estremadura Spur, appears to be part of a very important 

structural boundary in the region that may have been crucial in facilitating the ascent 

and emplacement of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas in the WIM. 



 

308 
 

The recognition of the Sintra-Tore fault as an important structure of the WIM 

raises the question of whether other structures of the same type, or at least with the same 

orientation, are associated with the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism. For instance, 

the geometry of the feeders of the Sintra intrusion, deduced from AMS and gravimetric 

data, also point towards the existence of E-W conduits, along with others with NE-SW 

and NW-SE directions (Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010).

fault zone. From Kullberg et al., 2006. 
 

Also, the Sintra igneous complex, in addition to being located on the Sintra-Tore 

fault, is affected by a late thrust with an approximately E-W direction and is located at 

the intersection of these structures with other faults trending NW-SE to N-S (figs. 8.5 

and 8.6). It is possible that this thrust acted earlier as a transfer or normal fault and later 

as a conduit for magma ascent before basin inversion took place and reactivated with 

the presently observed kinematic (Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). This structure is thought 



 

309 
 

to continue towards the East, between Sintra and the Tagus river, in the form of a blind 

thrust whose surface expression is the fold with an E-W axis that occurs in the Loures 

region, where many of the LVC’s flows and necks outcrop (fig. 8.6). 

In the Lisbon region, the Monsanto anticline, the Torres Vedras and Tagus 

estuary fault are other important structures showing the same general E-W trend and are 

located near the region where most of the rocks from the LVC outcrop.  

The alkaline Foz da Fonte and Sesimbra sills are located not too far away from 

the Arrábida fault, which corresponds to the southern limit of the Lusitanian basin and 

is interpreted as being an important, E-W oriented structure thought to have acted as a 

normal/transfer fault during rifting (e.g. Kullberg, 2000; Kullberg et al., 2010). 

However, magnetic lineation and imbrications in the Foz da Fonte sill indicate a WSW-

ENE flow direction which can be indicative of the presence of a linear feeder with a 

NNE-SSW direction,instead of E-W (Miranda et al., 2006). 

The Torres Vedras, Arrábida and Tagus estuary faults are all important 

structures in the region, limiting different half grabens or sub-basins inside the larger 

Lusitanian basin (Ribeiro et al., 1979; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Kullberg, 2000; Alves et 

al., 2003). They are consequentially thought to correspond to syn-rift transfer faults 

showing an oblique movement that were reactivated as thrust and reverse faults during 

the Alpine orogeny. These can therefore be considered important crustal discontinuities 

that might have played a large role of facilitating the ascent of the alkaline magmas 

during the Late Cretaceous. 

The Sines igneous complex is located on the Southern border of the small 

Santiago do Cacém Mesozoic basin, which should contact with the surrounding 

Paleozoic basement through an approximately E-W fault. Furthermore, the complex is 

cut by structures with the roughly the same direction (e.g. Inverno et al., 1993; fig. 

2.11). NNW-SSE faults, such as the Santo André fault, are also important in the region 

as they define the limits of the previously mentioned basin (e.g. Inverno et al., 1993) 

In the southern Monchique igneous complex, Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares 

(2003) proposed that magma ascension and installation was controlled by pre existing 

left strike slip ENE-WSW faults, while other authors (Gomes and Pereira, 2004; 

Sant’Ovaia et al., 2007) argue for the existence of NW-SE feeders on the basis of AMS 

and paleomagnetic data. Important structures in the region include the nearby NNW-

SSE Portimão fault and structures with NNE-SSW directions that offset the complex 

(Gonzalez-Clavijo and Valadares, 2003). 



 

310 
 

The scattered intrusions in the Algarve basin appear associated with salt diapirs 

(Loulé dykes), normal faults (Praia do Zavial), N-S to NNW-SSE oriented faults (Lagos 

region) and can even intrude E-W structures in the Western Algarve (Romariz et al., 

1979; Terrinha, 1998). 

The variety of different structures involved in controlling the ascent and 

emplacement of these magmas and acting as feeders in the larger intrusions at upper 

crustal levels implies that these alkaline magmas used pre-existing, possibly rift related 

structures to make their way up to the surface. Many of these pre-existing structures 

should have been inherited from existing fractures in the Variscan basement (Terrinha, 

1998; Kullberg, 2000) and could therefore extend to deep crustal levels. Nevertheless, 

the persistent identification of E-W transfer faults associated with the Late Cretaceous 

magmatic products in the Lusitanian basin suggests a higher importance of these 

structures in controlling the ascension of the magmas. Meanwhile, the actual location of 

the major magmatic occurrences seems to be controlled by the intersection of such 

faults with other NNW-SSE or NE-SW fractures.  

It has been suggested that the Sintra, Sines and Monchique complexes are 

connected at deeper levels (lower crust and subcontinental mantle lithosphere), by a 

NNW-SSE trending dextral strike slip fault related to the rotation of Iberia (Ribeiro et 

al., 1979; Terrinha, 1998). Alternatively, it has been put forward that the Sintra-Tore 

and Sintra-Sines-Monchique (SSM) faults share a common origin, related to the super-

critical propagation of a lithospheric fracture resulting from a meteorite impact in the 

Tore Seamount area (Ribeiro et al., 1997, Ribeiro, 2002). These authors propose that the 

change in direction from approximately E-W to NNW-SSE is the result of the refraction 

of fault propagation due to changes in the thickness and rheology of the lithosphere 

being crossed, that progressively changes from very thinned (Tore), to thinned (Sintra) 

to probably unthinned (Monchique). 

The existence of the Sintra-Sines-Monchique (SSM) fault is yet to be confirmed 

by either direct observation of indirect geophysical methods. When compared to the 

Sintra-Tore fault, which is observed at the surface and in seismic profiles (Badagola, 

2008), the evidence for the existence of the SSM fault is not obvious. Nonetheless, a 

series of smaller scale fractures with the same NNW-SSE strike of the SSM fault have 

been identified in the Lusitanian and Algarve basins (Terrinha, 1998; Kullberg et al., 

2006, 2010; fig. 8.6), and close to the Sintra and Monchique igneous complexes.  



 

311 
 

A NW-SE trending fault zone with approximately 50 km of length has been 

identified between the Sintra complex and the Miocene Arrábida thrust belt (Kullberg, 

2000; Kullberg et al., 2006, 2010). These faults cut across the Lower Cretaceous 

sediments, and also the Foz da Fonte sill. Kullberg (2000) has shown that these 

structures were active during Mid Jurassic rifting in the Arrábida belt. Also, they are 

often injected with basic to intermediate dykes (the Oeiras-Cascais dykes). 

The Portimão fault was mapped from the vicinities of the Monchique complex, 

till approximately 100 km further south, already in the offshore domain (Terrinha et al., 

1999; Terrinha et al., 2009). This structure is a steep strike slip fault at present, but it 

was active at least since Mid Jurassic times, separating two sub-basins in the main 

Algarve basin (Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 1999). 

These two fault zones were interpreted as the surface expression of the deeper 

SSM strike-slip fault that concentrated shear during the rotation of Iberia and controlled 

the ascent of the alkaline magmas (e.g. Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg 

et al., 2006, 2010).  

In summary, the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas seem to have used of a 

series of pre-existing structures in order to extrude or ascend to upper crustal levels, 

noticeably E-W to WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE and NE-SW trending faults. In the 

uppermost crustal levels, the intersection of these fault systems controlled the location 

of individual occurrences, as can be deduced from the geometry of the feeders in Sintra 

(Terrinha et al., 2003; Kullberg et al., 2006; 2010) and from the main structures present 

in the vicinities of both this and the Sines igneous complex. In its turn magma ascent in 

the Monchique igneous complex is thought to have taken place in reactivated Variscan 

WNW-ESE to NW-SE structures in the upper crust. 

In the Lusitanian basin, the Estremadura spur and possibly even in the case of 

the Sines igneous complex, the E-W to WNW-ESE structures seem to have played a 

major role in controlling the ascent of these magmas. Since many of these are thought to 

have acted as transfer faults during rifting and also correspond to reactivated structures 

inherited from the Variscan orogen, they can be thought of as extending to relatively 

high depths in the lithosphere, at least until the lower crust and to control the magma 

ascent, as previously suggested by Terrinha (1998). 

At the lower crust and subcontinental mantle lithosphere levels, the debate 

remains relatively open, in the sense that both the WNW-ESE to E-W faults in the Tore-

Estremadura region and the hypothetical NNW-SSE SSM fault are viable pathways for 



 

312 
 

rising magmas, although their extension to such depths cannot be unequivocally 

demonstrated at present.  

 

8.3 Towards an integrated geodynamical model for the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of the WIM 

The geochronological evidence for the existence of two pulses of alkaline 

magmatism was presented in section 5 of this work (see also Miranda et al., 2009). It 

was also shown that these two pulses are distinguishable in terms of trace element 

abundances (section 7.1), but derived from mantle source with a nearly identical 

sublithospheric mantle isotopic signature (sections 7.2 and 7.5). 

Meanwhile, Grange et al. (2010) argued for the existence of an age progression 

in their dataset, with the intrusions younging towards the south. They interpret this age 

progression to reflect the movement of the Iberian plate above a fixed mantle plume. 

However, this implies that the plate has to move in from SSE to NNW between 88 and 

68 Ma (Grange et al., 2010), while in fact the western part of the Iberian plate moves 

from NW to SE up to 80 Ma as a consequence of the opening of the Bay of Biscay 

(Sibuet et al., 2004), and shows an overall northwards (? SW to NE) motion from then 

onwards, as the opening of the Bay of Biscay ends and Iberia starts moving in the same 

direction as Europe (e.g Piromallo et al., 2008). Even if the overall SW to NE motion 

was predominant during the Late Cretaceous, the igneous complexes should be aligned 

in a NE-SW direction, while their actual alignment is NNW-SSE. Also, the 

interpretation by Grange et al. (2010) does not account for a younger event in the 

Lisbon area at 72 Ma, which could not reflect the northwards drift of Iberia above a 

mantle plume.  

Moreover, the occurrence of magmatic of activity in the same location at 

different time intervals (in the Lisbon region there is alkaline magmatism at 94-88 Ma 

and later 75-72 Ma, with the Sintra granite intruding in between at 79 Ma), the 

simultaneous activity in different locations at approximately the same time (Algarve, 

Sines and Lisboa between 75-72), the Late Cretaceous kinematics of the Iberian plate 

and the absence of an age progression in the offshore WIM magmatism favor the 

hypothesis of the occurrence of two distinct pulses of activity on the onshore WIM 

instead of a simple N to S age progression.  



 

313 
 

As discussed in section 7, the enriched nature of the Late Cretaceous alkaline 

magmas point towards and OIB like source. This type of sources is usually located in 

the sublithospheric mantle and is associated with deep rooted upwelling from lower 

parts of this layer, in the form of mantle plumes (e.g. Morgan, 1971). 

The isotopic characteristics of the uncontaminated sampled rocks (87Sr/86Sri  

0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7 – 3.7; 206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-15.580, 
208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00) are compatible with a common origin between these magmas 

and the melts from the Canaries mantle plume. Considering that the known 

paleomagnetic data and paleogeographic reconstitutions indicate that Iberia was located 

in the vicinities of the Canaries mantle plume during the Late Cretaceous (see section 

8.1), it can be argued that this hot mantle anomaly is a long living one and that it was 

the heat and mass source of the alkaline magmatism of the WIM. 

During the first pulse of alkaline activity in the onshore WIM (94-88 Ma), the 

sublithospheric, plume related magmas represented by the Foz da Fonte sill were 

installed in the upper crust without traces of interaction with the mantle lithosphere or 

with the crust. In its turn, the Paço d’Ilhas sill is constituted by magmas that suffered e 

important assimilation of crustal material and fractional crystallization. 

Samples from the second pulse (75-72 Ma) show distinct trace element patterns 

in relation to the first one. The differences observed between the two pulses can be 

related to different levels of interaction of sublithospheric plume magmas with the 

overlying continental mantle lithosphere as a consequence of changes observed in the 

Iberian plate motion. It is suggested that the lack of a metasomatic signature during the 

first pulse is linked to a more favorable stress field during the rotation of Iberia (up to 

80 Ma, Sibuet et al., 2004), which allowed for the quick ascent of the magmas generated 

in an ascending plume.  

The second pulse coincided with the onset of the rapid collision between the 

African and Iberian plates and the first recorded phases of inversion of the Mesozoic 

basins (e.g. Mougenot, 1980, Terrinha, 1998, Rosembaum et al., 2002) which started 

after the rotation had ceased. This created a less favorable stress regime and restrained 

the opening of fractures and quick magmatic ascent, favoring interaction with 

subcontinental lithosphere which either resulted in the metasomatism of its lowermost 

part, or allowed for the melting and incorporation of lithosphere that had been probably 

metasomatized during the first pulse. 



 

314 
 

The metasomatizing agents were probably the first volatile rich (H2O+CO2) low 

degree melts from the ascending Canaries plume. These early melts metasomatized the 

overlying subcontinental mantle, imprinting the plume signature and lowering the 

fusion temperatures of these rocks. It is the similarity in the isotopic signatures observed 

in both pulses that allows the assignment of common origins to the sublithospheric and 

metasomatic components.

Cretaceous in the WIM. Adapted from Kullberg et al., 2010. 

 

Later, when these rocks crossed their solidus either due to the higher proximity 

of the plume’s hot center or to the passage of other plume derived melts, the 

metasomatized lithosphere started to melt, contributing to the volume of magma 

generated during the second pulse. The metasomatic signature is reflected only in the 

magmas derived from smaller amounts of partial melting, since it becomes 

progressively more diluted with time, as the liquids generated in the asthenosphere from 

the melting of the plume head increase in volume. This metasomatic signature is 

characterized by negative K, Zr, Hf and sometimes Ti anomalies in the multielemental 

diagrams, accompanied by low Ti/Eu, and high Zr/Hf. 

As the magmas from the first pulse (or early magmas from the second pulse) 

ascended, some became trapped at depths corresponding to the upper mantle or lower 

crust, where they started to crystallize, among other minerals, clinopyroxene and 

amphibole, thus evolving from basic to at least intermediate compositions (see section 

6.2). 



 

315 
 

During the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline activity, some of the 

chambers or conduits where these magmas evolved were recharged with a more 

primitive batch of basanitic magma which mixed with the more evolved liquid they 

contained, creating the reversely zoned crystals observed in some of the Late 

Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM (see section 6.2). During these recharge events 

the mixing of a hot, basic magma with a more evolved, volatile rich melt led to the 

pressurization and reduction in density of the basic magmas aiding the quick ascent of 

these magmas. The higher volatile content of the resulting magmas could have also 

facilitated the ascent to shallower levels, possibly leading to the extrusion of the LVC, 

which is characterized by the occurrence of explosive events before the onset of the 

effusive activity. The explosive events of the LVC can be tentatively related to 

decompression and devolatilization of a volatile rich magma. 

Although mineral chemistry data seems to show that magma mixing is a 

relatively common phenomenon in the Late Cretaceous alkaline rocks of the WIM, it 

did not have a major influence in the isotopic or major and trace element characteristics 

of the rocks where it is recorded. This leads to the proposition that the mixed magmas 

were probably related to a common source and that only a small volume of intermediate 

melt mixed with the primitive basic liquid (see sections 6.2 and 7.3.3). 

During their ascent, these magmas used pre-existing faults inherited from 

Mesozoic rifting and the Paleozoic Variscan orogeny. Many of the magmatic 

occurrences in the western Mesozoic basins seem to be related to WNW-ESE to E-W 

transfer faults that were active during rifting (fig. 8.7). Meanwhile, their exact site of 

emplacement seems to result from the intersection of these structures with other fault 

systems with NE-SW and NNW-SSE orientations.  

Some of the previously mentioned E-W to WNW-ESE structures might 

represent major lithospheric discontinuities and acted as preferential pathways for 

magma ascent and emplacement, as seems to be the case with the Sintra-Tore faults, 

along which several intrusions are found, including the Sintra igneous complex and the 

Fontanelas seamount, among several other minor intrusives. 

Many of these magmas did not reach the surface but instead accumulated as sills 

and laccoliths in upper crustal levels and evolved through combined assimilation and 

fractional crystallization processes. Crystal fractionation led to the formation of 

cumulate rocks in the larger intrusive bodies, either by gravitational settling (e.g. Pedras 



 

316 
 

Negras gabbro in the Sines complex) or by flotation processes (e.g. 

benmoreite/monzonite layers of the Paço d’Ilhas sill).

and c) at ? 75 Ma during the second pulse of alkaline magmatic activity. Adapted from Alves et al., 2009. 

 

The energy provided by conductive cooling of the intrusions and by 

crystallization allowed for the assimilation of the country rock. The contaminants are 

thought to be of upper crustal nature and the two different contamination trends 

observed in the data set relate to the different nature of the assimilated material. The 

higher 87Sr/86Sr, 207Pb/204Pb  and lower 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb trend is 

thought to reflect contamination from siliclastic sedimentary material, while the trend 

that is characterized only by a rise in 87Sr/86Sr might be related to the assimilation of 

small amounts of Sr rich and Nd poor carbonated material. The high 207Pb/204Pb of the 



 

317 
 

siliciclastic contaminant suggests that this contaminant has inherited an old, 

Precambrian crustal component. 

The scatter observed in the ages for both the onshore and offshore Late 

Cretaceous alkaline occurrences is also indicative of the importance of the plate 

kinematics of Iberia, pre-existing structure and the size of the hot mantle anomaly in 

controlling the timing and location of this magmatism (fig. 8.8). Most of the seamounts 

in the Madeira-Tore rise were active (103 Ma to 80 Ma, Merle et al., 2006, 2009; 

Geldmacher et al., 2006) during the time interval when the opening of the bay of Biscay 

and the rotation of Iberia took place (? 118 -80 Ma, Sibuet et al., 2004). These 

seamounts extruded on a major lithospheric discontinuity that defines the passage from 

a transitional continental domain constituted mostly by exhumed peridotite, to true 

oceanic crust, as schematically shown on fig. 8.7 and 8.8 (e.g. Sibuet et al., 2007; 

Afilhado et al., 2010). During the rotation of Iberia, this discontinuity might have 

worked as a lithospheric strike slip fault and facilitated the ascent of the magmas along 

its strike, especially in areas where it intersected other structures or where small changes 

in its general trend might have led to the onset of transtension. The simultaneous 

magmatism in the Paço d’Ilhas and Foz da Fonte intrusions and possibly also in the 

Sintra complex (the granite intrudes at ca. 79 Ma) can be related to the channeling of 

plume material from the Tore area, where significant magmatism took place, through 

corridors of thinned lithosphere or along the E-W to WNW-ESE structures of the 

Estremadura spur. The Newfoundland seamounts, which erupted on the American plate 

but in an area where similar E-W to WNW-ESE structures might be present, show a 

similar age of 98 Ma (Sullivan and Keen, 1977 in Pe-Piper et al., 2007). 

From 80 Ma to the end of the Cretaceous, the offshore magmatism in the WIM 

seems to be limited to the Ormonde peak of the Gorringe bank (? 65 Ma, Féraud et al., 

1982, 1986) although the NW Tore seamount shows a 80.5 Ma age (Merle et al., 2006). 

On the other hand, this was the time when magmatism was most abundant in the 

onshore WIM, which might reflect the drift of Iberia over a hotter area of the mantle 

(fig. 8.8). The small amount of magma production in the onshore with respect to the 

offshore is likely to be related both to the higher thickness of the lithosphere in this 

region, which held back magma production by decompression, and to the contemporary 

tectonic regime characterized by compression due to the initiation of collision between 

Africa and Iberia/Europe. 



 

318 
 

As was mentioned earlier, the most likely source for the Late Cretaceous 

alkaline magmatism of the WIM seems to have been the Canaries mantles plume (see 

section 7.4), however, it remains unclear if it continued to affect the region throughout 

the duration of both pulses or if at some point the metasomatized lithosphere bearing the 

Canaries plume isotopic and trace element signature melted to generate the magmas of 

the second pulse. If it was the latter case, an additional heat source was necessary to 

melt the refertilized lithosphere. That heat source might have speculatively been the 

Madeira mantle plume.

9. Conclusions 
 

After a careful analysis of the new geochronological, geochemical and mineral 

chemistry data and of the elaboration of a model for the geodynamic evolution of Iberia 

on the previous sections, this part of the manuscript will act as an extended summary of 

the present work and list the main conclusions from each of these sections. 

 

Sampling: 

 
• The sampling, analysis and study of the basaltic (s.l.) pillow lavas of the 

Fontanelas seamount suggest that the positive magnetic anomalies (one of which 

corresponds to the Fontanelas seamount) between the Tore seamount and the Sintra 

igneous complex could correspond to Late Cretaceus alkaline igneous occurrences. 

 
Geochronology: 

 
• The new age determinations, combined with previously published data, 

allowed to constrain the duration of the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle to circa 22 

Ma, between 94 and 72 Ma, and to define two distinct pulses of alkaline magmatic 

activity. 

 
• The first of these pulses occurred between 94-88 Ma and is limited to 

sills in the Lisbon region (Foz da Fonte and Paço d’Ilhas). The second pulse 

involved a larger volume of magma and took place between 75-72 Ma. It has a 

wider geographical distribution (? 37 to 39º N) and more diverse modes of 

occurrence such as subvolcanic complexes (Sines, Monchique and the Cabo da Roca 

complex in Sintra), flows, necks, plugs, dykes and sills (LVC, Loulé lamprophyres). 

 
• U-Pb dating of zircon separates from the Sintra granite gives an 79.2 ± 

0.8 Ma age, which although equivalent, within error, to the oldest age obtained for 

the syenite (78.3 ± 1.9 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987), is still older than the other K-Ar 

ages obtained for these rocks (76.4 ± 1.4 and 76.1 ± 1.1 Ma, Storetvedt et al., 1987). 

This, combined with the observed field cross-cutting relations and geophysical data 

(gravimetry and AMS, Terrinha et al., 2003), allows us to speculate that the granite 



 

320 
 

corresponds to an older laccolith that is intruded by a more recent gabbro to syenite 

suite. 

 
Petrography and Mineral Chemistry: 

 
• Field, textural and mineral and whole rock chemistry data indicate that 

the Pedras Negras gabbro in the Sines igneous complex formed by the accumulation 

of mafic minerals (mostly olivine and clinopyroxene) on the bottom of a magma 

chamber. The Praia Vasco da Gama gabbro in the same complex should in its turn 

represent a higher level of the same magma chamber, which is supported by textural 

and whole rock geochemistry evidence. The fact that the deeper level of the magma 

chamber represented by the Pedras Negras gabbro outcrops at the same altitude than 

its shallower counterpart (Praia Vasco da Gama gabbro) can be due to the uplift on 

the northern block accommodated by the E-W fault that cross cuts the complex. 

 

• Petrographic evidence shows that the earlier minerals to crystallize 

are Cr-rich spinels, followed by olivine and Fe-Ti oxides and then by 

clinopyroxene, plagioclase and amphibole. 

 
• The precipitation and removal of olivine led to the decrease of MgO 

and Ni and an increase of FeO in the residual melt, which is reflected in the 

progressive increase of the fayalite content in the olivines. The decreasing 

amounts of CaO and MnO in the olivines, with increasing Fa contents, are 

associated to the onset of clinopyroxene, plagioclase and possibly Fe-Ti oxides 

crystallization. 

 
• The importance of crystal accumulation processes in the genesis of 

the Sines gabbros was reinforced by the observation that their ????/??
??????  value did 

not reflect equilibrium between the composition of the olivines and the analyzed 

whole rock composition. 

 

• Crystallization temperatures obtained for olivine vary between 1250º C 

in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug and 1150 ºC for the and Negrais lava flow. The 

temperatures for plagioclase crystallization (? 900º C for the Ribeira d’Ilhas plug 



 

321 
 

and 970º C for the Negrais flow) and for equilibrium amphibole-plagioclase pairs 

are lower, confirming that these are late magmatic phases. 

 
• Most of the clinopyroxenes present in the analyzed rocks are Ca-rich 

diopsides and augites. In general, the clinopyroxene compositions evolve towards 

terms that are more enriched in FeO (ferrosilitic molecule; Fe2Si2O6) and Na2O, 

while becoming progressively depleted in MgO. Some of the more Fe-rich 

clinopyroxenes classify as hedenbergites and, when Na2O rich as aegirine-augites. 

 
• Two different types of clinopyroxene phenocrysts were identified. One 

with normal zoning, consisting of a pink to purple core and a rim with a darker 

shade of the same color. The second type shows a green core and a pink to purple 

rim. 

 
• The green cored clinopyroxenes phenocrysts show reverse zoning, with 

the cores being more Fe3+, and Na rich and Mg and Ti poor than their rims and 

mantles. These cores also show higher Alvi which are indicative of crystallization at 

higher pressures. This suggests that the reverse zonation results from the mixture 

between a more evolved and a more basic magma at depth, both being of alkaline 

nature and thus possibly genetically related. The differences in composition between 

the green cores of the reversely zoned phenocrysts of basic rocks and the green 

clinopyroxenes of the Monchique nepheline syenite imply that the more evolved 

liquid would not be phonolitic but possibly intermediate, such as a tephri-phonolite 

or phono-tephrite. 

 
• There are compositional similarities between the clinopyroxenes in the 

xenoliths and the green cores of the reversely zoned phenocrysts, suggesting a 

common origin. 

 
• Like the clinopyroxenes, some of the plagioclases in the basic rocks also 

show reverse zoning, which is further evidence for the occurrence of magma mixing 

at depth.  

 
• Average crystallization temperatures for plagioclases are lower than the 

ones obtained for olivines, which is in agreement with this mineral being a later 



 

322 
 

phase in the crystallization sequence. Crystallization temperatures for crystal cores 

of gabbroic rocks vary between ?1100º C in the Mafra gabbro to 910º C in the 

Monchique gabbro, with Sines and Sintra showing intermediate temperatures ( 1070 

and 960º C, respectively) and the more evolved sills showing even lower 

temperatures (960-900º C). Matrix crystals from basic rocks show relatively high 

temperatures (1040 to 900º C) as a result of their fast growth under rapid cooling 

conditions. 

 
• The amphiboles found in the studied samples are mostly kaersutites and 

pargasites. Some show reverse zoning, providing aditional evidence for the 

occurrence of magma mixing processes. Secondary magnesio-horneblende occurs in 

the Sintra gabbros. 

 
• Amphibole-plagioclase equilibrium temperatures are in agreement with 

the ones calculated for plagioclase alone and reinforce the late character of both 

these phases. They vary between ? 1010, 1030, 1000 and 910º C for the Mafra, 

Sines, Monchique and Sintra gabbros and 890º C in the amygdulae of the Ribeira 

d’Ilhas plug. 

 
• Compositional similarities between amphibole xenocrysts, amphiboles in 

the xenoliths and the cores of the reversely zoned phenocrysts found in the Malveira 

da Serra sill suggest a common origin for these phases. 

 
• The majority of the analyzed oxides are titanomagnetites but there are 

also rare, early chromian spinels, often included in olivine. In addition to these 

phases, some magnetite and ilmenite were identified in large exsolved crystals 

which are more common in the intrusive rocks. These exsolved crystals were likely 

originally titanomagnetites as well. The predominance of spinels from the 

ulvospinel-magnetite solid solution series is a consequence of the low silica activity 

(?????) of the silica undersaturated alkaline magmas from which they formed. 

Individual ilmenite crystals are only found in the more evolved, contaminated and 

SiO2 rich sills like Paço d’Ilhas and Montelevar. 

 
• The crystallization of the earlier spinels (chromite to chromian 

titanomagnetite and titanomagnetites) must have taken place at relatively high 



 

323 
 

oxygen fugacity conditions, above the NNO buffer, since solid solution between 

aluminous and Fe-Ti spinels seems to be possible only under such conditions. 

 
• With increasing differentiation, the spinels became richer in TiO2, which 

can be attributed to a decrease in fO2 of these low ????? magmas. This decrease is 

confirmed by the values obtained for the exsolved ilmenite-magnetite pairs in the 

gabbros and basaltic rocks which are generally below the NNO buffer. 

 
• The Sintra gabbros show the highest oxigen fO2 values for the magnetite-

ilmenite exsolution pairs, which is probably a result of subsolidus equilibration 

during the secondary alteration event that affected the gabbros in this complex. 

 
• The calculated blocking temperatures for the exsolved ilmenite-magnetite 

pairs are quite low, both for the intrusive and extrusive rocks, suggesting subsolidus 

equilibration under relatively slow cooling conditions in both environments. 

Blocking temperatures vary between 500 and 600º C in the Negrais lava flow and 

Sines gabbro, go up to 640º C in the Monchique gabbro and 770º C in the Sintra 

gabbro. The highest blocking temperatures were calculated for the Montelevar sill 

(? 770º C) and for the oxides in the reaction rim of an amphibole megacryst in the 

Ribeira d’Ilhas plug (? 850º C). 

 
• Kaersutite xenocrysts are interpreted to represent the products of high 

pressure crystallization (&gt; 15 kbar) of a similar basic, hydrous alkaline melt, formed 

within a deep conduit or chamber, and that therefore did not aggregate into 

xenoliths. As the magmas ascended, the pressure dropped, and the volatiles 

exsolved, the amphibole xenocrysts became unstable and started developing the 

observed clinopyroxene+plagioclase+Fe-Ti oxide reaction rims. 

 
• The existence of reversely zoned clinopyroxenes, amphiboles, 

plagioclase and xenoliths, sometimes even in the same outcrop, can be interpreted as 

evidence for the occurrence of magma mixing preceding the emplacement of the 

magmas at higher levels. All these are relatively evolved and can be interpreted as 

being the crystallization products from similar alkaline melts of intermediate nature. 

 



 

324 
 

• The magma mixing event must have taken place at high depth, given the 

higher Alvi content of the green cores in clinopyroxenes and the stability conditions 

for kaersutite. Such depths are likely to correspond to boundaries between layers 

with strong density contrasts, such as the crust-mantle boundary or the Conrad 

discontinuity within the crust. 

 
• The green clinopyroxene cores, the evolved amphibole cores and 

megacrysts and the evolved plagioclase cores are thought to represent phases 

crystallizing in the middle of the chamber or conduit that contained the more 

evolved magma that mixed with the basic melt. In their turn, the xenoliths 

containing minerals with similar compositions could represent cumulus or wall rock 

assemblages in that chamber or conduit that had previously crystallized from the 

same evolved magma and were remobilized once that chamber was recharged with 

the basic melt.  

 
 

Elemental and Isotope Geochemistry: 

 
• All of the sampled rocks classify as alkaline and most of them belong to 

the potassic series, although some of them plot in the sodic field of the classification 

by Middlemost (1975), mostly due to the accumulation of Na-rich phases. They are 

trace element enriched in relation to the primitive mantle.  

 
• Major and trace element abundance in cumulate rocks is controlled by 

the respective cumulate mineral assemblage and degree of fractionation. This is 

more evident in intrusive rocks, such as the Sines and Sintra gabbros and the Paço 

d’Ilhas sill. 

 
• The magmatic evolution follows two distinct differentiation trends from 

an initial ultrabasic/basic alkaline melt. The silica oversaturated trend seems to be 

predominant, being common to the LVC, Sintra and Sines igneous complexes, while 

the SiO2 undersaturated trend only occurs in the Monchique igneous complex and is 

also represented by the Eiras do Faião sill, which is integrated in the LVC. 

 
• All the samples show fractionated REE patterns, which is illustrated by 

high LaN/YbN (48.9 – 8.8) and TbN/YbN (3.4-1.9). This can be interpreted as 



 

325 
 

resulting from the presence of residual garnet during the melting events, which 

implies that melting must have taken place deeper than 60 km. 

 
• The studied samples show relatively low 87Sr/86Sri (0.703005 to 

0.704884) and high ?Ndi (5.8 to2.8). 

 
• Pb isotopes show compositions (206Pb/204Pbi, 18.827-19.564, 207Pb/204Pbi 

15.567-15.634, 208Pb/204Pbi 38.603-39.948) that are more enriched than DMM, but 

less enriched than HIMU, defining a compositional array close to the NHRL and to 

the FOZO component. Samples for the Fontanelas seamount show much higher 
208Pb/204Pbi values than the remaining samples, probably due to secondary alteration 

processes which changed the Th/Pb and U/Pb ratios of these rocks and prevented the 

application of proper corrections for radioactive decay. 

 
• Basic, uncontaminated samples show a more reduced compositional 

range in Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sri  0.7030-0.7037; ?Ndi 5.7 – 3.7; 
206Pb/204Pbi 19.564-19.20, 207Pb/204Pbi 15.609-15.580, 208Pb/204Pbi 39.245-39.00). 

There are no perceptible differences in the isotopic compositions of the rocks from 

the two different magmatic pulses, which means that the composition of the mantle 

of the WIM can be considered as being reasonably stable and homogenous between 

94 and 72 Ma.  

 
• The basic, unfractionated samples seem to have resulted from very low 

amounts of partial melting (1-6 %) of enriched mantle sources. The sources for the 

Loulé lamprophyres, Foz da Fonte sill and remaining unfractionated basic rocks 

(mostly from the LVC and Fontanelas seamount) are different in terms of the degree 

of enrichment and of residual mineralogy. The source of the lamprophyres is 

substantially more LREE enriched, while the Foz da Fonte sill lacks residual 

amphibole in its source. 

 
• The Sr and Nd isotopic signatures of the basic uncontaminated rocks 

suggest a time integrated depletion in Rb and Nd relative to Sr and Sm, respectively. 

This is in contrast with the incompatible trace element enriched nature of these 

rocks. Such a discrepancy can be attributed to a mantle metasomatism event took 

place shortly before magma generation, which means that the isotopic ratios of this 



 

326 
 

metasomatized source did not have sufficient time to evolve into a more 

significantly enriched and heterogenous composition. 

 
• The isotopic signature of uncontaminated rocks is compatible with a 

sublithospheric origin for these magmas. Their composition plots between the range 

defined by the HIMU and DMM components, near FOZO, in Sr-Nd, and Pb-Pb 

isotopic variation diagrams and shows similarities to the offshore occurrences of 

Late Cretaceous age (MTR and Ormonde). 

 
• The uncontaminated samples show an isotopic composition that is within 

the range of compositions shown by samples derived from the activity of the 

Canaries mantle plume, suggesting that the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmas of the 

WIM probably resulted from the activity of the same plume. Magmas derived from 

this mantle plume also show FOZO like Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic signatures. 

However, He and Os isotopic data for samples from the Canary islands point a 

model involving the dilution of a HIMU plume component in the a DMM 

(asthenospheric?) component.  

 
• Primitive mantle normalized multielemental diagrams confirm the trace 

element enriched character of these rocks and show some features that are common 

to all the studied samples, such as positive Nb and Ta anomalies. 

 
• These diagrams also allowed for the identification of distinct features in 

the trace element patterns of the two pulses of Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatic 

activity. Basic samples from the second pulse show negative K, Zr, Hf and 

sometimes Ti anomalies, which are absent in unfractionated basic samples of the 

first pulse. 

 
• These negative anomalies are thought to reflect the action of a 

metasomatic event which modified the original mantle mineralogy and chemical 

composition. 

 
• The negative K anomalies are attributed to the presence of residual 

amphibole during melting, which buffered K concentrations in the resulting 

magmas. Amphibole is only stable at temperature conditions correspondent to the 



 

327 
 

lithospheric mantle and therefore should reflect the action of volatile rich 

metasomatic fluids in the lithosphere or the equilibration of magmas with 

metasomatized lithospheric mantle domains. 

 
• Negative anomalies in Zr, Hf and Ti are thought to reflect the action of 

carbonatitic or CO2 rich melts that metasomatized the mantle before the melting 

event that generated the magmas of the second pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline 

activity. 

 
• The composition of the metasomatic agent is likely to be gradational, 

from a carbonatitic to a volatile rich siliceous melt. However, the high Zr/Hf and 

low Ti/Eu at high La/Yb point towards an important carbonatitic contribution. 

 
• The source for such a metasomatic agent might have been low degree 

melts from a carbonated peridotite in an ascending mantle plume, such as the 

Canaries mantle plume. These early melts imprinted the plume signature in the 

lithosphere and lowered its fusion temperature. This is supported by the similar 

isotopic signatures observed in both pulses, which allowed for the assignment of a 

common origin for the sublithospheric and for the metasomatic components. 

 
• The contribution of metasomatized mantle to the total volume of 

produced melt decreases with increasing degrees of melting, as the rocks that derive 

from higher amounts of fusion show lower Zr/Hf, La/Yb and higher Ti/Eu. This 

means that the melts from the metasomatized source were progressively diluted in 

asthenospheric plume related melts. 

 
• Since this metasomatic signature is only detected in rocks from the 

second pulse, it is likely that the metasomatic event is contemporary of the first 

pulse of magmatic alkaline activity (94-88 Ma) or that it occurred just before the 

formation of the magmas from the second pulse. 

 
• Most of the studied samples represent somewhat fractionated magmas 

since they do not fit the criteria to classify as unfractionated primary magmas. This 

is an indicator for the existence of important fractionation at depth. 

 



 

328 
 

• The magmatic evolution of the samples from the LVC appears to have 

been controlled by assimilation and fractional crystallization (AFC) processes. The 

fractionating assemblage which better reproduces the evolution trend seen in these 

rocks is constituted by clinopyroxene (55%) + olivine (20%) + plagioclase (17.5%) 

+ magnetite (7.5%). 

 
• Assimilation of upper crustal lithologies is thought to have occurred 

concurrently with crystal fractionation in order to create the observed trace element 

and isotopic signatures. Two main AFC trends are observed, one characterized by 

the progressive increase in Th/La, Zr/Nb, K/Nb, 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb, and 

decrease in (Gd/Lu)N, Nb/U, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb with 

increasing SiO2. This trend seems to be common to most of the contaminated and 

evolved samples and is thought to reflect assimilation of an upper crustal, siliceous, 

rock. 

 
• The other AFC trend is characterized by increasing 87Sr/86Sr and 

relatively unchanged trace element as well as ?Ndi and Pb isotopic ratios in the 

contaminated rocks, which also possess relatively low SiO2 contents. This trend is 

thought to be the result of the assimilation of small amounts of Sr rich but Nd and 

Pb depleted contaminant, such as carbonate material. 

 
• The gabbros of the Sintra and Sines igneous complexes show apparently 

contaminated Pb isotopic signatures along with uncontaminated Sr and Nd isotopic 

ratios. Such a signature is likely to be the result of secondary hydrothermal 

alteration by Pb rich fluids. 

 
• Mineral chemistry data supports the existence of magma mixing at depth 

for some of the magmas of the second pulse of the Late Cretaceous alkaline activity. 

However, geochemical modeling seems to show that this process is of little 

importance in creating the petrological diversity observed in these rocks, with 

fractional crystallization and assimilation appearing to be the most important 

processes. 

 
• The mixing and homogenization of a basic, primitive magma with small 

portions of a more evolved, volatile rich liquid probably led to the formation of a 



 

329 
 

melt that retained its basic nature but suffered a reduction in density and an increase 

in the volatile content. This resulted in the pressurization of the system, leading to 

rapid ascension and installation of the magmas.  

 

• As the volatile rich magma approached the surface, the volatiles would 

start to exsolve due to decompression, generating explosive eruptions such as the 

ones that happened before every effusive phase in the LVC. 

 
 

Wider geodynamical implications: 

 
• The timing and location, and even certain geochemical characteristics of 

the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism in the WIM seems to be associated with 

local structure and changes in the kinematics of the Iberian plate.  

 

• The absence of a metasomatic signature materialized by negative 

negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies during the first pulse of Late Cretaceous alkaline 

activity in the onshore WIM (94-88 Ma) could be related to a more favorable stress 

field during the contemporaneous rotation of Iberia which permitted the quick 

ascent of the magmas generated in an ascending plume.  

 
• During the second pulse (75-72 Ma) some of the samples show a 

metasomatic signature characterized by negative K, Zr and Hf anomalies. The 

presence of such a signature is associated with the contemporaneous onset of the 

rapid collision between the African and Iberian plates and the initiation of inversion 

in the Mesozoic basins which created an unfavorable stress regime, and restraining 

the opening of fractures and quick magmatic ascent. This favored interaction with 

subcontinental lithosphere and either resulted in the metasomatism and fusion of its 

lowermost part, or allowed for the melting and incorporation of lithosphere 

metasomatized during the first pulse.  

 
• The lack of an age progression for the Late Cretaceous alkaline 

magmatism of the onshore and offshore WIM suggests that this magmatism is not 

simply controlled by the translation of Iberia over an individual hot spot. Instead, 

this fact suggests that the magmatism and its emplacement is associated with various 



 

330 
 

factors, such as the changes in Iberian plate kinematics, pre-existing Variscan and 

Mesozoic rifting faults of and the large size of the hot mantle anomaly. The 

occurrence of the MTR seamounts (103 to 80 Ma) along the ocean-continent 

transitional domain suggests this acted as a northerly trending major deep rooted 

shear zone probably active during the rotation of Iberia. 

 

• From 80 Ma to the end of the Cretaceous, the offshore magmatism in the 

WIM seems to be limited to the Ormonde peak of the Gorringe bank (? 65 Ma) 

although the NW Tore seamount shows a 80.5 Ma age. On the other hand, this was 

the time when magmatism was most abundant in the onshore WIM, which might 

reflect the drift of continental Iberia over an anomalous, hotter area of the mantle.  

 

• The smaller volume magma produced in the onshore, when compared 

with the offshore is probably associated with the higher thickness of the lithosphere 

in this region, which reduced the quantity of produced magma and/or 

accommodated the intrusions at various levels of discontiniuties. 

 

• During their ascension, magmas appear to have taken advantage of a 

series of pre-existing structures, related with the Variscan orogeny and/or with 

Mesozoic rifting.  

 
• The emplacement of the magmatic bodies in upper crustal levels, 

occurred at the intersection of the WNW-ESE to E-W rift transfer faults with NE-

SW and NNW-SSE fault systems, both of which consist of reactivations of 

Paleozoic fauls. Some of these WNW-ESE to E-W, which are sub-parallel to the 

oceanic transform faults, appear to be major lithospheric discontinuities that 

controlled the magma emplacement and transport along large areas, such as the 

Tore-Sintra fault in the Estremadura spur. 

 

• As a corollary, it is concluded that the timing, location and certain 

geochemical characteristics of the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism in the WIM 

are associated with the regional crustal/lithospheric structure and changes in the 

kinematics of the Iberian plate and its overall motion over the Canary hot spot.

10. Suggestions for future work 
 

• Collection of further geochronological data on the LVC, many of the 

small volume occurrences it is associated with (sills, plugs and dykes), the Mafra 

radial dyke complex, the Cascais dykes, the Fontanelas seamount and some  of the 

basic alkaline occurrences in Algarve basin would allow for a refinement of the 

timing of this magmatism and dispel doubts over the occurrence of an age 

progression or several pulses of activity for this event, as well as provide a better 

frame for the relation between the Late Cretaceous alkaline magmatism of the WIM 

and its contemporaneous geodynamic context. 

 

• A more complete geochronological dataset would also allow to better 

constrain the timing of the metasomatic processes that took place before the 

emplacement and extrusion of certain Late Cretaceous alkaline occurrences. 

 

• The characteristics of this metasomatic event could be known in more 

detail if the more basic, uncontaminated lithologies are sampled and studied. To 

avoid problems with the composition of the rocks being modified by crystal 

accumulation, matrix separates should be prepared and analyzed instead of whole 

rock samples. 

 

• Detailed mapping of the Sines and Sintra complexes and their dyke 

complexes in order to distinguish different facies among the already identified 

lithologies and understand the relation between mafic, intermediate and felsic 

outcrops and between these and the dykes they are intruded by. This, accompanied 

with further geochemical and geochronologic data, would lead to improvements in 

the emplacement histories and evolution mechanisms of these complexes. 

 

• This detailed mapping would also allow for the in depth study of the 

crystal fractionation and accumulation processes in these complexes through whole 

rock and mineral chemistry analyzes, namely if the different types of gabbro really 

do represent different levels of the same magma chamber. 

 



 

332 
 

• Comprehensive sampling and mineral chemistry study of the xenoliths 

present in this province, namely in the Ribeira d’Ilhas plugs and Eiras do Faião sill. 

This would allow a better characterization of the crystallization conditions, 

including parental melt composition, depth and temperature. It would also provide 

new information on the relation between these xenoliths and the magmas where they 

are contained. 

 

• Detailed mineral chemistry, including in situ trace elements and isotopic 

analysis made by LA-ICP-MS of the xenocrysts that show reverse zoning and are 

evidence for the occurrence of magma mixing at depth. This would result in a better 

understanding of the crystallization conditions and composition of the parental 

magma of these cores. 

 

• Sampling, geochemical and geochronological analyses of the remaining 

seamounts between Fontanelas and Tore and of the seamounts NW of Tore between 

this seamount and the King’s Trough. This would allow the characterization of these 

rocks and determine whether they are associated with the same Late Cretaceous 

Alkaline episode in the WIM associated with the Canaries plume, or if they are 

related to any other context. 

 

• The collection of paleomagnetic data on the dated rocks would also 

improve the paleogeographic reconstitutions of Iberia during the Late Cretaceous 

and allow for a better assessment of geodynamic context contemporaneous of the 

studied magmatic episode.
