Resumo 

A Eletrodinâmica Estocástica (SED) é uma versão moderna da Eletrodinâmica Clássica, 

cuja principal inovação é a inclusão de um fundo eletromagnético aleatório à temperatura 

zero. Esta teoria tem descrito alguns fenómenos atómicos, até agora apenas explicados 

pela Mecânica Quântica. A SED sugere que as energias dos níveis atómicos são pré-

determinadas pelo campo de ponto zero (ZPF). Assim, uma vez que as cavidades de 

Casimir suprimem alguns dos modos do ZPF, os átomos dentro dessas cavidades poderão 

sofrer desvios energéticos quer no estado fundamental quer no excitado. Desse modo, a 

comutação de átomos entre o espaço livre e cavidades de Casimir poderá levar à emissão 

de radiação ou a um ganho em energia nas suas propriedades radiativas. Este excesso de 

energia é fornecido pelo ZPF, que á saída da cavidade devolve aos átomos o desvio 

inicialmente sofrido conferindo-lhes as orbitas características do espaço livre. Com base 

nesta hipótese, começamos a nossa investigação estudando computacionalmente a 

interação do átomo de Hidrogénico clássico com ZPF, caracteristico do espaço livre e de 

uma cavidade de Casimir. Para isso, integramos numericamente o movimento do eletrão 

na sua orbita utilizando um modelo em duas dimensões já documentado, e desenvolvemos 

nós próprios um modelo em três dimensões. Estimamos também, o desvio do estado 

fundamental do átomo de Hidrogénio dentro de uma cavidade de Casimir, fazendo para 

isso uma aproximação ao oscilador harmónico. Feitos estes estudos teóricos e 

computacionais, propusemos um método experimental para medir o desvio energético 

nos níveis atómicos de átomos ao passarem por cavidades de Casimir. Projetamos e 

montamos um sistema experimental que permitiu passar gases através de cavidades de 

Casimir constituídas por membranas nano-porosas evaporadas com alumínio. O sistema, 

feito de aço-inox, foi conectado a dois monocromadores que nos permitiram irradiar o 

gás com uma frequência específica, e também, usando um PMT, fazer uma análise 

espectroscopia da radiação emitida. De seguida, fizemos uma análise espectroscópica de 

150 a 550 nm, registando a radiação emitida por átomos de Xe ao passarem por 

membranas nano-porosas, onde algumas evidências de radiação foram observadas, no 

entanto, é necessário um estudo mais cuidadoso no futuro. Por ultimo, também testamos 

algumas hipóteses alternativas, excitando previamente os átomos de Xe, no entanto, não 

fomos capazes de distinguir qualquer radiação imitida do ruido de fundo. Concluímos 

ainda que o sistema não é suficientemente sensível nos comprimentos de onda desejados, 

maioritariamente devido ao PMT usado. Finalmente, concluímos o nosso trabalho 

sugerindo algumas melhorias.

Abstract 

Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED) is a modern version of classic electrodynamics whose 

principal innovation is the inclusion of a random electromagnetic zero-point field 

background. This theory has described some atomic effects, until now only explained by 

quantum mechanics. The SED suggests that the atomic level energies are predetermined 

by the zero-point field (ZPF). Since a Casimir cavity suppresses some ZPF modes, the 

atoms inside such cavity could undergo level shifts in their ground and exited states. 

Switching ground or excited atoms between Casimir cavities and the free space can lead 

to the hypothetical detection of radiation or an energetic gain in their radiative properties. 

This excess of energy comes from the ZPF which returns the shifted energy of the atomic 

orbits to the initial values when the atoms return to the free space. Based on this 

hypothesis, we start our investigation by studding the classic hydrogen atom interaction 

with the free space and with the ZPF cavity by computational means. We numerically 

integrate the electron motion in its orbit using an already documented two-dimensional 

model and developed ourselves a three-dimensional model. We also estimate the shift in 

the ground state of the hydrogen atom inside a Casimir cavity, approximating it to the 

harmonic oscillator. After this theoretical and computational evaluation, we propose an 

experimental method to measure the energy shift in the atomic levels of an atom of gas 

when flowing through a Casimir cavity. We projected and mounted an experimental 

apparatus which allows passing gases through Casimir cavities constituted by nano-

porous metal coated membranes. The system, made of stainless steel, was connected to 

two monochromators which allow irradiating the gas with a specific wavelength and 

making a spectroscopic analysis of the emitted radiation using a Photomultiplier tube. We 

performed a spectroscopic analysis for wavelengths ranging from 150 to 550 nm, 

recording the radiation emitted by Xe atoms passing through nano-porous membranes, 

where some radiation evidences were observed, however a more careful study is required 

in the future. We also tested some alternative hypothesis, exciting the Xenon atoms, but 

we could not distinguish the expected radiation emitted from the background noise. We 

conclude that the system is not sensitive in the required wavelength, mostly due to the 

PMT used. Finally, we conclude our work suggesting some improvements.

1. Introduction 

In the XVII century it was believed that if we extract all the solid material and gases 

contained in a volume we would have a completely empty space, the vacuum. Over time 

the vacuum concept changed and, in the XIX century, it was noticed that the thermic 

radiation would persist. So the vacuum concept got one more requisite, zero temperature, 

and then the problem was solved. However, in the XX century it was proven theoretical 

and experimentally that even at zero Kelvin there was still energy. For that reason this 

energy was named Zero-Point Energy (ZPE). ZPE takes the form of field fluctuations, 

known Zero-Point Field1 (ZPF) and could be considered the ground state of the vacuum. 

Nikola Tesla was likely the first to propose the existence of such kind of energy and the 

possibility of its use for industrial purposes [1]. After in the end of the XIX century this 

proposal could seem to be inconsistent, nowadays more and more researches are looking 

into this possibility.  

At the realm of Quantum Mechanics (QM), the ZPF existence is often attributed to 

the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. According to this principle, if we are interested in 

the measurement of any two conjugate observables (such as the position and the 

momentum), A and B, they must obey to the commutation relation [?, ?] = ?? (where ? 

is the reduced Planck’s constant). Being ?? and ?? respectively the A and B observable 

variances, their uncertainty relation will be ???? ? ?/2. If we measure A with high 

precision then the measurement of B will be less precise. Thereby there cannot be a state 

in which the system sits motionless at the bottom of its potential well, for which its 

position and momentum would both be determined with great precision. Hence the 

ground state of a system must have a distribution in position and momentum satisfying 

the uncertainty principle (???? ? ?/2). This implies that the system must have energy 

greater than the minimum of the potential well, being this ground state energy the ZPE 

[2]. 

In addition to these theoretical predictions of the existence of the ZPF, some 

experimental evidences, such as the spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, and the 

Casimir forces, seem also to be a consequence of the ZPF [3]. For example, the Casimir 

                                                 
1 The term ZPF is related to all the field fluctuations, even with forces other than the electromagnetic. 

However in this document whenever we refer to the ZPF we are only considering the electromagnetic 

ZPF since we only deal with electromagnetic forces.

force, which was studied in detail in the last years [4], is often related with the perturbation 

induced in the ZPF by two conductive parallel plates. According to such scenario, some 

modes of the ZPF’s electromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed by the boundary 

conditions imposed by the plates, inducing an attractive force between them, due to the 

difference between the outer and inner electromagnetic pressures. The possibility of 

extracting energy and heat from the ZPF by means of the Casimir force was theoretically 

demonstrated, without the violation of any thermodynamic law [5]. However, a 

symmetric attractive force between two objects cannot be used to continually extract ZPF 

energy since the same amount of energy is needed to separate again the objects. For now 

it is pure speculation the existence of a functional method to use this energy in a recycling 

cycle. 

Early in the last century, personalities such as Einstein and Planck made efforts to 

study the interaction between the electromagnetic oscillator and the radiation. However, 

over the years the attentions were diverted to QM. Still, in the second half of the XX 

century, the classical treatment was reviewed, at this time including a missing key point 

in the previous formulations: the existence of a random electromagnetic background 

identical to MQ’s ZPF. This original classical theory is known by Stochastic 

Electrodynamics (SED) and has solved some atomic problems such as the orbital 

instability, the particle motion at zero temperature, the Casimir and van der Waals forces, 

among others [6]. While for QM the ZPF is a derived result, for SED it is a direct 

consequence of a fundamental assumption. Thus, and mathematically speaking, SED is 

nothing more than the use of the relativistic version of the motion classic laws (Newton 

second law) with an electromagnetic random background described by Maxwell’s 

equations.  

From the point of view of SED, the electron in a classic orbit around the nucleus 

radiates (Larmor radiation) constantly, consequence of its self-reaction. However it also 

absorbs power from the ZPF, being therefore possible that the atom has a stable averaged-

orbit. In other words, it is the spectral ZPF’s form which determines the ground state 

energy of the atomic systems (and possibly determines also the energy levels of the 

excited states too) [7]. Hence, it is reasonable to think that, if we somewhat change the 

ZPF (for example suppressing some resonant modes using a Casimir cavity2), the atoms 

will undergo a level shift. This is the main idea studied in our work. Based on these level 

                                                 
2 A Casimir cavity is in this document understood as a region in space where the ZPF is modified often by 

the presence of some kind of conductive boundary, which suppress some ZPF’s modes.

shifts, it could be possible to use a method to extract energy from the ZPF in a continuous 

cycle, as already proposed in other documents [2] [8].  In this work, we propose a more 

elaborated concept, exploring also the shifts in excited states and their related atomic 

transitions.  

Until now, the reader could still have a fundamental question: “If there is a ZPF, why 

don’t we detect this radiation?” The answer is simple: if this background is homogeneous, 

isotropic and is everywhere, even inside our measuring devices, they can’t distinguish 

this radiation from some internal reference.  For example, according to SED all the atoms 

are constantly radiating Larmor radiation, however we don’t detect this radiation because 

all the atoms are also absorbing the same radiation and no net energy transference exists 

across a surface [6]. 

SED being more intuitive for our purposes than Quantum Electrodynamics3 (QED), 

it will be our theoretical basis. Since it is a very immature theory, we were forced to 

attempt making some theoretical predictions related with our experimental method by 

means of computational simulation. However, some effects explored in this work can be 

seen from a QM point of view, usually related to the well-known Casimir-Polder/van der 

Waals forces (these ones were also successfully explained in the SED framework [9][10]). 

For a deeper study of this subject, the reader can use the following references: for 

theoretical and computational studies about atom-surface interaction potential see 

[11][12][13][14][15][16][17]; for experimental Casimir-Polder/van der Waals forces, 

measurements and detection of modifications in radiative properties induced by boundary 

conditions, see [18][19][20][21][22][23][24]; and for some reviews about the Casimir-

Polder/van der Waals theory and experiments see [25][26][4].  

In the present work, after making a brief review of the literature, we were able to 

implement some computational methods already documented, replicating the same 

results. Furthermore, we found some conceptual and computational failures of these 

methods, never reported until now in the literature (at least from our knowledge). We 

tried to improve these methods developing, for example, a full 3D computational model 

of the hydrogen atom in the SED framework. We adapted algorithms already existent and 

our own algorithms to study the electron behaviour in the hydrogen atom immersed in a 

modified ZPF, since we cannot find such study in the literature. For the hydrogen atom, 

approximating it to the harmonic oscillator, we first study its equilibrium radius for the 

                                                 
3 QED treats the electromagnetic ZPF as virtual photons, while in the SED realm these fluctuations are 

seen as real electromagnetic waves, making this concept more intuitive.

free space by numerical means, obtaining the same result (already documented) as using 

analytical means. Next, we make the same for a modified ZPF cavity, being possible to 

confirm the expected equilibrium radius decreasing for smaller cavities. Despite the 

previous advances (discovers and algorithm improvements which can be used in future 

works to study new atomic systems) in the literature, we also contribute to science with 

experimental investigation:  

1) we make a qualitative analysis of the radiation emitted from ground-state atoms 

passing through Casimir cavities for higher energies, in contrast with the 

quantitative analysis for lower energies already made in the past;  

2) we propose and implement experimentally a new concept, which involves the 

excitation of the previous atoms, to study the radiative shifts in level transitions 

induced by Casimir cavities. 

In chapter 2 we introduce SED with special focus on the Hydrogen atom. In that 

chapter, we attempt to treat the Hydrogen atom in the SED framework by means of 

numerical integration using a one-dimensional ZPF. Next, in chapter 3, we discuss the 

ZPF computational generation methods focusing in a 3D ZPF topology. With this more 

credible method to generate the ZPF, and using approximations related with the harmonic 

oscillator, we estimate the averaged ground-state radius variation induced by the 

immersion of a Hydrogen atom in a modified ZPF cavity. Lastly in chapter 3, we develop 

and test a 3D model of the Hydrogen atom in the SED realm, using a 3D ZPF. In chapter 

4, we schematize a conceptual method to extract energy from the ZPF taking into account 

the effects studied in the previous chapters. There we make some references to previous 

works, propose possible improvements and discuss different hypothesis and 

correspondent application ideas. In the end of the chapter we present some experimental 

limitations which can influence the theoretical methods. In chapter 5, we propose an 

experimental apparatus to study the hypothesis presented in the previous chapter. We give 

some details about the experiment instrumentation and finish the chapter with some 

simulations of physical effects which take place in the experiment. In chapter 6, we 

present the experimental results: from the preliminary tests to the main experiment. 

Finally we discuss the results and suggest future improvements and new experiments.  

1.1. Objectives 

In this work we intend to study the remote possibility of extracting energy from the 

vacuum. We do not intend to project an industrial system but only to develop an 



5 

 

experimental method and apparatus to validate our hypothesis, which have their 

foundations in SED [6].  

We intend to study ground-state shifts in atoms induced by Casimir cavities. For this 

we will force the flow of gases (monoatomic and polyatomic) through metal-coated 

membranes with pores of the order of a few tens of nanometres. At the same time, we 

will make a spectral analysis of the radiation emitted in the UV and part of the visible 

regions. To study some radiative shifts in atomic transitions, we also intend to excite the 

gases with UV radiation and analyse the radiation emitted from those that pass through 

the porous membrane. Lastly we will study the shift in the molecular ground state induced 

by the Casimir cavity. For this, we intend to dissociate the molecules before they enter 

the membrane and analyse the radiation emitted by the ones that recombine inside the 

pores. 

1.2. Motivation 

The conceptual importance of the development of SED is in itself great since this 

model intends to be a unified theory. It is even more fundamental than QM since SED is 

a dynamical description of the atomic systems while QM is seen as an averaged 

description [27][28]. This consequently means also a better understanding of the QM 

which could lead to advances in technologic areas as quantum computation and 

superconductive materials, among others. 

Despite this, our main motivation is to study the possibility of developing a method 

to extract energy from an almost inexhaustible source, available everywhere. If we 

integrate all the ZPF’s modes until the Planck frequency (1043 Hz), the computed energy 

density of the vacuum is in the 10113 J m3?  order of magnitude, greater than any known 

energy source and also greater than the actual technological requirements [2]. 

The rising needs of energy in our society, the ending of the oil reservoirs and the 

dangers of nuclear power plants may lead to an energetic crisis. It‘s clear the enormous 

need to study new energy sources capable of satisfying the requirements of future 

generations. 

Even this hypothesis being a remote possibility, the science is made of attempts, with 

only a small part of them having success. In this case, the risk is justified by the 

achievement.

1.3. State of art 

In the literature, scientific works about energy extraction from the ZPF are rare. 

However we attempted to collect some information about what was done in this area and 

resume here the most relevant aspects. 

An extensive review was made by Valone and published in the book with ref. [1]. 

This work resumes some of the last attempts to harness the Zero-Point Energy (ZPE), 

either in theoretical concepts or engineering machines. There are also some references 

made to SED and the basic concept explored in the present study.  

Another review about experimental concepts to extract energy from the ZPF was 

made in ref. [2]. There we find also some information about the use of gases in Casimir 

cavities. The main idea is to use the hypothetical ground-state shift (studied in more detail 

in chapter 3 of the present document) of the atoms when they are inside a cavity. As the 

ground-state energy level is predetermined by the ZPF, inside a cavity the new ground 

state of the atom will be different from the one outside and this way it could be possible 

to collect the corresponding energy difference. An attempt to explore this hypothesis was 

carried out by Puthoff et al. (2001) but, according to ref. [2], such investigation was not 

completed. The experimental apparatus allowed passing H2 gas through a 1 ?m Casimir 

cavity suppressing the frequencies resonant with the ground state molecule vibrations. It 

was suggested that, in this scenario, the molecule dissociation energy would increase. To 

prove this hypothesis, the experiment was planned in the Synchrotron Radiation Center 

at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, USA), where an intense UV beam used to 

disassociate the gas molecules could be generated. However, a problem with the 

synchrotron beam made the conclusion of the experiment to be impossible.  

In ref. [29], Puthoff et al., in addition to some exotics concepts about a propulsion 

system to interstellar travels based on ZPF, also mention the shifts in atoms when they 

are inside a Casimir cavity. They also claim to lead experimental investigations about this 

subject in their laboratories but without success so far.  

More recently, in 2012, an attempt was made to detect radiation from ground-state 

gases flowing through porous gold-coated membranes (forming the Casimir cavities). 

This work [8] was not conclusive. However, it presents some interesting results. Because 

of the importance of this work to our study, we will describe it in detail in section 4.1.1. 

Related with this last investigation, there is also a patent [30].

2. Stochastic electrodynamics 

In this chapter, we introduce Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED) with special focus 

in its description of the Hydrogen atom. Then we describe an algorithm for computational 

simulation of this system and, finally, we present results of the implementation of this 

algorithm. 

Here, using a method described in the literature for the first time, we computed the 

orbit radius of the hydrogen atom for longer times and found some inconsistences with 

the theory. 

2.1. Introduction to Stochastic Electrodynamics 

Stochastic Electrodynamics, also named Random Electrodynamics, is basically a 

modern extension of the classic electron theory of Lorentz, and also a continuation of the 

investigations of Einstein, Planck, Nernst and Stern, but with different choices of the 

boundary conditions and the inclusion of the relativity theory [3]. 

According to the SED formulation, particles are described classically as point 

charges interacting with a background of random classical electromagnetic zero-point 

field4 (ZPF) with the energy spectrum described in equation (1), equal to the one used in 

QM [7]. 

 
?(?) =

??3

2?2?3
 (1) 

 

In equation (1), ? is the angular frequency5 of the waves, ? the ligth speed in vacuum 

and ? the reduced Planck constant. This particular spectrum (proportional to ?3) is the 

only one that is Lorentz invariant [7]. The proportionality constant was calculated from 

comparison with experiments on the van der Waals forces, yielding an energy per normal 

mode of 
1

2
??. Then ? does not have any relation with QM or quantization, it is only a 

scale factor [3][31]. Consequently, the ZPF waves can be obtained from the Maxwell’s 

equations as a non-zero homogeneous solution. 

                                                 
4 When we refer to ZPF, it is the zero point field at temperature zero, we are not considering thermal 

radiation effects.  
5 Throughout this document the symbol ? will be always associated to the angular frequency, the reader 
shouldn’t confuse it with frequency.  



8 

 

Even not comparable with the QED success, SED has solved and predicted several 

effects before only explained in the QED realm. Some examples are the Casimir and van 

der Waals forces, the Planck blackbody radiation and the thermal effects of acceleration 

through the vacuum [7]. SED also produced great results in linear systems such as the 

harmonic oscillator. Boyer has shown that the moments ??? ? of a harmonic oscillator 

immersed in the ZPF have the same behaviour than the quantum harmonic oscillator in 

the ground state [32]. That is the same to say that the Heisenberg uncertainty relation is 

satisfied for the SED harmonic oscillator, being its probability distribution the same than 

the QM harmonic oscillator in the ground state [32]. This remarkable result suggests that 

the random character of ZPF leads to the familiar probabilistic behaviour of QM, making 

SED a good candidate to expand our comprehension of the nature fundamentals. QM also 

predicts for the harmonic oscillator a discrete multi-resonance spectrum at the harmonics 

of the oscillator natural frequency [33], while the ordinary classical harmonic oscillator 

supports however a single resonance frequency corresponding to its natural frequency. 

Fortunately, an investigation using a computational method similar to the one explored in 

the present work showed that the addition of the ZPF to the classical description of the 

oscillator gives rise to a discrete excitation spectrum equal to the one predicted by QM 

[33]. This result suggests that even the quantization seems to be a natural consequence of 

the ZPF addition to the classic mechanics, while in the QM case the quantization seems 

to be an imposed non-intuitive characteristic.  

A very famous classical problem, the Bohr atom stability, was also treated with 

success by SED, whereby the electron according to the Rutherford planetary model would 

absorb energy from the ZPF, which would balance the energy lost by radiation damping, 

known characteristic of an accelerated charge. This mechanism was demonstrated with 

success for the Hydrogen atom ground state [6][7].  

For a better understanding of this physical model (SED), the reader can consult, in 

ref. [6], an extensive paper of Boyer (1975) with the most important SED foundations or, 

for more recent reviews, refs. [34] [40]. 

Along the years, some investigators have abandoned SED since it failed for non-

linear systems [35]. However, others persisted and presently there is still investigation 

being done in this area. The advances in computational simulation represented a new hope 

for the SED development. The numerical integration allows solving the SED equations, 

before hard to solve analytically. Some recent works, as the ones performed by Cole et 

al. for the Hydrogen atom [35][36], and by Huang and Batelaan for the harmonic 



9 

 

oscillator [33][32], have demonstrated the great potential of SED. These classical 

simulations related with the interaction of a planetary-like orbiting electron with radiation 

represent not only a development for SED, but can also have practical implications such 

as the understanding of Rydberg atoms interacting with radiation [35]. Herewith, there is 

the possibility of controlling the chemical and atomic proprieties of the atoms by means 

of irradiation or resonant cavity confinement [36][37].   

A modern version of SED that includes the spin (SEDS) seems to be very promising 

since it solves some of the SED failures such as the non-linear potentials [38]. This 

modification drastically changes the motion equation of electrically charged particles in 

the ordinary SED realm, because the spin addition reaffirms the influence of the special 

relativity. SEDS was also able to derivate the Bohr’s complete condition, including the 

excited states. SEDS can even explain some phenomena presently unexplainable by QED, 

namely:  

1) the physical origin of the ZPF, and its natural upper cut-off;  

2) an anomaly in experimental studies of neutrino rest mass;  

3) the origin and quantitative studies of 1/f noise;  

4) the origin of the high-energy tail of cosmic radiation.  

This success is due to the fact that SEDS (like SED) consider a real ZPF in contrast 

with QED, which makes the ZPF renormalization [38].  

Other variations of SED were suggested in recent investigations with emphasis to 

Rodríguez [28], who demonstrates that SED needs some feedback mechanism for the 

particles to store energy across their random motion in order to maintain their averaged 

equilibrium. It was suggested that the inner structure of the particles could have the 

freedom degrees necessary to store energy from ZPF when it is in excess and to release it 

for the atomic system when it is in defect. This new view of SED could bring new 

advances, as in the angular momentum quantization and in the excited states of the atoms, 

among others [28]. 

2.2. Hydrogen atom according to stochastic electrodynamics 

Since the main goal of our work is to study the influence of the ZPF in atoms and the 

perturbations in their energy levels induced by modifications on ZPF, we start with the 

simplest scenario, the Hydrogen (H) atom.   

As it is known since long time, the classical description of the H atom is not 

consistent with the reality. Any charged particle in an accelerated motion emits Larmor 



10 

 

radiation losing progressively its energy [8]. Then, despite of the Coulomb force that 

maintains the electron in a circular orbit, the Abraham-Lorentz force (product of the 

radiation reaction) makes the electron quickly collapsing in a spiral orbit towards the 

nucleus [35][36], whose decay rate is shown in figure 1.  

 

Figure 1: The electron orbit radius of an H atom as a function of time according to 

the classical theory. Computed with the explicit Runge-Kutta method (ode45 

MATLAB’s internal function with absolute error tolerance 9 × 107). 

 

SED solves this orbital instability problem with the addition of a random 

electromagnetic background even at zero Kelvin, the ZPF [6][7]. This ZPF is the classical 

description of the one predicted by QM.  

The energy lost by the electron in the form of Larmor radiation is by these means 

compensated by the energy absorbed from the ZPF’s electric and magnetic fields [8]. This 

equilibrium is not static but dynamical instead, due to the random character of ZPF, which 

causes the electron orbit to acquire a radius distribution in time instead of a static radius, 

as it will be shown in the next sections. Then, when we refer to stability it is not about a 

fixed orbit but stability over time, which converges to a fixed orbit radius when we 

compute the average over all orbit radii for a time long enough. Some authors claim that 

QM is a static description of property averages but in reality these systems have a frenetic 

random behaviour induced by ZPF [28]. Hence, SED or some SED version could be a 

more fundamental theory of the nature than QM. 

Looking for the SED’s fundamentals, it is reasonable to think that ZPF determines 

the orbit radius distribution of an electron in the atom, and consequently the ground state 

energy level is imposed by the ZPF. It then could be possible to influence the atom 

properties by means of the manipulation of ZPF. 

SED has been successful for linear systems such as the harmonic oscillator and for 

linear fields in Casimir/van der Waals type simulations [6]. However, for non-linear 

systems, the results seem not to converge with the ones generated by QM [35]. It has been 



11 

 

suggested that this discrepancy was due to the difficulties to deal analytically with non-

linear differential equations, and then that non-linear systems (such as the Coulomb 

potential in the H atom) can be successfully solved using numeric simulations [35][36]. 

In this chapter, we review, replicate and comment some of the work done regarding the 

electron motion in the H atom by means of numerical integration, with special focus on 

ref. [35]. 

2.2.1.  Motion of the electron in the H atom according to SED 

In this section we based mostly on the paper of Cole and Zou [35], however other 

important works are complementary to this, as refs. [31][36]. In the present work, we tried 

to replicate the results achieved in ref. [35], related to the electron radius distribution in 

the classic H atom, using the same terminology and similar approximations. We were still 

able to make some simulations for longer times relative to the simulations reported in the 

bibliography. In these simulations, we found for the first time some unexpected orbital 

behaviours, such as extremely elliptic orbits and a continuous tendency of the electron 

orbit to outer radius. This observation may arise some doubts concerning the model or 

even the theory stability. 

In order to simplify the H atom model, we made some approximations. Since the 

proton is much heavier than the electron, we considered the proton mass infinite and the 

H nucleus motionless in the origin of our referential.  We also considered the non-

relativist approximation since the electron speed is much lower than the speed of light 

(approximately two orders of magnitude lower as we will show in the results section). 

Thus, the Newton’s second law of motion is given by equation 2 (in SI units) [35].

In equation (2), ? and ? are respectively the electron charge and mass, ? is the electron 

position vector, ?0 the vacuum permittivity, ? the light speed in vacuum and, finally, ? 

and ? are respectively the electric and magnetic field vectors of the ZPF [35]. The first 

term in the right side of equation (2) is the Coulomb force and the second term is the 

radiation reaction, a force that is characteristic of all accelerated charge systems. Since 

the Coulomb attractive force is the dominating force in the electron orbit, the third order 

derivate of the radiation reaction term can be approximated by equation (3).

In order to complete equation (2), we must define the ZPF electric and magnetic 

fields. However, once again some considerations are required since it is impossible to 

generate numerically the infinite number of modes of the ZPF. For each ZPF mode, a 

wave number was associated, in the form of a vector ? that defines the propagation 

direction of each wave. It is also possible to associate to ? an angular frequency (?) given 

by ? = ?|?|. In the free space all the modes are allowed, thus ZPF takes the integral form 

making the numerical modes generation impossible. However, in a bounded space, such 

as a box of perfectly reflective walls at zero potential, not all the ? modes are allowed 

[35][32]. The bound conditions impose that all the waves have two nodes coincident with 

the walls, thus the wavelengths can only be integers of half the box dimension. Hence we 

can simulate the H atom inside a big cubic box and still have a good approximation to the 

free space. Consequently, the electric part of the ZPF can be described by a plane wave 

expansion, as shown in equation (4), solution of the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations 

in a bounded space [35][32].

In equation (4), ? is the electron position vector and ? the time. Since the waves are 

related with integer multiples of the box dimensions, it was convenient to associate each 

wave to the index ?, so ?? , ??  and ??  take only integer values. The wave number of each 

wave is then given by ?? = 2? (

dimensions [35]. We can also define for future references the box volume by 

? = ??  ?? ??. Each wave frequency can be computed from ?? = ?|??|. According to 

SED, the waves don’t have a preferential polarization, so each wave contains two 

polarization components orthogonal to the propagation direction [35]. The symbol ? 

represents each of these polarizations and consequently we have ?? ? ?????,? = 0 and ?????,? ?

?????,?´ = 0 for ? ? ?´. The constants ???,? and ???,? are real numbers generated randomly 



13 

 

in the beginning of each simulation [35]. The algorithm to generate these random numbers 

was designed so that the numbers are generated according to a Gaussian distribution with 

centroid at zero and second moment equal to ????,?
2 ? = ????,?

 ,which corresponds 

to the spectral distribution of the ZPF, described by the equation (1) [35]. 

Alternatively, we can represent the ZPF in another form, this new representation 

being used in chapter 3. In equation 4 the random character of the ZPF appears in the 

form of random generated amplitudes in two trigonometric functions, however this is 

equivalent to one fixed amplitude trigonometric function with random generated phase 

[6]. And thus we can express ????(?, ?) as in equation 5 [32].

 (5) 

Even being equation (4) a discrete sum of waves, since the index ? takes infinite 

values (positive and negative), to limit the number of waves it is then required to define 

a minimum (????) and maximum (????) frequencies. The minimum frequency may 

correspond to the largest wave allowed in the box and the maximum frequency will 

determine the minimum radius for which the simulation is valid [35].  

The magnetic part of the ZPF is easily generated from the electric part. Thus 

???? (?, ?) is obtained from equation (4) by replacing ?????,? by 
1

?
???? × ?????,? [35]. 

We are now capable of integrating the differential equation (2) and in that way 

tracking the electron in the H atom.  

2.2.2. Approximations and algorithm implementation 

An exact implementation of the method described in the last section would be 

computationally very heavy and the integration of equation (2) would be very slow. Some 

more approximations are then required, as proposed in ref. [35]. The starting point is 

restricting the electron motion to a single plane (?? plane) and then eliminating the 

number of possible waves. Since we forced the electron motion in the ?? plane, we need 

to eliminate the waves which can induce a force in the ? axis6, yet preserving the validity 

of the relevant physical effects. For this we made the box in such a way that the 

                                                 
6 As in simulations, these waves don’t make any difference in the electron motion, they will only waste 

CPU time. 



14 

 

dimensions in the ? and ? axis are so small that there are not any waves travelling in these 

directions, so there are only waves travelling in the direction orthogonal to the plane ??. 

Of course in reality there will always be waves of higher frequencies travelling in these 

directions (? and ?) but these ZPF frequencies are too high to influence an electron whose 

frequency is much lower, so it is not necessary to generate these waves. This 

approximation is just the same as to make ?? and ?? equal to zero in equation (4). 

Consequently, for the simulated radius range, the electron will only interact with the 

waves propagating in the ? direction (positive and negative). And by definition, the 

electric fields ???? (?, ?) of such waves (and the related forces) have components only in 

the ?? plane. The magnetic fields ???? (?, ?) of these waves and the electron speed vector 

have components only in the ?? plane, so the resulting force will only have a component 

in the ? direction, making the interaction of the electron with ???? (?, ?) absent in the 2D 

approximation. Thereby only the electric part of the ZPF remains, enabling a decrease to 

half the number of waves that would be present in the free space. Furthermore, as we 

generate only the waves in the ? direction, we decrease the total number of waves to the 

cubic root. 

Now we define the box size, as in ref. [35], ?? = ?? = 37,4 Å (much longer than the 

Bohr radius ? 0.529 Å ) and ?? = 40 850 000 Å = 0,41 cm.  

As mentioned before, we also need to define ???? and ????. The relation between 

each frequency and each ?? is easily obtained from equation (6). And the relation between 

a radius and its resonant frequency is given by equation (7) that was obtained equalising 

the centripetal and Coulomb forces.

 (7) 

The minimum frequency allowed in the box is the one for which ?? = 1. This ???? 

is also the orbiting frequency of a circular orbit of radius ???? = 1,06 × 10
?7 ?, which 

is the maximum radius the electron can achieve. If this value is exceeded, the simulation 

is not valid; in that case no wave would influence the electron, and it would be the same 

as the inexistence of ZPF. We have chosen ???? = 1 × 10
?11 ?, and therefore???? to 



15 

 

be generated is 5,03 × 1017??1. The box size (??  and ??) was also made in such way 

that ???? of the waves traveling in the plane ?? is 5,04 × 10
17??1, thus for the electron 

radius there are no resonant waves travelling in the plane ??. 

Even after all these approximations, the time required to track the electron, during 

for example 1 × 10?11 ? in a personal computer, could be much longer than 1 month. 

One more important approximation is therefore needed. Since the electron absorbs energy 

mostly from waves in resonance with its orbital frequency, we will use a window of 

frequencies at each iteration of the integration. This window (??) is defined by a 

minimum and a maximum frequencies that are related with a maximum and a minimum 

radius, respectively. As suggested by Cole et al. in ref. [35], ?? should include all the 

waves between two frequencies, which correspond to the two radius, ?? = ? ? 0,03? and 

?+ = ? + 0,03?, where ? is the instantaneous radius at each iteration. This window is not 

static, instead it changes its width and centroid as the electron is closer or further away 

from the nucleus. The aim is to compute in each integration the resulting force of all the 

waves near the electron resonance frequency since the other waves wouldn’t have a 

significant influence in the electron motion. 

2.2.3. Results of the simulations 

We ran our code (implemented in MATLAB) in three personal computers. We made 

several simulations during several months. It was interesting to notice that some 

simulations were taking much longer times than others. The reason is the difference in 

time that the algorithm takes to integrate small and large orbits, the last ones being quickly 

integrated.  

The initial conditions of the electron were the Bohr radius (~5.3 × 10?11 ?) and the 

correspondent velocity (~2.2 × 106 ?/?). 

The approximations taken are the same as explained in the last section, except that 

we generated only waves travelling in the positive direction. However, due to the random 

character of the waves’ amplitude, we expect similar results. We then integrated the 

electron motion for 32 independent atoms, each one for a unique ZPF generated at the 

beginning of each run.  

The outputs of each run are the electron position and velocity (saved in time intervals 

of 6 × 10?17 ?) as a function of time. From this information, in order to visualize the 

“electronic cloud”, we can plot all the positions that the electron took. We can also plot 



16 

 

the orbit radius as a function of time or the absolute frequency histogram of the electron 

radius. As example, the electron radius as a function of time is plotted in figure 2, where 

we can see a stochastic variation of the electron radius. 

As an attempt to replicate the results of Cole and Zou [35], we made for each 

simulation a frequency histogram and then we summed all the histograms to accumulate 

statistic. The resulting histogram is the orbit radius distribution of the electron according 

to SED. We didn’t take into account the first 5 × 10?13 seconds to reduce the initial 

conditions influence in the histogram. To visualise the histogram variation with the 

amount of statistics accumulated, we plotted four histograms computed for increasing 

times, the results being shown in figure 3. We denote by ???? the amount of entries in 

each histogram, the sum of all the absolute frequencies (the curve integral). To compare 

the electron orbit radius distribution in the SED framework with the correspondent QM 

prediction, we also plotted the radial density curve ?(?), from the Schrodinger’s wave 

equation for the ground state of the H atom. This last curve was normalised to the 

histogram in such a way that the areas under the two curves are the same. ?(?) is given 

(in CGS units) by equation (8):

where ?? =

, and A is the normalization constant [35].

17 

 

As we can see from the figure 3, the radius distribution computed by our algorithm 

seems to converge to the QM prediction, and this notable remark was first observed by 

Cole and Zou [35]. This result validates our algorithm and thus we can use the code for 

other proposes, such as simulations with other initial conditions, research for excited 

states or even adapt it for multi-electron models as the He atom. 

After this test, we performed additional tests with the same model for an atom inside 

a smaller cavity. We started to decrease only ??, however since ?? and ?? are already too 

small the increment of the normalization constant in equation (4), which depends on the 

box dimensions, gives higher amplitudes to the waves. These very intense waves induced 

colossal variations in the electron orbit radius, always kicking it for growing elliptic 

orbits. We still tried to manipulate ?? and ?? to decrease the wave amplitudes, yet it 

resulted again in strong resonant effects (now of lower amplitude), where the electron 

could maintain an immutable elliptic orbit for a long time without significant random 

fluctuations. We suspect these results are due to the large spacing between adjacent 

frequencies (characteristic of the small box) in addition to the fact that, for this one-

dimensional ZPF, there are few waves of similar frequencies. Using a full three-

dimensional ZPF, the number of waves is cubed, yielding much more waves of similar 

frequencies even for a small box. Anyway, the one-dimensional ZPF doesn’t seem to us 

a credible approximation, as we will explain better in the beginning of the next chapter.  

Fortunately we had access to a computer cluster and during this time we tried to 

evaluate the model stability. According to SED, the electron orbit should be stable, so if 

the model is stable the electron orbit radius should not have a tendentious behaviour along 

time, but instead it would always have a random motion without colliding against the 

nucleus or ionize, whatever the simulation time. In addition to this, for a long enough 

time, the radius distribution of a single simulation should be similar to the Schrodinger 

equation prediction, without the need of accumulating statistics from other simulations. 

We run the previous 2D-algorithm (this time implemented in C++) for longer times, 

generating waves travelling in positive and negative directions. We made a set of 16 

simulations up to 10?9 ?. Some of them didn’t reach the end time because the electron 

crossed the radius limits (???? and ????), forcing the simulation to stop. To validate the 

implementation of this algorithm in C++, we computed the radius distribution (of the 16 

simulations summed up) accounting for shorter times only. The solution seems also to 

converge with the QM prediction, as shown in figure 4. However, for longer times the 

result seems to deviate from the QM prediction, as shown in figure 5. From the various 

plots we often see a tendentious motion, either to outer orbits or to the nucleus direction. 

However, we don’t know what would happen for radius shorter than ???? = 10
?11 ?, 

maybe the electron can collide with the nucleus, or can return to outer orbits, thus keeping 

the atomic stability. Thus, the growth towards outer orbits for longer times (figure 5) is 

in part due to the stopped simulations, remaining only the simulations that never reached 

the minimum radius. This aspect can be improved in the future by decreasing the 

minimum radius, however there will always be a computational limitation. For example, 

if we decrease by half the actual minimum radius, the number of ZPF generated modes 

will be doubled. In addition, in some cases we also observe a continuous tendency 

towards outer orbits with extremely elliptic behaviours, an effect shown, for example, in 

figure 6.

Despite the notarial tendentious behaviour in some cases, no simulation alone was 

able to reproduce a radius distribution similar to the one predicted by QM. Thus, we can 

conclude that, for longer times, either this method is not stable or the approximations used 

are not suitable, or still SED is incomplete.

3. Three-dimensional ZPF  

Although it was used in the past, the one-dimensional representation of ZPF is not 

realistic. Even if we consider a parallelepiped box as Cole and Zou [35], where one 

dimension is much bigger than the others, it’s not a good approximation of the free space. 

To evaluate this affirmation we can consider the model described by Cole and Zou, 

explained in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 [35]. If we make Lx and Ly small enough to suppress 

all the waves in resonance7 with the electron radius down to 10?11 ?, the only ones that 

contribute to the radius fluctuations are the waves propagating in the z direction. Then we 

can make Lz big enough to consider the H atom in free space. However, the normalization 

factor (
1

???×??×??
) in equation (4) depends not only on the Lz dimension but also on Ly 

and Lx, so the box size (Lz, Lx and Ly) dictates the waves’ amplitude. Consequently, 

although we fix Lz, which preserves the number of modes inside the box, by changing Lx 

and/or Ly the resulting electron behaviour induced by the ZPF will be different, since the 

normalization factor influences the waves’ amplitude. In conclusion, if the purpose is to 

simulate the free space, a model that gives us different results to the same problem cannot 

be fully right.  

An alternative is to use a cubic cavity with the three dimensions large enough to 

consider the atom in free space. Thus k is distributed uniformly in a cubic mesh. This 

method is nothing more than the direct application of equation (4). However, as Cole et 

al. noticed, it can be computationally very hard. As the number of waves present in the 

box is raised to the cube, while in the previous method we dealt with approximately 106 

elements in a matrix, now in a cubic box there will be 1018 elements in a matrix. 

In this chapter, we treat the ZPF in a cubic box, meaning that the propagation vector 

of the waves will have three-dimensional components. We started with a method, which 

will be called “Spherical Method”, to generate a 3D ZPF. In the annexe 8.1 we refer two 

works that introduced this method. There, we also implement some of these ideas using 

MATLAB and replicate with success some effects. In section 3.1, we develop our own 

method, the Perfect Box Method, and an algorithm that better satisfies the requirements 

of this work. Aiming to make a preliminary estimation of the shift of the averaged radius 

                                                 
7 The term “waves in resonance” is used for the waves whose frequency is close to the electron angular 

frequency. 



22 

 

of the bounded H atom, we start by resuming what is relevant in the literature and, in 

section 3.2, we perform some calculations for the H atom in free space. In section 3.4, we 

introduce the perturbations induced in the averaged radius of the H atom when ZPF is 

modified. Finally, in sections 3.4 and 3.5, we try to compute the shift on the equilibrium 

radius of the H atom induced by a ZPF modification, using the Spherical Method and the 

Perfect Box Method. 

The reader should take in account that in this chapter, up to section 3.6, we only deal 

with the electric field. However, for future works, the magnetic part of the ZPF can be 

easily obtained (as explained in the previous chapter) from the electric part of the ZPF. 

3.1. Perfect box method 

As discussed in annex 8.1, the spherical method can be unreliable when used in small 

boxes where the density of k-vectors in the k-space is too low (corresponding to a small 

number of waves N), a situation for which the spherical method does not work so well 

also, since it does not preserve real geometrical k-vector characteristics. Therefore, we 

need to find a more realistic description of ZPF to simulate the effects of bounded ZPF, 

the main purpose of this work. The simplest, realistic and computational achievable form 

of representing the waves inside a cubic box is to generate a set of k-vectors in a perfect 

cubic mesh between a maximum and minimum frequencies. This method is also 

important to generate a trusty ZPF for future simulations where accuracy is the main 

requirement, as it is in our case. 

Since we have not found in the literature an algorithm to generate such ZPF, we 

developed one and implemented it in MATLAB. This algorithmic is described in the 

following paragraphs.  

First, a set of points is generated, each point described by three coordinates, 

represented by a matrix of integers. These points correspond to a perfect cubic mesh in a 

Cartesian space. The maximum possible integer (???? ) generated is computed from the 

maximum frequency, which is related with the defined maximum radius of the electron 

orbit, according to equation (9).

After that, an iterative algorithm removes the points whose frequency is greater than 

???? or lower than ????. The iterative algorithm also creates new points between the 



23 

 

original points, increasing the number of points in the matrix by a factor of 8 in each 

iteration and always eliminating the points outside the frequency window. We have made 

this iterative method because it was computationally too heavy to create all the points in 

the beginning (since the quantity would be huge) and then cut out the ones outside ??. 

Therefore, we refine the mesh iteratively cutting always the edges (i.e. the points outside 

??) at each iteration. The result is a 3D spherical layer of integer points (each one 

described by 3 coordinates) whose width is proportional to the difference between the 

maximum and minimum frequencies. As an example, a slice on the plane ? = 0 of these 

points (integer version of ?-vectors) is plotted in figure 7, where the cubic disposition of 

the points is perceptible. 

This spherical layer of integer points is saved together with 2 more random numbers 

associated to each point, completing all we need to describe the ZPF according to our 

approximations. Each of these random numbers was generated uniformly between 0 and 

2?. They will constitute the random phase for each polarization of the wave described by 

each ?-vector. Finally the correct ?-vector matrix is obtained from the multiplication of 

the integer points saved by the space between adjacent ?-vectors (??), which in turn is 

related with the box volume and described by equation (10).

minimum frequency, were taken out. This sample was generated for the Bohr radius, for a box 

of side (?) equal to 400 ?m.

It’s important to note the difficulties of a trusty generation of the ZPF in free space. 

For example, the number of ?-vectors generated for a cubic box of ? = 400 ?? for all 

the frequencies resonating with the radius between ???? = 10
?11 ? and ???? = 1,06 ×

10?5 ? (the dimensions used by Cole et al. in Ref. [35]) is about 9×1018. Accounting the 

two polarizations of the electric fields, this matrix will be doubled. As we can see, for a 

personal computer, a matrix with such number of elements is impossible to save in the 

RAM memory. The solution we found was to create and save the ZPF (the ?-vectors and 

the random numbers) into data files for different intervals of ??. Thus, when we make 

the simulation of the electron motion (or other kind of simulation) we load into RAM 

memory the corresponding ZPF file that contains the waves resonating with the present 

orbit radius of the electron. This operation of constant opening and closing the files and 

writing to RAM memory will make the simulation time much longer.  

3.2. Equilibrium radius evaluation in the free space 

Boyer [6] and other authors [7] have suggested that the atomic stability (as the 

harmonic oscillator stability) is the result of the equilibrium between the power absorbed 

and the power radiated by the electrons. Let us consider the simple case of a one-

dimensional harmonic oscillator of natural frequency ?0 immersed in the ZPF, located in 

the origin and with its motion in the x axis. In these conditions, the motion equation is 

given by equation (11), where we use the non-relativistic Newton motion law for all the 

forces applied in the oscillating charge [7].

??? (0, ?) (11) 

As we are considering an oscillating electron, the constants e and m are respectively the 

electron charge and mass. ??
??? (0, ?) is the ? component of the ZPF electric part in the 

referential origin. The first term in the right side of equation (10) is the restoring force 

characteristic of the harmonic oscillator, the third term is the force induced by the ZPF 

spectrum, and the second term is the self-reaction term, where the constant ? is related to 

the radiation damping. This characteristic damping of an accelerated charge is created by 

the Abraham–Lorentz force. In SI units, ? takes the form shown in equation 12 [7],

where ?0 is the permittivity of the vacuum and ? the speed of light in vacuum.

predominant, we can simplify the self-reaction term, resulting equation (13).

With equation (13) and the ZPF spectrum distribution described by equations (4) or

the ZPF by the electron, as shown in equation (14) [7].

Now, for the H atom system, we can consider the Bohr model, in which the ground 

state is described by a circular orbit of radius ?0, as two one-dimensional harmonic 

oscillators in quadrature. Taking this argument into account, the quantity in equation (14) 

will be doubled in the case of a circular orbit. As a result, according to our approximation 

to the circular orbit, the power absorbed will be twice the power absorbed by a single 

harmonic oscillator [7].  

Considering circular orbits, since a Coulomb central force is applied to an electron 

by a point size proton whose mass is considered infinite, the radius of the circular orbits 

is related with its angular frequency by the equation (14)8.

Substituting ?0 from equation (15) in equation (14), we obtain equation (16), which gives 

us the average power absorbed as function of the electron radius.

26 

 

To deduce the average radiated power as function of the electron radius for the H 

atom, we start by calculating the power radiated by an electron with acceleration A in a 

circular orbit. It is given by equation (17) [7].

It is perceptible that the average powers absorbed and radiated by the electron have 

different dependences on the electron radius. As we can see from the plot of figure 8, the 

power absorbed is predominant for smaller radius, while for bigger radius the radiated 

power is predominant. This behaviour suggests the existence of an equilibrium radius, 

since for shorter radius the electron absorbs more energy from the ZPF than the one it 

radiates, leading to bigger orbits, and for larger radius the radiated energy is greater 

making it to decay to smaller orbits. According to this hypothesis, the average radius will 

be obtained by equalling equations (16) and (18) or by the intersection of the two curves 

(power radiated and absorbed), as represented in figure 8. For the free space 

approximation, this intersection yields exactly the Bohr radius (??) [7]. 

 

Figure 8: Plot of ????  and ???? computed from equations (16) and (18) for radius between 

4.8 × 10?11 ? and 6.8 × 10?11 ?. The interception of the two curves is exactly ?? . 

 



27 

 

We have considered the power radiated by an electron in a circular orbit as 

independent on ZPF, at least when described by equation (18). On the other hand, 

according with our approximations, ZPF plays a crucial rule in the absorbed power. In 

this work, we are considering the hypothesis that the atom stability is due to the 

equilibrium between ????  and ????. Then, as ???? depends on ZPF, it is reasonable to 

assume that a different ZPF could result in a different equilibrium state that can change 

the energies of the ground and excited states of the atomic systems. It’s now clear the 

need to study ???? when ZPF is changed as in the case of a cubic box of perfect metallic 

neutral walls. To the best of our knowledge, such study is absent in the literature. 

3.3. Equilibrium radius evaluation in a reflective box 

Equation (14) was deduced for the free space where the frequency spectrum is 

continuum, while in a box the frequencies take discrete values. From refs. [7] and [40], it 

is possible to deduce in SI units ????? ????? for a discrete ZPF spectrum, as seen in equation 

(19).

In equation (18), a sum is made over all waves associated to the ?-vectors and to 

frequencies ?. As seen before in section 2.2.1, equations (4) and (5), the amplitude of 

each wave for the bonded space, as considered here, is well described by equation (20), 

where ? is the volume inside the box.. 

 

?(?) = ?

?0?
 (20) 

Since infinite multiples of the fundamental frequency are admitted in the box, even 

inside a small box ZPF will have infinite modes making the computation impossible. 

However, the electron in the circular orbit will absorb energy mostly from the resonance 

modes. Therefore, if we select a window of modes whose frequencies (?) are close to the 

natural frequency (?0), we should have a good approximation of ?
???. To define this 

window, we must evaluate the integral of the continuum ZPF in free space for different 

frequency limits.  



28 

 

In ref. [7], before the final solution shown in equation (14), an intermediate solution 

was deduced, equation (21), which takes into account the integral over all the continuum 

frequency distribution of ZPF.

The driven damped harmonic oscillator in the approximation of small damping 

(??0
2 ? ?0), such as in this case

9, has a strong resonating behaviour. The FWHM (Full 

Width at Half Maximum) of the resonance curve (amplitude as a function of the driven 

frequency) is proportional to ??0
2. Then we can define a window (??) between a 

minimum and a maximum frequencies that will contain the most significant ZPF waves 

that can influence the electron motion. This window must be proportional to the resonance 

curve FWHM, and thus it will be dynamic since it will change with ?0 and so with ?0.  

Before computing ???? by the electron of the H atom inside a box, we need to define 

?? large enough to allow a good approximation. Since in a driven damped harmonic 

oscillator, as the one we are using, described by equation (13), the damping constant 

(??0
2) is proportional to the resonance curve FWHM, we also made ?? proportional to 

??0
2 [32][1]. Taking as a reference the Bohr radius, ???? is calculated using equation 

(21) for different ?? values, being ?? = f ??0
2, where f is an integer proportionality 

constant [32]. In figure 9, we can see the resonance curve of ???? as a function of ?, 

according to equation (21).

corresponds to ? between 4.134131 × 1016 ???/?and 4.134152 × 1016 ???/?. 

 

 



29 

 

As we can see from figure 10, as large the window is, the smaller is the deviation in 

????. So as further away from the resonant frequency are the wave frequencies, less 

significant is their influence in the electron. Therefore, we only need to consider ?? large 

enough to have a small error. For example, with 400 times the quantity ??0
2 (f = 400), 

we have a deviation between the computed and the theoretical values of only 0.16%, 

which is almost negligible. 

The method proposed by us to compute the equilibrium radius (???) in a box of 

reflective walls (considering ????  independent from the boundary conditions) starts with 

the generation of a set of radius between two limits where we suppose to exist ???. Then 

we compute the total absorbed power for each radius using equation (19), where the k-

values and the correspondent ? values are from all the waves present in a box in all 

possible directions whose frequency is between the limits defined by ??. The result is a 

curve of ???? as a function of the radius similar the one generated by equation (14). Since 

we are considering that ????  is independent from the box dimensions, the curve for the 

power radiated by the electron is the same as in the free space, described by equation (17). 

So the radius for which ???? inside the box equals ????  is ???.

and computed from equation (14) (???? =  4.669311 × 10?8 W/s), in red, and the relative

trapezoidal method with 107 steps.

3.4. Equilibrium radius inside a box using the spherical method 

As described in annex 8.1, the Spherical Method enables an easy computational 

construction of the ZPF [32]. This approximation is however valid only for a large number 

of waves, and consequently a great density of waves in the k-space. But when we decrease 

the box volume (V), the density of waves in k-space (??) also decreases, since ?? is related 

to the volume by ?? = ?/(2?)
3 [32]. Moreover, in the spherical method there is only one 

wave for each frequency. Then, for the same V and consecutively the same ??, there is a 

small spacing between adjacent frequencies when compared to the cubic box method 

described before. This effect can be easily evaluated by comparison of figures (11) and 

(12) 

In figure 11 we can see a plot of several ???? distributions of several k modes for a 

specific ?? and for the Bohr radius. To compute the total ???? for this specific radius, 

we only need to sum all the points according to equation (19). We notice that the random 

character of the spherical method10 results in a fluctuation of ????, so to compute ???? 

for each radius we make the average of a set of computations for the same conditions and 

radius.  

The goal is to compute the variation of ???? with the radius in order to find the radius 

for which ???? equals ???? , so first we need to compute ????  for a set of radius using 

equation (19). Then we can make a fit of these points in order to search for the interception 

of the fitting curve and the ????  theoretical curve. The fitting function should be similar 

                                                 
10 Each k wave is generated with a random direction that in the limit of an infinite number of waves 

generated yields an isotropic distribution of the waves direction.

to the theoretical function, equation (16), but should allow also some freedom in the 

fitting. Therefore, we chose for fitting equation 22, 

 ???? =  ???  (22) 

where ? is the independent variable and ? and ? the fitting freedom parameters. In the 

limit of ? ? ? these parameters should take the values ? = ?4.5 and ? =
  ?5 ?

=

  2.663522 × 10?54 (both in SI units), according to equation (16). 

However, the fitting method (also used in the perfect box method) is subject of some 

discussion because the points from which we make the fit don’t have a statistical 

behaviour, they are exactly the power absorbed by the electron in a circular orbit with a 

specific radius. We know that the smaller the box is, the sparser will be the frequencies 

of the ZPF. In the case of very small boxes, this effect results in some radius for which 

the electron doesn’t absorb energy and in other radius for which the absorbed energy is 

colossal (an example of these differences of the box-???? for adjacent radius are shown 

in figure 14), resulting in violent fluctuation in the box-???? curve that is no more the 

smooth curve of figure 8. Therefore, there are a lot of interceptions of this box-???? curve 

and the curve of ????  in free space. In other words, there are multiple ??? very close to 

each other. However, the force induced on the electron by the random ZPF makes it 

traveling distances larger than the interval between adjacent equilibrium radius. So, we 

intuitively expect that in this random motion the box-???? (the one which have violent 

fluctuations) will contribute with an average component to the net motion of the electron 

for longer time scales, being the presence of this multi-??? masked. Thus we can compute 

an average curve (this one will already be smooth) by fitting some points of the box-???? 

and search the intersection (which correspond to an averaged unique ???) of this average 

curve with the ????  in free space.  

The fitting method for equation (22) is the non-linear least squares. In some cases, 

mainly for smaller boxes, there will be points extremely high (for which a resonance wave 

coincides with the radius), so a robust fitting could be more adequate, like the LAR fit 

that will minimize the least absolute residuals.  

The effect of the ???? fluctuations for adjacent radius could have some periodicity 

and the choice of the set of radius could compromise our understanding of the phenomena. 

Therefore, to look for this ???? variation as an average behaviour, the radius should be 



32 

 

chosen randomly in the interest interval. The number of random radius will be denoted 

by rs and the number of generated waves by N. As explained in annex 8.1, for the 

spherical method the number of waves and the maximum and minimum frequencies allow 

us to compute an estimate of the box volume and, consequently, of the box side (denoted 

by L) [32].  

The spherical method has success to estimate the free space ??? (equal to the Bohr 

radius), however for a small cavity the results are questionable. These results and its 

discussion are presented in annex 8.2. 

 

 

3.5. Equilibrium radius inside a box using the Perfect Box Method 

Since the previous method seems to be not reliable, we repeated the same simulations 

using the Perfect Box Method. This new method has two major advantages: no need of 

multiple computations of ???? for the same radius since the method doesn’t have a 

random character in the direction of k-vectors, opposite to the spherical method, and no 

need of estimating the box dimensions from the frequency window and number of waves 

since in this new method the box dimension is an input parameter defined a priori.  

For big boxes, even between close values of ???? and ????, the number of k-vectors 

generated for each radius is colossal, so it is necessary to compute and save different files 

with different sets of k-vectors. Then the algorithm that computes ???? for each radius 

iteratively opens the saved files containing the different sets of k-vectors, computing the 

sum of equation (19) for each file and adding always the previous value so that in the end 

???? is obtained for that specific radius.  

Once again, the frequencies generated for each radius are discrete, however 

differently from the Spherical Method for the same conditions. In the Spherical Method, 

each k-vector has a distinct frequency, however in a cubic box there are a lot of k-vectors 

with the same frequency11. This feature is shown in figure 12, where the box size is larger 

than the one used with the Spherical Method (figure 11) and even then, the discreetness 

is bigger than in the Spherical Method.  

                                                 
11 Since ? = ?|?| and, in a cubic 3D mesh in the Cartesian space, there are a lot of points (?-vectors) 
equidistant from the origin. 



33 

 

Once again the sum of ???? is computed, using equation (19), for each radius as 

described in annex 8.2. Here we apply the Spherical Method. We also use the fitting 

method of equation (22) in the same way as described in section 3.4. The terminology 

defined before in the Spherical Method has the same meaning.  

???? was computed by this new method for the Bohr radius, using f = 400 and ? =

9 × 10?5 ?, where we obtained ???? = 4.663982 × 10?8 ?/?, very similar to the 

analytic value (4.669311 × 10?8 ?/?) obtained from equation (21). This gives us some 

positive feedback about the reliability of this method.  

Now we can estimate ??? for a big box (free space approximation). The power 

absorbed for a set of random radius chosen between 4,97 × 10?11 and 5,82 × 10?11 ? 

is shown in figure 13. 

 

Figure 12: Power absorbed ???? for each wave in a box, for the Bohr radius and for f =

100, which corresponds to ???? = 4.13408828 × 10
16 ???/? and ???? = 4.13419538 ×

1016 ???/?. The box size is ? = 4 × 10?5 ?.  



34 

 

As we can see from figure 13, there is an agreement between the computed ???? and 

the theoretical curves. The value of ??? was estimated by the interception between the 

fitted curve (robust LAR method) and ???? in free space, yielding ??? = 5.282 × 10
?11, 

very close to the Bohr radius ?? (that plot and calculus are not shown in this document). 

We can then conclude that the algorithm and the code are functional and provide accurate 

results, at least for the free space approximation. This validation is important for future 

simulations where a trusty generation of ZPF is required. 

We computed the fitting curve of ???? for smaller boxes. In figure 14 we can see an 

example of ???? as a function of the radius for a small box, together with the theoretical 

free space curve.  

From figure 14 we can observe that, opposite to the Spherical Method, no splitting 

behaviour is visible (as shown in annex 8.2). This suggests that the Perfect Box method 

is more reliable for small boxes. It is also shown in figure 14 the expected pronounced 

scattering. This accentuated difference between ???? for neighbouring radii is originated 

by the discreteness of ?. As smaller the box used is, the bigger will be the differences on 

???? for neighbouring radii.

The computation of ???? was performed for a big box with rs = 10, f = 400 and ? = 8 ×

10?4 ?. 



35 

 

Once the fiting of the computed data is made, we can find the intersection between ????  

and the  ???? fitted curve, as in figure 6. The intersection is our estimation of ???. As 

expected, the ??? for the Hydrogen atom in a small box (at least according with our 

approximation) is smaller than the value in the free space (??).

= 400, f = 400 and ? = 5 × 10?5 ?. The ??? was found to be 4,265 × 10
?11?. 

 

We made some computations as in the previous example (where we used ? = 5 ×

10?5 ?) but for different box sizes. The results are presented in figure 16. We made fits 

using the robust LAR method and a non-robust method, however for smaller boxes (L ?

10?3 ?) the non-robust method often produced an extremely low ?2, and sometimes the

36 

 

solution did not converge. Thereby we prefer not to pay much attention to the results of 

the non-robust fit. Still in figure 16 we present both fitting methods for each ? value used. 

Note that there are points from the robust method in figure 16 that don’t have 

correspondent result from the non-robust method, for such  L values the fitting curve 

doesn’t intercept the ????  curve. The reason for this failure may be due to the poor fitting 

quality of the non-robust method, or the interception point could be outside of the radius 

window used to generate the computed ???? points. 

 

As we initially suggested, the H atom  equilibrium radius seems to decrease as we 

suppress more and more ZPF modes, at least if we consider (as we did) that, in a Casmir 

cavity, the radiated power is not changed and the atom radiates as in free space. 

3.5.1. Number of absorbed modes 

As the radius of the electron in the H atom decreases, its angular frequency increases, 

as from equation (15). So the damping constant (??0
2) in equation (13) is larger for 

smaller radius, resulting in a broadening of the resonance curve (figure 9) since the 

FWHM of a resonance curve of this type is proportional to the damping constant. Thus, 

according to our approximations, an atom will absorb much more energy from the ZPF 

modes for smaller electron radius. As an example, we computed the number of modes 

(????? ) transferring energy to the electron in a specific frequency range  (? = 100) for 

a box with ? = 4 × 10?5 ?, for two different radii, the Bohr radius (??) and 1.2 ??, 

resulting respectively in ????? = 76680 and ????? = 22276. In conclusion, as smaller

and blue circles represent ??? computed using the robust method and the non-robust method 

fittings, respectively. Some computations with the non-robust fitting didn’t produce a result, 

thus some red squares don’t have the corresponding blue circle. 



37 

 

the electron radius is, the larger will be the number of different ZPF modes transferring 

energy to the electron. 

Now we can evaluate how ?????  changes with the box size. We made the same 

calculations for two boxes sizes, ? = 4 × 10?5 ? and ? =  3 × 10?5 ?. As expected, 

?????  decreases from the bigger box to the smaller one (since the small box has fewer 

modes), either for the small orbit or for the larger orbit. However, for ? = 1,2 × ?? the 

decrease in ?????  was 64 %, while for ? = ?? the decrease was 57 %. This allows us to 

conclude that a difference in the box size induces a larger perturbation to larger radius 

orbits than to smaller radius orbits. So, inside a cavity, larger shifts are expected for higher 

principal quantum number (n), considering the H atom described by the Bohr model. 

3.5.2. An energetic evaluation 

As we are working in the realm of classic mechanics, we will evaluate the energy 

from that point of view. To compute the energy of the ground state in free space of the 

Hydrogen atom, we use simple mechanics such as the Newton’s second law, to describe 

the electron motion. Thus, the centripetal force (?? ) acting in the electron is given by 

equation (23) [39].

Finally, knowing the potential energy (U) of the electron in the Coulomb potential, 

we can sum the electron kinetic and potential energies and compute the total energy (E) 

for the Bohr radius, given by equation (25) [39].

Assuming that equation (25) is applicable to a H atom in a reflective box, we

and in a reflective box. As an example, we will use ??? obtained for a box with ? = 5 ×

10?5 ?, as the one of figure 6. For this radius value, the ground state energy is 

?14.4584 ??, and the expected shift relative to the free space is 0.86 ??. 

We conclude that there is an energy shift in the ground state of the H atom when it is 

inside a cubic box of perfectly reflective walls. However, this attempt to estimate the shift 



38 

 

of ??? for the H atom inside a cavity was made according with some important 

considerations, from which we highlight: 

? The H atom is described by two harmonic oscillators in quadrature only valid 

for circular orbits. 

? The radiated power rate is not affected by the boundary conditions imposed 

by the Casimir cavity. 

? It is valid to use a robust fitting of equation (22) in the computed ???? to 

predict the average ???? of an electron in a random motion induced by the 

ZPF. 

3.6. Three-dimensional electron motion in the H atom  

As an attempt to improve our previous work and the works performed by others 

[35][36], we developed a full three-dimensional model of the H atom in the SED 

framework. We implemented here the basic ideas and algorithm used in the previous 

simulations, described in section 2.2, and included some modifications discussed below. 

According to our model, the electron can move in all directions, with no fixed plane 

restriction. The ZPF in our model is also fully generated in 3D, the k-vectors being 

distributed in a perfect cubic mesh according to the SED requirements in the case of a 

cubic cavity. This ZPF can be generated using the perfect box method described in section 

3.1. Other innovation of this model is the inclusion of the magnetic part of the ZPF and 

its influence in the electron orbit, which may cause new features never seen before.  

Besides that, this new model has a smaller number of approximations than the 

methods previously described.  Still, we had to make some approximations. For example, 

the computational impossibility of generating an infinite number of waves forced us to 

generated only the waves resonating with all the radii between two limits, ???? and ????. 

Since we are running the code in a personal computer, which limits the computation time, 

we were forced to use again a window approximation. The frequency window (??) was 

however differently computed in comparison with the previous work. At this time, we 

made ?? = ???0
2, where ? is the proportionality constant and ?0 is the electron 

instantaneous angular frequency computed from its radius for a circular orbit, as from 

equation (15). ? is the same damping constant used in the harmonic damping oscillator 

described in section 3.2 by equation (12). ?? here defined, contrarily to ?? defined in 

2.2.2, preserves the real resonance behaviour of the energy absorbed by the electron from 



39 

 

the ZPF. ?? was calculated assuming only circular orbits, however we also deduced ?? 

based in the real damping constant of the differential equation (2). Nevertheless, our tests 

demonstrated that the difference in ?? was minimal, so we maintain the circular orbit 

approximation for the ?? computation. An example of a 3D plot of the electron position 

variation with time is shown in figure 17. 

Although this method is more realistic, it is also computationally heavier. For big 

cavities, the code was almost impossible to run (in a personal computer) since the number 

of ZPF waves is huge. For small boxes (? below a few microns), the code was possible 

to run according with our computational limitations, however taking a lot of time.  

Our goal was first to have a coherent result (the electron radius distribution for the H 

atom similar to the one predicted by the Schrodinger equation) for the free space, 

validating this code. Next, we would like to compute the electron radius distribution 

inside cavities and estimate the ground state shift for different cavities. However, the

enormous computational resources required by our model made impossible to run the 

code for the free space, and also impossible to accumulate enough statistics. Even so, our 

8 simulations in small cavities have in common the tendency for the electron to be at a 

radius shorter than the Bohr radius for most of the simulation time. This seems to suggest 

that there is a shift induced by the small cavity.  

In a time scale in the order of 10?12?,  we observed only a small deviation from the 

electron initial orbit plane. However, we believe that for longer time scales the position 

distribution would be aspheric like in the QM case. 

We also evaluated the influence of the chosen ?? in the electron behaviour. For this 

purpose, we used our model for three different frequency windows ??. The 

corresponding plots of the electron radius as a function of time are shown in figure 18.  

As we can see, ?? seems to play an important role since the fluctuation amplitude in 

the radius seems to increase as ? is increased. Even ?? being thousands of times greater 

than the FWHM of the absorbed power resonance curve, the waves beyond the electron 

resonance frequency seem to have an important influence on the electron behaviour. This 

observation made us rethink the ?? utilization. We demonstrated (in section 3.3) that the 

waves with frequencies away from the resonance frequency do not have a significant 

influence on the total power absorbed by the electron, at least for the classic harmonic 

oscillator. However, with this new approach, we suggest not using the window 

approximation in the future or using a wider window. Yet, it is possible that this strong 

influence of ?? is only present for small cavities. This hypothesis arises from the fact 

that, in small cavities, the density of ZPF modes is lower, so near the resonance frequency

there are only a few modes, whose influence is too small so that the influence of the 

farther modes begins to be more important. 

3.7. Concluding remarks 

In the present work we don’t consider the influence of the cavity on the atom radiated 

power. However, it is possible that the reflective walls of the cavity will reflect the emitted 

waves which may interfere with their self and also with the orbiting electron. The 

simulations we have made so far are valid for systems immersed in a modified ZPF. 

However, they may not be valid for a cavity since we don’t take into account the 

perturbations in the radiation emitted that is induced by the cavity. The paper of ref. [37] 

studied the spontaneous emission of the harmonic oscillator inside cavities in the SED 

realm. The paper suggests that the radiation damping term, ??0
2 in equation (13), is 

affected by the reflective cavity walls. This conclusion was deduced for a harmonic 

oscillator inside two parallel conductor plates resulting in two modified damping 

constants, one for the perpendicular orientation between the oscillator and the plates and 

the other for the parallel orientation. It was also suggested that, taking into account the 

modifications induced in the damping term and in the ZPF, the ground state harmonic 

oscillator between two mirrors would preserve its free-space energy. However, excited 

states would acquire different cavity-induced properties. It is even affirmed: “If the atom 

stays for a long time inside the cavity some states are "eliminated" because they become 

more unstable, while other states acquire the status of "stable states".”. This supports our 

hypothesis (better explained in the following chapter) of radiative shifts between the 

ground and modified exited states. 

Both methods used by us (discussed in sections 2.2 and 3.6), in addition to not taking 

into account the waves reflected back from the cavity walls, have shown some instability 

problems, mainly the ones discussed in section 2.2.3. Therefore, as suggested in 2.2.3, 

something else could be necessary to achieve the atom stability, for example to account 

for the inner structure of the particles as suggested in ref. [28]. This inner structure will 

allow storing energy in the freedom degrees of this subatomic structure. The stored energy 

is dynamically exchanged between the electron and the inner structure, leading to a feed-

back mechanism capable of maintaining the atomic stability. We are also working in 

collaboration with Rodríguez (author of ref. [28]) to adapt our algorithm in order to 

accomplish this substructure. However no relevant results were achieved so far.

4. Method to extract energy from ZPF 

At this stage the reader could still be a little sceptical about the idea of extracting 

energy from the vacuum. “If the vacuum is the lower state found in the universe how is it 

possible to extract energy from it?” However, as the reader should already understand, 

the vacuum is not all the same, and it’s possible to create a region in the space where the 

vacuum energy is lower than in the free space. This region could be a Casimir cavity, 

where some electromagnetic modes are vanished. From general physics it is known that, 

in order to have an energy flow, there must be an unbalance between two regions, and 

thus the energy can flow from the most to the least energetic region. Even so, most of the 

times it is needed to provide some kind of circuit for the energy to flow. For example, if 

we place a Casimir cavity in the space, nothing will happen because the excess of modes 

in the outside does not flow to the inside as they are not allowed there. We need a 

mechanism to transport the outside energy to the inside. This mechanism must in 

equilibrium with the vacuum outside, exchanging energy with it continuously. If we pull 

this mechanism inside it will drag some of the outside energy. However, inside the 

Casimir cavity, the equilibrium with the inside vacuum is no longer present and 

consequently the excess of energy will be released and the equilibrium with the medium 

will be restored. Finally, in the energy releasing process, the energy will be transmuted in 

a form that could be distinguishable of the ZPF and then collected and used by our 

apparatus. 

In this chapter, we start by presenting the basic concept to measure the atomic energy 

shift induced by a Casimir cavity and review the state of the art, describing a method 

available in the literature. We then consider new improvements to the method, and finish 

with some considerations needed to apply the initial concept to an experiment in the real 

word. 

4.1. The Proposed Method  

4.1.1. Earlier work 

Recently (2012), a paper by Dmitriyeva and Moddel [8] reports an experimental work 

where different gases are passed through Casimir cavities and the emitted radiation is 

collected. To simulate the Casimir cavities, they used nano-porous membranes (Whatman 



43 

 

polycarbonate Nuclepore track-etched flexible membranes with pore sizes of 0.1, 0.2, and 

0.4 ?m) coated with gold by thermal evaporation. These membranes were mounted in a 

stainless-steel vacuum system where a wide bandwidth SPH-49 pyroelectric detector 

from Spectrum Detectors Inc. was used for the radiative output measurements. This 

detector has a sensitivity of 1,9 × 104 ?/?  almost constant in the wavelength range 

from 0.6 to 5 ?m, so mostly in the infrared (IR) region. The flow was also modulated (at 

0.5 Hz) by closing and opening a valve connected to a mechanical vacuum pump. The 

pressure inside the chamber was kept in the range 1-10 torr. Different gases (Ar, Xe, He 

and N2) were used with gold-coated and uncoated membranes, with the flow rate also 

changed. Data have shown that, as the flow rate increases, the radiation collected also 

increases, as expected. However, more radiation emitted was expected to be observed for 

the coated membranes12 and these experiments revealed more radiation intensity for the 

uncoated membranes. The authors expected more radiation to be emitted for heavier 

atoms (such as Xe) since the valence electrons have more external orbits and consequently 

their orbit frequencies should be lower, and  so inside the cavities the modes closer to the 

resonant frequencies of these orbits are more suppressed relative to the case of lighter 

atoms, as discussed in section 3.5.1. Nevertheless, and contrary to expectations, the 

experimental results obtained in [8] have shown that more radiation was emitted for 

lighter atoms.  

4.1.2. Improvements to the earlier work 

The present work can be seen as an attempt to continue and improve the study 

presented by Dmitriyeva and Moddel [8]. In this section, we will point out some possible 

problems present in the earlier work and propose some modifications:  

 

1. First of all, as discussed in ref. [8], the main problem was the impossibility to 

separate the background from the hypothetical radiation emission caused by the 

ground state shift of the atoms. A variety of possible physical effects may origin 

emission of radiation in the infrared region at room temperature. In this way, we 

propose to make a spectroscopic study of the radiation emitted. If all the cavities 

have the same diameter, the ZPF inside the cavities will be equal (the same 

suppressed modes), then we would expect the shift in the ground state to be roughly 

                                                 
12 The metal coated membranes constitute a better approximation to the Casimir condition.  However, 

Lifshitz has shown that the fundamental effect exists also for any dielectric materials [25]. 



44 

 

the same, and for the same gas and membrane we would observe in a spectroscopic 

analysis a Gaussian distribution with centroid in the wavelength corresponding to 

the energy shift characteristic of this specific atom and cavity diameter13. 

2. Second, if necessary we can try to use membranes with pores of smaller diameter 

to increase the energy shift of the ground state and so decrease the emitted light 

wavelength towards the visible or UV region, making it easier to distinguish this 

radiation from the background.  

3. Another improvement that should increase the irradiated energy is the use of excited 

states instead of ground states. In the classical realm, the excited electrons travel in 

the outermost orbits, corresponding to lower angular frequencies. So the same 

cavity could induce a bigger shift for excited-state electrons than for ground-state 

electrons. We expect this behaviour because inside a cavity there is a smaller 

number of modes near the orbital frequency for an excited-state atom. This 

hypothesis is sustained by the study made in section 3.5.1. 

4. It is possible that the radiation correspondent to the ground state shift is also a 

forbidden mode inside the cavity. So if the atom cannot radiate, it could persist in 

the energy level of the ground state outside the cavity, which would correspond to 

an excited (of infinite lifetime) state inside the cavity. To solve this failure we 

propose a more complex method. We need then to give to the system some energy 

so that the system will release the supplied energy plus the shift. A more detailed 

explanation of this method is presented in section 4.1.3. 

4.1.3. Discussion of the two possible scenarios for the level shift mechanism 

If our main hypothesis of the atoms undergoing an energy level shift (in the ground 

or excited state) inside Casimir cavities is correct, then a crucial question persists: Is this 

shift instantaneous (progressive in a small time scale) or will the atom remain in an 

excited state until it decays by some mechanism (such as spontaneous emission)? This 

question influences the experiment that we will carry out and we consider here two 

different options: 

1. The ground state of the atom in the free space can behave as an excited state inside 

the cavity, thus it would keep the outside ground state for a period of time and 

                                                 
13 However, here we discriminate the wall-atom interaction. Since the Casimir-Polder and van der Waals 

interactions also induce energy shifts and these shifts have a great dependence on the wall distance, a 

narrower spectrum can be observed from the radiation emitted from atoms at different distances to the 

walls. 



45 

 

only then decay to the cavity ground state (similar to the spontaneous emission). 

In Ref. [8] it is suggested that the ground state atoms could enter the porous cavity 

and undergo a level shift to the cavity ground state only when they interact with 

the walls. This applies also to the excited states, so when the atom in an excited 

state enters the cavity, it decays by spontaneous emission, from the outside excited 

state to the cavity ground state, emitting radiation with energy equal to the ground 

state shift plus the energy of the excited state in the free space transition. 

2. If we look close to the SED theory, and consider an electron in a planetary-like 

orbit, in the absence of resonant ZPF modes it will decay in spiral as a 

consequence of the Abraham–Lorentz force, releasing radiation according to its 

instantaneous radius. This argument leads us to think that a change in the atomic 

level will be progressive when the resonant modes disappear, still it will look like 

an instantaneous reaction14. This applies to both ground and excited states. Then, 

if an atom in an existing state enters the cavity, its excited state undergoes a shift 

and, when the atom decays by spontaneous emission to the cavity ground state, it 

will emit radiation with energy equal to the difference between the cavity excited 

state and the cavity ground state. This energy will be smaller than the 

correspondent free space transition, since the energy shift of the excited level is 

higher than the energy shift of the ground state. 

4.1.4. Our concept to extract energy from the ZPF 

The first and the simplest experimental study we suggest is to pass atoms in the 

ground state through Casimir cavities and to analyse the radiation emitted. We propose 

to make a spectroscopic analysis for a fixed cavity size to test the hypothesis that the 

spectroscopic emission has a specific pattern resulting from the constant ground state 

shift. To compare and subtract the background, we should study the effect without 

cavities, with non-coated cavities and with metal-coated cavities. This spectroscopic 

analysis could be done in the IR region, however the problems described in 4.1.3 could 

interfere. So a spectral analysis in the visible and ultra-violet (UV) regions for different 

cavity sizes will be preferential. In our experiment, we intend to make a UV-visible 

analysis (160 to 550 nm) of monoatomic and polyatomic gases passing through 

aluminium coated porous membranes (0.4, 0.1 and 0.05 ?m).  

                                                 
14 If we remove the ZPF of an electron in the H atom at the Bohr radius, it takes approximately 1.2 ×
10?11 ? to reach the nucleus, so we consider these decays as instantaneous. 



46 

 

According to classic mechanics, an electron in an excited state (where we consider 

planetary-like orbits) has a bigger orbit, and so a lower angular frequency relative to its 

ground state. Thus, for the same cavity, we expect a larger shift in the excited state than 

in the ground state, since there are more suppressed modes near the resonant frequency 

in the case of the bigger orbit as demonstrated in section 3.5.1. Hence there will be a 

negative shift in the transition energy. 

For each of the two possible decay channels suggested in section 4.1.3, we propose 

a different method to extract the energy from the vacuum.  

For hypothesis 1, the atom is first excited to a resonance state, then goes inside a 

Casimir cavity in such a way that it decays there by spontaneous emission. As we expect 

the final state to be the shifted ground state, the energy of the radiation released would be 

the free space resonance transition energy plus the energy difference between the outside 

ground state and the cavity ground state. Once the atom goes out the cavity the ZPF 

reenergises the cavity ground state back again to the outside ground state. An 

exemplifying scheme of the concept is presented in figure 19. An important aspect in this 

scenario has to be taken into account, the spontaneous emission rate inside a Casimir 

cavity, or close to a reflective wall, is modified. This interesting behaviour related with 

the van der Waals and Casimir-Polder forces was predicted by QED [25] and SED [37], 

and was also observed experimentally [41]. An excited state can acquire a lifetime 20 

times longer than the lifetime in the free space [37], so the atoms will need to stay longer 

inside the cavity to decay. There is also a hypothesis that the outside excited state decays 

to the cavity excited state by spontaneous emission, releasing an energy equal to the 

energy difference between the states. This emitted radiation would be much less 

energetic, so harder to detect. 

For hypothesis 2, where we consider the decay to be instantaneous, the atom goes 

inside the cavity, where its ground and excited states undergo an energy shift, the excited 

state shift being larger than the ground state shift. Then we can excite a specific state 

inside the cavity with a small amount of energy relative to the energy needed in the free 

space. Once excited, the atom goes out the cavity and the ground and the excited states 

undergo again an energetic shift. When the atom decays by spontaneous emission in the 

free space, it releases an amount of energy larger than the one used to excite it. When the 

atom enters the cavity, it radiates the energy difference between the shifts, either if it 

enters in the ground state or in the excited state. Figure 20 exemplifies this process. 



47 

 

 

In any of these two cases, we observe a gain of energy between the energy provided 

and the one released, the ZPF being the source of the excess energy. 

Another interesting method related to the one proposed by Puthoff [29], and 

addressed in section 1.3, is based on the ionization and molecular dissociation energy 

shift. According to SED (at least with the approximation made in the present work), an 

 

Figure 19: A two-level atom in the free space has a characteristic transition energy ???. Inside 

the cavity, the ground state undergoes an energy shift from ?? to ???, releasing by spontaneous 

emission an energy ??? greater that ???. Again in the free space, the ZPF reenergises ??? 

back again to ??. Considering the hypothesis of the transition between the excited states outside 

and inside the cavity, the energy released will be ?? ? ???. 

 

Figure 20: A two-level atom in the free space has a characteristic transition energy ??1. If 

we irradiate the atom with an energy ??0 lower than ??1, the atom is not excited and remains 

in the ground state. However, inside the cavity, the ground and excited states undergo an energy 

shift from ?0 to ?0? and from ?1 to ?1?, respectively. Thus it is possible to excite the atom with 

??0. When the atom goes outside the cavity, the ZPF reenergises both the excited and ground 

states, and by spontaneous emission the atom releases an energy ??1 greater than ??0. 



48 

 

atom in the ground state (or in an excited state) should have ionization energy larger inside 

a cavity than in the free space. So the idea would be to first ionize the atom and then, 

when it goes inside the cavity and captures a free electron, it would emit an amount of 

energy larger than the one used to ionize it in the beginning. 

The use of molecules instead of single atoms would be maybe more accessible 

experimentally. If the molecules in the ground state were inside the cavity, where the 

vibrational resonant modes are suppressed (all or some of them), we would expect that 

the molecule dissociation energy would be greater than in free space. Thus we could 

dissociate the molecules before they enter the cavity and, once inside, if they recombine 

they could emit radiation more energetic than the one used to dissociate it in the 

beginning.  

4.2. Considerations for the implementation in the real world 

Until now, we made a series of proposals and estimations, but unfortunately they are, 

together with the computations of the energy shifts for the H atom performed in chapter 

3, difficult to transpose to the real world. The reader should understand that we are 

working somewhat blind, since SED is still a very immature theory. In the literature, the 

works in this area are scarce and the few that exist are essentially conceptual and don’t 

have in consideration the limitations imposed by the materials or the instrumentation 

properties. Hence in this section we try to point out some facts that could influence our 

theoretical assumptions.  

In chapters 2 and 3, we have studied the H atom, which is the simplest case. The 

heavier atoms have more electrons, thus one more term to account, the Coulomb force 

between the electrons. Consequently, the orbits will be more complex, with the possible 

arising of very exotic geometries, like in the case of the orbitals predicted by QM (orbitals 

p, d, f, etc.). Furthermore, the model discussed here does not take into account the electron 

spin (as in the SEDS case), which could change our actual scenario. 

4.2.1. Reflectance of Casimir cavity walls  

Metals are not perfectly reflective to the electromagnetic radiation and the reflectance 

is also dependent on the angle of the incidence and on the wavelength [42]. The 

penetration depth15 is an important parameter and also varies with frequency, being 

                                                 
15 Depth in a material for which the intensity of an incident wave decays to 1/e of its original value [42]. 



49 

 

around 20 nm for an incident wave of wavelength 200 nm, for typical metals [42]. These 

parameters will influence our theoretical model, where we considered a perfectly 

reflective cavity. 

The Casimir condition (a small cavity with perfectly conductive walls) is hard to 

accomplish in the real world, still we should try to make the best approximation.  

In typical metals, if we treat the electrons as free particles, they will move according 

to the frequency of the incoming electromagnetic wave and then this wave will be 

reflected. However, above the metal plasma frequency, the electrons cannot move quickly 

enough to reflect this incoming wave [42]. So the metals are not good reflectors for higher 

frequencies, which could propagate inside a cavity even if its size is small enough to 

suppress them. Thus, even if we continue decreasing the cavity size, the metal reflectivity 

will impose a limit (related to the metal plasma frequency) on the perturbation caused by 

the ZPF.  

In order to suppress the largest amount of normal modes inside the cavity we should 

use for the Casimir cavity wall a highly reflective metal whose reflectance extends to 

higher frequencies. The reflectance as a function of the incident radiation wavelength for 

various films made of gold, silver, aluminium, copper, rhodium and titanium is presented 

in figure 21. 

 

 

Figure 21: Reflectance of films of gold (Au), silver (Ag), aluminium (Al), copper 

(Cu), rhodium (Rh) and titanium (Ti) as a function of the incident radiation wavelength 

[43]. 



50 

 

 

Aluminium is the best choice for the cavity wall since it is the most reflective metal 

in the UV region16. Gold is often used in Casimir experiments (for example refs. [18] 

[19]) since it has a high reflectance, almost 100%, but only for lower frequencies. As 

these experiments made studies with walls of thicknesses in the ?m range, which suppress 

only the wavelengths longer than the ones in the IR region, the gold coating was a good 

option. However, for the nanometre scale that we intend to explore in this work, Al is the 

most suitable choice.  

4.2.2. Geometry and orientation issues 

The computer simulations of chapter 3 were performed for cubic cavities. However 

it is more practical to pass gas atoms through a structure with a small aperture or by a 

narrow tube. In these cases, the ZPF is only perturbed for the modes that travel in 

directions orthogonal to the walls. In this way, the influence in the average atomic orbit 

will depend on the orbit orientation. As we have seen in section 3.6, the deviation of an 

electron from the initial motion plane is almost negligible, at least in the time scale 

investigated. So, if we consider its orbit restricted to a fixed plane, the atom self-rotation 

will define the orbit orientation.  

An atom in random linear and rotational motions, as in a gas molecular flow, will be 

affected by the ZPF perturbations according to its instantaneous orientation. This scenario 

is hard to predict; however, we expect that there will be an observable average energy 

level shift even inside a narrow Casimir tube, instead of a box. 

 

 

                                                 
16 In addition to figure 21, the Aluminium reflectance is approximately constant down to ~80 ??,  where 
it drops abruptly. Other metals such as Copper, Platinum, Chromium, Silver and Gold already have a 

reflectance lower than 20% at ~90 ??. 



51 

 

5. Experimental apparatus 

In this chapter we start by describing the basic concept of our experiment and then 

we give technical information about each component of our system and about the data 

acquisition instrumentation. 

5.1. General Description 

In section 4.1 we suggested and described some methods for extraction of energy 

from the ZPF. Now we propose an experimental apparatus to implement some of these 

methods.  

The main idea of the methods proposed is interchanging atoms between the free space 

and a Casimir cavity. To materialise this concept, we flow gases (monoatomic and 

molecular) through a nano-porous membrane coated with aluminium. Since we are using 

gases, to reach an appropriate level of purity we designed and built a vacuum stainless 

steel system. Besides providing the necessary vacuum, this system allows the gas flow 

through the porous membrane. To analyse the spectrum of the radiation emitted we use a 

monochromator coupled to a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT). For the tests where we need 

to radiate a specific wavelength, we use another monochromator coupled to a lamp that 

emits in a continuous spectrum. This apparatus allow us to study almost all the hypotheses 

proposed in section 4.1.4. Figure 22 shows a simple schematic of our apparatus. 

 

 



52 

 

5.1.1. The nano-porous membranes 

A Casimir cavity is a region in space where some of the ZPF modes are suppressed. 

Modifying the ZPF is trivial, in fact all the matter induces local perturbations on the ZPF, 

however between two conductive and neutral walls the perturbation in the ZPF is greater, 

mainly for the ZPF waves that propagate orthogonally to the walls. Pores with a 

cylindrical form are even better than a pair of walls, since they suppress the modes that 

propagate in two perpendicular directions. Hence, the use of a membrane with numerous 

holes whose internal walls are coated with a metallic layer could be a good choice.  

We used in our experiment Nuclepore Track-Etched Polycarbonate membranes from 

Whatman (supplied by GE Healthcare Life Sciences). These membranes, mostly used as 

filters for fluids, have discrete pores sharply defined, high flow rates, and excellent 

chemical and thermal resistances. They are fabricated from a thin film of polycarbonate 

through a combination of charged particle bombardment (or irradiation) and chemical 

etching. They have a thickness of only 7 to 20 ?m but burst strength larger than 10 psi 

(0,69 bar), which is more than enough for our applied differential pressure. The maximum 

operation temperature is 140 ºC, which allows for thermal evaporation without

deformation risk. Its porosity (void volume) lies in the 4-20% range, and the pore density 

lies in the range of 105 up to 6 × 108 pores cm2? . 

We got three different types of membranes, with pore diameters of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.4 

?m. We assembled them in copper supports using a low outgassing epoxy glue to prevent 

any gas flow other than the one flowing through the pores. In figure 23 we can see a 

picture of a membrane glued to the copper holder.  

The process used to coat the membranes is thermal evaporation with aluminium. To 

coat the maximum depth into the pores we made four evaporations, placing the membrane 

in four different angles of 45º. The faces of these membranes are slight different, one is 

perfectly planar and the other is rougher, and we coated only the planar face. 

 

To verify the existence of nano-pores,  to confirm its size, uniformity and density, 

we analysed a membrane of pores with 100 nm diameters with a scanning electron 

microscope (SEM). The results are shown in figure 24. 

As expected, the membrane has well distributed pores with a large density, and their 

sizes are according to the specifications.

5.1.2. Monochromators 

To irradiate the main chamber and to analyse the radiation emitted two 

monochromators (MC) were used, both of them from ACTON ARC, Model VM-502.  

They are nominal 0.2 meter evacuable monochromators with an optimum wavelength 

range in the vacuum ultraviolet region. The grating mounted in both the MCs is a standard 

1200 G/mm, which allows a wavelength range 30 - 546 nm (approximated values). The 

focal length is 0.2 meters, the aperture ratio f/4.5 and the grating coating is made of 

Aluminium and MgF2. 

One MC (from now on named MC1) was used as spectrum analyser and its step-

motor controlled by the ACTON SpectraDriver-SD3. This controlling device allows the 

MC operation to be controlled by software, which is very practical. The other MC (named 

MC2) was used to irradiate the membrane and is controlled by the ACTON SpectraDrive-

SD, equipped with a display and a keypad allowing the MC operation. Both the 

controllers allow specifying the scanning rate and the wavelength range. 

It is recommended by the manufacturer that for spectroscopy in the VUV region (less 

than 200 nm wavelengths) the MC should be evacuated at least down to a pressure of 

6.7 × 10?4 mbar. 

The light entrance and exit flanges of the MCs have slits, vertical (internally 

adjustable) and horizontal (adjustable outside by a micrometre scaled knob). The

planar face of the membrane, coated with 40 nm of palladium, is shown. The right

of 100000×.

horizontal slits have the important task of controlling the MC resolution. The narrower 

this slit is the better will be the MC resolution. However the light intensity is also smaller 

and for our purposes it may be necessary to maximize the light collected or emitted. Thus 

we needed to find the best compromise between the light collection/emission and the 

resolution required. The entrance and the exit slits have influence on the resolution, and 

the best compromise was found to be when they are the two equally open. So, whatever 

the required resolution is, the entrance and the exit slits must have the same gap, this is 

true for both the horizontal and vertical slits. Although less significant, the vertical slits 

also influence the MC resolution. Preliminary tests with our system have shown that the 

better compromise for the vertical slits is achieved for MC1 and MC2 entrance and exit 

slits with 2 ??.  

5.1.3. The gaseous chamber and the vacuum system 

The main chamber, where the membrane is mounted, is made of stainless steel and 

is composed of three parts. Two of them are symmetric in order to adapt to the 

entrance/exit of the MCs. Each of these pieces was designed by us (using Autodesk 

Inventor software) and is formed by a flange (that couples to the MC) soldered to a KF25 

tube with the respective flange in the opposite side.  

The KF25 tubes were made the shortest possible (~35 ??) in order to minimise the 

membrane-MC distance and therefore maximize the solid angle. The flanges that couple 

to the MC have an opening (26 ?? diameter) that allows the light to pass through. In 

order to hermetically isolate the MC from the chamber, we used an MgF2 window sealed 

with two Viton o-rings placed between each MC and the chamber. We chose this material 

(MgF2) because it has a transparency above 80% for wavelengths down to 160 nm, where 

it starts to slightly decrease, reaching 60% at 120 nm.  To each of the symmetric pieces 

that compose the chamber we soldered a Swagelok flange (VCR ¼ inch) that will couple 

to the vacuum and the gas flow system. The third piece of the main chamber is a bellows 

or flexible coupling tube (minimum length ~5 ??), which helps the assembling and 

alignment between the two MCs. The bellows is connected between the other two pieces 

by centring-rings. The membrane, assembled in the KF25 centring-rings shown in figure 

26, is pressed between the flexible coupling tube and the KF25 flange of one of symmetric 

pieces (the one closer to MC1). A schematic representation of our system is shown in 

figure 26 and a photo of the system is shown in figure 25.

the black lines are vacuum tubes. The distance between the two MCs is 14 cm. The distances 

from the membrane to MC1 and MC2 are respectively4.5 and 9.5 cm.  

Membrane 



57 

 

The vacuum system is composed by two turbo-molecular vacuum pumps (T1 and T2, 

each one coupled to a rotary pump). T1 evacuates the two MCs and a part of the remaining 

vacuum system. Before filling the gas, the vacuum system is first evacuated with the two 

pumps simultaneously pumping. For this purpose, the reduction-valve (at the exit of the 

bottle) is closed and the rest of the valves in the system are open. This task requires some 

caution since the differential pressure between the two sides of the membrane can damage 

it.  

To place the gas inside the system valve V4 is closed and, through the reduction valve 

(the one immediately following to the gas bottle), the volume between these two valves 

is filled (including vessel 1).  

To make the gas flow through the membrane, the valves connecting the vacuum 

system to the pumps (V6 and V3) are closed. Note that the two MCs can continue being 

evacuated by T1, which is crucial to keep low levels of air inside the MCs during our 

experiment.  Then, to isolate the two sides of the membrane, valve V1 is also closed. To 

collect the gas after it passes through the membrane, vessel 2 is submersed in liquid 

nitrogen (LN2). V4 is also completely open and the needle valve (V2) allows controlling 

the gas flow through the membrane. Pirani 1 and pirani 2 give us information about the 

differential pressure between the two sides of the membrane. We use this information to 

estimate the relative17 gas flow through the membrane. Finally, to recollect the gas in 

vessel 1, valve V1 is open and the nitrogen is changed from vessel 2 to vessel 1, leading 

to gas liquefaction in vessel 1. The gas can be stored in this volume by closing valve V4. 

5.1.4. The Light source 

The light source used is an ACTON product, ARC Model DS-775 Deuterium Light 

Source. The useful wavelength range of this source is from 115 nm to 370 nm, with a 

continuum from 165 nm to 370 nm and many lines from 115 nm to 165 nm. Physically 

this device is very compact and couples perfectly to MC2. The beam section is 

approximately 1 mm in diameter and is located 10.16 cm away from the MC2 entry 

flange. The source has a typical Lyman-alpha radiance of over one miliwatt per mm2-nm-

steradian. In figure 27, the lamp output spectrum is plotted, as given by the manufacturer. 

The highest line corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line of deuterium (the theoretical value

precise neither properly calibrated for the gases used.

is 1215.31 Å [44]). This resonance line will be used to calibrate the offset of the MC 

grating 

5.1.5. PMT and data acquisition 

The PMT used is model R8020-06SEL manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics. It is 

equipped with a bialkali photocathode and it has low radioactivity, active area of 26 mm2, 

10 stage dynodes and a head-on type synthetic silica window. Its spectroscopic response 

lies in the range from 160 to 650 nm. The cathode sensitivity is typically 100 ?A/lm and 

the quantum efficiency at 175 nm is 30%.  It was assembled in an E10411MOD 

Hamamatsu socket with maximum voltage +1000 V and a divider current of 364 ?A (at 

+1000 V). 

The PMT was polarized by a HV-board (NHQ-206L). The PMT signal was collected 

by a Canberra 2005 pre-amplifier and then amplified in a Tennelec TC 243 linear 

amplifier and digitalized in a Nucleus multi-channel analyser (MCA) connected to a 

computer, where a graphical interface allows to visualise the pulse height distribution. 

The best choice of the amplifier parameters to distinguish photons counted from the noise 

level was found by visualizing the plots in the MCA. The coarse and fine gains were 

respectively 100 and 5 and the peaking time was 1 ?s, while the PMT socket polarization 

was 950V. The pulses were also visualized in a Tektronix TDS 210 oscilloscope.  

Nucleus is the native MCA software and it is possible to program it for continuous 

multi-acquisition. For example, Nucleus can acquire without interruption 1000 spectra of 

1 second each (the minimum acquisition time). These spectra were saved in independent 

files (.spm extension). These files can then be converted to ASCII format (using the 

software Specon 2000 v1.3) and thus easily handled using MATLAB. The number of

function of wavelength. This image comes from the device manual. 



59 

 

acquisitions and the acquisition time should be chosen according with the MC scanning 

range and rate in such a way that the MC and the Nucleus start and finish at the same 

time. Subsequently an algorithm (SpeGen) was developed in MATLAB that, for each file,  

countsthe number of photons collected,  and plots the spectrum of the light collected as 

function of the wavelength.  

This method requires the perfect synchronization between the start of the Nucleus 

acquisition and the MC operation. However, even if the two systems start with a delay of 

for example half of a second, in the worst scenario (when the scan speed is the highest, 

10 nm/s) the error in the spectrum will be 0.083 nm, which would mean a constant shift 

of 0.0083 nm in the entire spectrum relative to the true values. 

5.1.6. Gases choice 

The gas used in a first stage should be a noble gas for two reasons: noble gases are 

inert so they won’t react with other materials and, therefore, their handling is very simple; 

usually they are monoatomic gases so at proper pressures we have a clean line-type 

absorption/emission atomic spectrum.  

Since we intend to study some specific atomic transitions, we must eliminate all the 

possible light emission in other wavelengths. Then we must reduce any decay channel 

other than the resonance fluorescence. This can be accomplished by reducing the gas 

pressure to a few mbar [45]. 

In a next stage polyatomic gases may also be used to study the molecular bound 

energy shifts induced by Casimir cavities.  

5.2. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations 

To better understand the behaviour of the electromagnetic radiation incidence in the 

porous membrane and the flow of gas molecules through the membrane, we made some 

simulations using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. 

5.2.1. Gas flow dynamics 

As we intend to use low pressures (up to a few mbar), for nanometric pores we 

believe that the gas flow will always stay in the molecular flow regime. Our membranes 

have 50, 100 and 400 nm pore-diameters, so we will consider the bigger ones to estimate 

the maximum pressure at which it is still valid to consider a molecular flow. We want to 

confirm if in our system we will always have a molecular flow and then make the 



60 

 

simulations accordingly. In agreement with ref. [46], we can use the Knudsen number 

(which relates the molecule mean free path with the pipe diameter) to estimate if a flux is 

in the molecular or viscous regime. Considering the pores as pipes of diameter 400 nm 

and the gas molecules with diameter 216 pm (xenon atomic diameter [47]) at room 

temperature, we found out the maximum pressure at which the molecular flow regime is 

still valid to be ~496 mbar. As we will use much lower pressures, we will consider the 

gas flow through the membrane to be in the molecular regime.  

Hence we simulated the gas atoms considering them as free particles and tracking 

each atom. Thus, they obey to the Newton classic laws of motion with initial and after-

collision random velocities and orientations (Monte Carlo method). Some other 

approximations were made: the model follows the Kinetic Molecular Theory, the particles 

don´t collide with each others and the simulation was made in two dimensions. The molar 

mass of the gas is 28 g/mol, the temperature is 25ºC and the pressure 100 Pa (1 mbar). 

Our main purpose here is to estimate the average time for an atom to cross the 

membrane, so we idealize the worst porosity scenario, a highly irregular porous 

distribution (with broader time distribution of the crossing atoms), as shown in figure 28. 

We made the membrane with average pore size of 200 nm, and thickness of 1700 nm, 

which is thinner than our membranes.  

A great number of particles (few tens of thousands) were emitted against the 

membrane; the ones that have returned back or have gone outside the model limits are 

considered frozen. We tracked the remaining particles until they reach the opposite 

membrane side.  

In figure 28 we can see the path of each atom when the simulation is finished (a), in 

this particular example only two of them being able to cross the membrane, and the actual 

position of the particles while the simulation is still running (b). 

 



61 

 

This simulation allows computing the number of particles that crossed the membrane 

as a function of time. In this way, we can estimate the average time to cross the membrane. 

In figure 29 we present (blue dots) the time distribution of the particles crossing the 

membrane and a smoothed curve (red) of this data to better understand its behaviour since 

our data have poor statistics.

membrane with 1700 nm thickness and an averaged pore side of 200 nm. The particles are

simulation stops, for an initial number of particles of 500 and a total time of 10?7 ?. b) Particle 

position while the simulation is still running, for an initial number of particles of 50000 and a 

total time of 10?8 ?. The colours of the paths and particles are related to their velocity, in a 

rainbow scale, the blue ones are the slower and the red ones the faster.

b) 



62 

 

Now we have a more clear idea about the typical times that the gas atoms take to 

cross a porous membrane.  

To know if an excited atom can cross the membrane without decaying by 

spontaneous emission, we will compare the typical lifetime of the resonant states with the 

travel time through a membrane. The first resonance states that decay by spontaneous 

emission have typical lifetimes of a few nanoseconds [48][49]. As an example, for two 

resonance states of Xe, 3P1 (we intend to use it in our experiment) and 
1P1, the lifetimes 

were experimentally measured, being respectively (3.79 ± 1.12)  × 10?9 ? and (3.17 ±

0.19)  × 10?9 ? [50]. As seen, these values are at least one order of magnitude shorter 

than the average time for an atom to cross a 1700 nm membrane. So we can conclude 

that, if an excited atom enters the membrane, most likely it will decay inside, and if an 

atom gets excited inside the membrane it can only decay outside if it gets excited near the 

exit.  

We should still note that we do not consider the lifetime modification induced by the 

Casimir cavity. As we also did not consider how deep inward the pores we can coat using 

the metal evaporation technique. So the membrane effective thickness will be different 

from the original thickness. 

5.2.2. Electromagnetic dynamics through the pores 

As the wavelengths used in the experiment (VUV region) are of the same order of 

magnitude than the pore size, we expect a wave-like behaviour. To have a clear idea about 

 

Figure 29: Number of particles arriving at the bottom of the membrane as a function of 

time. In blue, we show the results of the simulation; in red, a smooth curve following the blue 

points. The smooth curve peak is approximately at 3.5 × 10?8 ?. 



63 

 

the light propagation through the pores, we made some simulations with the COMSOL 

software using classic electrodynamics. For simplicity and due to computer limitations, 

we performed the simulation again in two dimensions. 

The membrane pores were represented by 3 small holes (in 2D) crossing an 

aluminium block. The remaining area of our simulation was filled with air. The 

electromagnetic waves were generated by electric oscillating dipoles whose frequency 

gives us the desired radiation wavelength. To simulate all radiation polarizations, the 

dipoles have perpendicular directions between each other.  

First we put a set of dipoles in one side of the membrane and analysed the radiation 

crossing the pores. Then we vary the diameter (D) of the pores and their thickness (L). 

Some results are shown in figure 30.

crossing the membrane for different membrane sizes: a) D = 75 nm and L = 2000 nm; b) D =

The radiation wavelength was 200 nm for all the plots. The colours are related to the power

64 

 

As expected, for pore diameters much smaller than the radiation wavelength there is 

a great attenuation, as we can see in figure 30 a). It is also evident the wave-like behaviour 

of the light for pore sizes with the same order of magnitude than the wavelength. For 

example, in figure 30 a) and b), we can see that the light has an interference pattern and 

comes out from the pores in all directions. In figure 30 c) and d), the immerging light has 

a behaviour more similar to a beam since the holes have already a size twice the 

wavelength. It is also clear that the shorter holes, shown in figure 30 d), allow more light 

to pass through them than the longer ones, shown in figure 30 c). 

Subsequently we computed the radiation transmittance through the membrane as a 

function of the hole diameter. The radiation wavelength was fixed at 200 nm and we 

computed the total power collected at the membrane exit. The power transmittance is 

shown in figure 31. As expected the transmittance is higher for larger pores and almost 

zero for pore sizes smaller than half of the radiation wavelength.  

To have a clear idea of the radiation propagation when emitted from inside the pores, 

we simulated the electric dipoles inside them. For that, we placed two dipoles in the centre 

of each pore, one with the same orientation of the pore walls (P1) and the other one with 

orientation perpendicular to the walls (P2).  

First, we studied the differences in the dipole orientations and noticed that, for small 

diameters (L = 40 nm) the radiation is almost fully suppressed for P1 but not for P2. This 

behaviour was expected since the electric dipoles emit mostly in its perpendicular 

intensity so that in the rainbow scale the red is the higher power and the blue the lower. The 

colour scale is similar in all the plots.

wavelength is 200 nm and the pore thickness is 2000 nm.

direction, thus for P1 the radiation is reflected in the walls and then suppressed (Casimir 

condition). 

Next, we made several simulations varying the pore dimensions with the two internal 

dipoles (P1 and P2). Two examples of the results are shown in figure 32, where it is 

possible to note, in a) and b), that for larger D values there is much more radiation coming 

out of the largest holes, an evident effect of the suppressive influence of the cavities when 

they are shorter than the radiation wavelength. 

We also made some simulations for the highly porous membrane model used in 

section 5.2.1 by varying the radiation wavelength. We noticed that, for shorter radiation 

wavelengths, the penetration in the membrane and its transmittance is higher. An example 

is shown in figure 32 c), where it is perceptible the light preferential paths and some zones 

where the light was mostly suppressed.

6. Results and discussion 

6.1. Preliminary tests and calibration 

Before we started our experiments it was necessary to perform some tests and 

calibrations, particularly of the MCs. These are described in the following sections. 

6.1.1. Delay correction of the Nucleus multi-spectrum utility 

After we’ve acquired some spectrum we noticed an annoying problem in the Nucleus 

multi-spectrum utility. When we started the MC driver at the same time that the Nucleus 

software we observed that the Nucleus always continued the acquisition (and generated 

new files) a few seconds after the MC stopped. The origin of the problem was a small 

(much less than 1 second) delay every time the program saved a file. We performed a test 

for different conditions and concluded that the delay was related with the file name length. 

We then operated the Nucleus so that it saved all the files with the same filename length 

and observed that the delay was always the same. 

In order to solve this Nucleus feature, we improved our MATLAB code (SpeGen) so 

that it would take into account this delay and make the corrections. 

6.1.2. Choice of the MCA counting window 

Each pulse height distribution recorded by the Nucleus PCA has a considerable 

amount of noise which can attributed to several phenomena. Therefore, integrating the 

counts in all channels is not the best option. Instead we’ve used a window of channels 

which corresponds to the photon counts. In figure 33 there is an example of a typical pulse 

height distribution spectrum when the PMT is irradiated directly by the lamp. The 

prominent peak corresponds to the pulse amplitude distribution of typical photon counts 

which adopts the expected Gaussian distribution. To determine if the centroid of this 

distribution changes with the counting rating we’ve taken a set of spectra with distinct 

counting rates and fit a gauss function superimposed on a linear background to each one. 

Lastly, with the fitting output information we plot the variation of the Gaussian centroid 

as a function of its amplitude. The As result we’ve observed a very evident non variation, 

showing that we can use a fixed channel interval to analyse our spectrum. This interval 

goes from the channel 100 to the channel 240. This range was chosen, taking into account 



67 

 

the centroid and FWHM of the gauss and also the shape of the background noise 

distribution. 

In figure 33 a second structure at the right side of the gauss curve is also visible. This 

structure becomes similar to the main peak when the incident photon rate is increased. In 

such cases we noticed that the channel corresponding to the centroid of this peak is exactly 

the double of the main peak. This lead us to conclude that this second peak was generated 

when two photons reached the photocathode with a small time difference being the 

resulting primary charge doubled relatively to when only a single photon reaches the 

photocathode. The resulting output pulse is also doubled. We notice also that, when the 

incident photon rate is much greater, several peaks started to appear. The centroids 

channel of these peaks were integer multiples of the main peak. These peaks are almost 

impossible to distinguish since they overlap with each other and with a giant background 

noise. For this reason we will avoid working in such high rate conditions. This is possible 

since we can control the amount of light collected by closing the horizontal MC slits 

(which also increases its resolution).    

In figure 33 we also plotted a typical MCA spectra recorded without PMT irradiation 

were a considerable amount of noise is visible, even in the channel window that we’ve 

selected (channel 100 to 240). This background is not subtracted since we are not 

interested in absolute values but only in relative ones and the pulse height distribution

(related to the intensity18 of the collected radiation) doesn’t change its form due to the 

background (which is constant for all the wavelengths).  

6.1.3. Light attenuation with the pressure 

The wavelengths below 200 nm are strongly absorbed by the matter, including the 

air [51] and, to allow its transmission in a closed apparatus, it must be evacuated. This is 

the reason why this range of the electromagnetic spectrum is called Vacuum UV (VUV). 

At shorter wavelengths (until ~150 ??) the main absorber present in the air is the 

oxygen, being possible to use nitrogen atmospheres to transmit these wavelengths. 

However for shorter wavelengths even nitrogen becomes an absorber. 

To ensure that the vacuum achievable inside the MCs does not affect their 

functionality we’ve performed a simple test and measured the radiation attenuation across 

the MC optical path, as a function of the pressure inside the MC.  

For this we’ve used MC2 (it has demonstrated to have the poorest vacuum quality) 

and assembled the PMT at the MC output flange and the deuterium lamp at the input, 

while evacuating the setup using T1.  

To measure the pressure inside the MC we’ve used a pirani and a penning vacuum 

gauges assembled directly in a third MC vacuum flange. These monochromators are 

equipped with 3 input/output flanges. Two of them are used in our measurements as input 

and output for the radiation. The third flange was not used in our main experiment and is 

only used when different geometrical MC configurations are necessary.  

To figure the relative light intensity we’ve summed all the counts between the 

channels 100 and 220 of the pulse height distribution, without any background 

subtraction. To change the pressure inside the MC we’ve closed the vacuum pump valve 

for a while and, to achieve higher pressures, we slightly opened the air inlet valve (there 

is a valve embedded in the MC which connects directly with the atmospheric pressure). 

The wavelength was fixed at 170 nm and the two slits were adjusted to 45 ?m. The light 

intensity as a function of the pressure inside the MC is shown in figure 34. 

                                                 
18 Every time we refer to light intensity this is not an absolute quantity. Since in our experiment we are 

not interested in measure absolute values but only its variation with some other parameter, our light 

intensity is just a quantity proportional to the number of photons which the PMT collects. 



69 

 

We can now conclude that in fact there is some attenuation when the pressure inside 

the MC is increased. However it only happens at higher pressures, for lower pressures the 

variation is almost inexistent. For the pressures at which we will operate at (less than 2 ×

10?3 ????) the attenuation is negligible and thus we conclude that the residual air 

absorption in our system does not play an important role, at least for the wavelength that 

we’ve used in this measurement (170 nm). 

It’s important to refer that the vacuum gauges used are not perfectly calibrated and 

some of these measurements were done in the limits of their sensitivity range. These 

factors make the absolute values measured doubtful; however as we’ve used these same 

vacuum gauges in our main experiment, this study was enough to estimate the required 

vacuum (measured with these gauges) in order to minimize the light attenuation. 

6.1.4. MCs calibration  

For the calibration of the MC we’ve used the Lyman-alpha line of the deuterium 

whose theoretical value is 1215.31 Å [44] since we don’t have the exact information 

relative to the other lines observed in the spectrum. As the reader may notice, this 

wavelength is outside of our PMT working range (160 - 650 nm). However we observed 

that, even with reduced quantum efficiency, the PMT was able to detect light under its 

lower limit. Then, for each of the MCs, we’ve assembled the lamp on their input flange 

and the PMT directly on the output flange. We then made a scan in a range were we would 

expect to find the 1215.31 Å resonant line. A typical spectrum (already offset corrected) 

obtained for MC1 is shown in figure 35. We can now compare our spectrum with the one

provided in the ARC VUV Deuterium Source manual (figure 27) and conclude that our 

instrumentation is working accordingly with the manufacturer specifications. 

 

In order to accurately determine the offset of the monochromators, we made a new 

scan (for MC1 and for MC2) focused in the range where we found the Lyman-alpha line. 

This new scan had a slower scan rate and more data points per wavelength unit. Lastly

at 3 mm. Acquisition time at each wavelenght  = 3 ?. Scanning rate = 4 Å/min.

71 

 

we made a fit of a Gaussian plus a linear function to the Lyman-alpha peak. The fitting 

parameters allowed us to compute the MC offset and FHWM, figure36. 

The MC1 driver allowed the automatic offset correction by inserting in the software 

a specific value; however for the MC2 driver the only solution is the operator to manually 

insert the desired wavelength taking in account the offset.  

6.2. Experimental results and discussion 

After calibrating all the instrumentation and confirming that the system is working 

properly we continued for the main experience.  

We’ve used two membranes with pore diameter of 0.1 ?m, one uncoated and the 

other coated with Aluminium. The membrane was evaporated four times in two 

perpendicular directions for two opposite 45º angles (relatively to the path of the 

evaporated Al). Taking into account the size of the pores, in order to avoid obstructing 

them, the thickness of each film was of 5 nm. This value was read from a plane surface 

orthogonal to the evaporation path, and at the same distance from the source as the 

membrane. We’ve only coated one side of the membrane, the less roughened. After the 

evaporation we’ve assembled the membrane with the coated side facing the MC2 light 

exit (which also corresponded to the gas inlet on the main chamber). 

In all the spectra of this section, we’ve considered only the events between the 

channels 100 and 240 (from the Nucleus MCA pulse height distribution files). For each 

wavelength, the counts in these channels were summed, being this sum a point in the 

following spectra, which present the radiation intensity as a function of the wavelength. 

For some of the spectrums the acquisition time for each wavelength was longer than 1 

second. In these cases the number of events was normalised to 1 second.  

We start by studying the shifts in the atomic ground state using only the MC1 

connected to the PMT, which analysed the radiation emitted from the main chamber. In 

our preliminary tests we observed that the PMT sensitivity starts to rise abruptly for 

wavelengths above 1500 nm and, since the MC upper wavelength limit is 5500 nm we 

have scanned the range going from 1500 nm to 5500 nm. In another preliminary test 

we’ve confirmed that if we closed the MC1 entrance the background was the same that 

when the main chamber was evacuated and the MC1 was open. Therefore we conclude 

that there is no radiation in the main chamber when it is in vacuum and that, in our 

measurements, we can consider as background the signal recorded when the MC1 

entrance is closed.  



72 

 

We then made a set of scans for different conditions: 1) background scan: before the 

principal measurements with the MC1 entrance closed, measuring the signals from the 

PMT + MC1; 2) with Xe flowing through the uncoated membrane; 3) with Xe flowing 

through the Al-coated membrane; 4) with a greater Xe flow rate through the Al-coated 

membrane; 5) background scan, taken after the data taking, again with the MC1 entrance 

closed.  

 

Figure 34:  Photon intensity as a function of the wavelength for different conditions: 1) 

background at the beginning of the experiment – taken with the MC1 entrance closed; slits = 

505 ?m; scan rate = 100 Å/min;  MCA acquisition time = 1 s. 2) scan with the uncoated 

membrane with Xe flowing; differential pressure of ~0.3 ????; slits = 505 ?m; scan rate = 

100 Å/min;  MCA acquisition time = 1 s. 3) scan with the Al-coated membrane with Xe 

flowing; differential pressure of ~0.3 ????; slits = 505 ?m; scan rate = 100 Å/min;  MCA 

acquisition time = 1 s. 4) scan with the Al-coated membrane with higher Xe flowing; 

differential pressure of ~0.4 ????;slits = 5005 ?m; scan rate = 200 Å/min; MCA acquisition 

time = 1 s. 5) background at the end of the experiment; MC2 entrance closed; slits = 5005 ?m; 

scan rate = 200 Å/min; MCA acquisition time = 1 s. 



73 

 

The results of these scans are plotted in figure 34. For each case the entrance and exit 

slits aperture was the same, for some of the measurements the slits aperture was larger to 

allow a greater light entrance, and for other cases the aperture was smaller to improve the 

resolution. For the cases when there was Xe flowing through the chamber, we controlled 

the flow by adjusting a needle valve (located at the gas inlet of the main chamber). The 

differential pressure between the two sides of the membrane allowed to estimate the gas 

flow through the membrane. 

Since it’s difficult to observe the differences between the individual plots of figure 

34 we made a smooth curve to each spectrum and compared them in the same plot (figure 

35). Without the smooth curve it would be visually very confuse to present all the data in 

the same plot. 

We can see some interesting differences between the curves presented in figure 35. 

For the coated membrane it is possible to see a photon intensity greater at shorter 

 

Figure 35: Smoothing of the curves presented in figure 34. The smoothing was the same 

for all the curves. The legends and axis have the same meaning as in figure 34. 



74 

 

wavelengths and, while for the uncoated membrane the same behaviour is present, it is 

not so noticeable. Moreover these two spectrum are globally slightly higher than the two 

background spectrums. However we made another scan were we’ve used the coated 

membrane but for a greater flow rate and greater slits aperture (coated greater flow series 

in figures 34 and 35) but in this we’ve recorded a photon intensity similar to the one of 

the background. This last test suggests that the difference in the two other scans can be 

attributed to a fluctuation of the instrumentation and not to the radiation detected by our 

PMT. Nevertheless the two first tests with Xe flowing are coherent with our proposals, 

since more radiation it was observed for the coated (for which the ZPF modes are more 

effectively suppressed) than for the uncoated membrane. However a more careful study 

is required in the future, since we cannot conclude for now if there was radiation emitted 

from the main chamber, or not.  

In another measurement we’ve used the MC2 to irradiate the main chamber with a 

selected wavelength. The Xe is the noble gas which has the lowest energy resonance 

transition of the noble gases [45], which is an advantage for our purposes, since our PMT 

was designed for a relatively low energy range (160 - 650 nm). The lower resonance 

energy level of Xe is the 3P1, whose transition energy relatively to the ground state is 8.43 

eV (~147.1 nm), hence we used that transition. Unfortunately this transition wavelength 

is outside the PMT working range but, since we were able to perform spectroscopy 

measurements for wavelengths much lower (for example until 110 nm, figure 27 ) then, 

if there is enough radiation reaching the PMT, it could be possible to distinguish the Xe 

emission from the noise and to make a reliable spectroscopic analysis. 

One of the methods proposed in section 4.1 suggests that if we excited the atoms with 

some characteristic wavelength, once inside the Casimir-cavity they could radiate and 

emit a lower wavelength that the one with which the atoms were excited. To study this 

effect we irradiated the Xe atoms outside of the membrane with using a wavelength of 

147.1 nm (first resonance transition of Xe) and, then made the gas flow thought the nano-

pores, while in other side of the membrane we analysed the radiation emitted using MC1. 

The resulting spectrum is shown in figure 36. 



75 

 

We cannot see in figure 36 the expected radiation emitted for wavelengths shorter 

than 147.1 nm, however we cannot also see the excitation wavelength (147.1 nm). This 

last observation suggests that system is not sensitive enough for this wavelength range.  

It is also possible that the wavelength emitted is shorter than the analysed range lower 

limit, which would be observed in the case a larger than expected ground state shift would 

occur. 

We then proceeded  to other method, also proposed in section 4.1.4, according to 

which if we irradiate the atoms with a wavelength greater than their characteristic 

transition (in this case 147.1 nm), they could be successfully excited if inside the Casimir 

cavity the (since the shift in the excited state would be greater than the shift in the ground 

state). Consecutively, when the atoms returned to the free space, they would emit their 

characteristic transition wavelength (in this case 147.1 nm), since the ZPF would re-

energised its ground and exited states back to the normal energies. In our system we made 

three spectral analyses (using the MC1) for three different excitation wavelength ranges. 

The photon intensity distribution of the excitation beam has a Gaussian form with centroid 

at the wavelength inserted in the MC2 controller and with the width defined by the MC2 

slits aperture. We regulated the entrance and exit slits of MC2 to 5.005 mm (the maximum 

slit aperture) since in this step it was required to irradiate as much as possible in 

wavelengths longer than 147.1 nm. The results for the three different irradiation 

wavelength ranges are shown in figures 37, 38 and 39. 

 

Figure 36: Spectrum recorded with MC1 when the main chamber was irradiated using 

photons with wavelength of 147.1 nm. The Al-coated membrane was inside the main chamber 

and Xe was flowing. The  differential pressure on both sides of the membrane was 

~0.35 ????; slits MC2 = 5005 ?m; slits MC1 = 2005 ?m; scan rate = 50 Å/min; MCA 

acquisition time = 2 s.

77 

 

In the first measurement, figure 37, the excitation wavelength centred on 250.2 nm 

is perfectly visible. To have a clear idea of the width of the excitation wavelength 

distribution we made a fit to the peak at 250.2 nm, figure 37. The adjusted function was 

a gauss superimposed on a linear background, being the FWHM = 13.5 nm. Although the 

FWHM would probably change with the wavelength we used this value (13.5 nm) to 

estimate where should be the next excitation wavelength centroid so that it could be 

possible to distinguish it from the Xe characteristic wavelength (147.1 nm). In the next 

measurements, figures 38 and 39, the excitation wavelength is not visible; this can be due 

to the lower light source intensity at this wavelength or to the membrane reflectivity for 

this wavelength, amongst other possibilities. Despite that this observation seems to 

suggest that for wavelengths shorter than ~250 nm our system doesn’t has enough 

luminosity or sensitivity; it may not be the case. In fact we may have the necessary 

condition but the Al-film can be reflecting more for longer wavelengths, because its 

reflectivity depends of the wavelength. However, as we’ve seen before in section 4.2.1 

this behaviour seems to be constant in this wavelength range. Still other factors can 

influence, such as the light reflected by the stainless steel chamber walls whose 

reflectivity will be different that the one of Al . In figures 38 and 39 it is also not visible 

the Xe characteristic transition wavelength (147.1 nm), as it was expected by this method. 

However, as we have demonstrated in the past, our instrumentation can detect radiation 

in these wavelengths, and therefore our results are not due to the sensitivity of our system. 

Anyway, the experimental work is at its very beginning and many studies are needed 

to understand our system and improve its performance, e.g. using a PMT with an MgF2 

window, reducing the PMT noise level, amongst other aspects. Nevertheless, under the 

present MSc work, we leave an experimental system fully operational.

7. Conclusions and future work 

In this document we tried to present a complete study regarding the energy extraction 

from the ZPF. This subject was treated with classic mechanics, specifically the SED since 

it is more intuitive for our proposals than QM. However we also introduced a possible 

interpretation of this subject in the QM realm, giving to the reader some references for a 

more detailed study.  

The SED was here introduced with focus on the H atom. Due to the gap in the 

literature concerning the behaviour of the atoms when immersed in a modified ZPF, we 

tried to create a model of this system by means of computational simulation. We then 

developed a code to simulate the motion of the electron in the H atom immersed in a one-

dimensional free space ZPF, and with it we were able to replicate some results of Cole et 

al [35] demonstrating that the electron radius distribution in the SED realm seems to 

converge to the one predicted by QM. We therefore validated our code, which will be 

important for future applications. One of these applications would be to simulate the H 

atom immersed in a cavity-modified ZPF. However, apart other problems with this 

algorithm, we concluded that the ZPF generation method is not trusty for the small cavity 

case. Therefore we generated a full 3D ZPF using two different methods, one of them 

was first presented in the bibliography [32], and the other developed by us. Both of these 

methods had success in the simulations related with the classic harmonic oscillator in the 

free space. However for the harmonic oscillator immersed in a cavity-modified ZPF only 

the method developed by us has shown coherent results. Thus, considering the 

approximation of two harmonic oscillators in quadrature for the electron orbit in the H 

atom, we used our method to estimate the averaged radius variation with the cavity-

modified ZPF. As initially suggested the ground state H atom will undergo a level shift 

when immersed in a cavity-modified ZPF. However we don’t take into account possible 

cavity-induced perturbations in the electron radiated power. Lastly we developed an 

algorithm to integrate the electron motion in time in a full 3D model of the H atom. This 

algorithm is similar to the previous; however significant improvements were made such 

as the inclusion of the ZPF magnetic part. Although this new method is a trustier 

description of the reality, our computational sources limited us so that we could not 

simulate the free space case or accumulate enough statistic for the cavity case. During 

these computational developments we also made some discovers important for future 



79 

 

improvements of the methods studied and developed in this work. In particular, we found 

that: the frequency window approximation seems to be not reliable for small boxes; the 

one-dimensional ZPF generation is ambiguous for the free space; and for small boxes it 

is more suitable to use the perfect box method for an accurate ZPF generation. 

After these extensive computational investigations we proceeded to the experimental 

investigation, giving first to the reader a clear scheme of our method to extract energy 

from the ZPF. We discussed some hypothesis and corresponding topologies to adopt in 

the experimental apparatus. However, we cannot directly apply our previous 

computational SED-related simulations in our experiment, since the simulations were 

only developed as a proof of concept. Finally we made some assumptions necessary to 

implement this theory in the real word.  

We projected and assembled an experimental apparatus capable of satisfying our 

conceptual ideas. Next we calibrated all the data acquisition instrumentation, developed 

software to analyse the data and made some tests which proven the functionality of our 

system. 

Finally, we were able to study some of the methods proposed and discussed in the 

chapter 4. For the ground state shifts of Xe, despite some strange results, we didn’t find 

any evidence of emitted radiation inside the main chamber. We essentially observed noise 

from the PMT + MC1 + data acquisition instrumentation. However, there could have been 

some radiation which was masked by the noise. Still, there is possibility that the radiation 

emitted is not in the studied ranges.  

For the two excited state type methods, we also could not detect any radiation in the 

expected wavelengths, however we suspect that our system has poor sensitivity in these 

wavelengths. In fact, we’ve also made some tests were we didn’t used Xe flowing or the 

membrane, only the two MC’s face to face in vacuum. We’ve irradiated the chamber with 

a wavelength of147.1 nm (selected by MC2) while scanning the wavelengths using MC1 

and failed to detect any radiation. We also noted that if we irradiated the PMT using 

longer wavelengths, as for example 155 nm, the detected light was so much that it 

saturates the PMT. Then, we conclude that our system is strongly limited in sensitivity 

for these wavelengths, principally by the PMT. 

It is also important to notice that, although our computational investigations and 

theoretical assumptions were made for the electromagnetic vacuum at zero temperature, 

our research was made at room temperature, so in fact we cannot distinguish the vacuum 

from the thermal electromagnetic fluctuations.   



80 

 

7.1.1. Future work 

First of all, an intensive theoretical investigation in the SED area, particularly for 

cavity enclosed atoms is needed. In the future we intend to make the same simulations 

we made here but with the inclusion of the modifications in the electron emitted power 

rate induced by the cavity boundaries. These simulations should be made using the real 

Coloumb potential and not the harmonic oscillator approximation. For that we intend to 

adapt our 3D H atom model to account for the cavity-modified damping constant. Hence, 

we need to run the code in a cluster, first for the free space in order to validate it, and then 

to run it for a small cavity. In the simulations area we also intend to continue the 

development of an algorithm (an adaptation of our 3D algorithm for the H atom) which 

accounts the atomic inner structure, in collaboration with Rodríguez.  

Our investigation is pioneer and consequently our experimental apparatus was the 

first attempt to investigate the theoretical hypothesis. Thus, after this investigation, we 

intend to make a lot of improvements in our apparatus. The most obvious is the need of a 

PMT more sensible in the region of the first resonance transitions of the heavier noble 

gases (100-160 nm would be enough [45]). Alternatively other atoms with less energetic 

atomic transitions could be used as for example carbon which has a transition of 193.1 

nm [52]. However, since these atoms don’t appear isolated in the nature we would have 

to use for example a molecular gas (as for example CF4) and dissociate them first, which 

is not difficult since the dissociation energies are usually less than the atomic energies. 

Therefore, the radiation wavelength inserted in the system will dissociate the molecules 

and also excite the resonance state. 

Other important improvement is to minimize the light wastes by optical means. In 

the present experiment the exit beam area was adjusted to illuminate all the membrane 

area and nothing more, however depending of the radiation wavelength and the gas type, 

part of the beam is absorbed in the gas. Then, and without changing the main chamber 

geometry, the gas pressure should be low enough to allow a good membrane irradiation. 

For this, we will study in the next step of our experience the gas transparency for the used 

wavelengths as a function of the pressure. We believe that, in the hypothesis which we 

irradiate the membrane with a wavelength equal to the gas resonance line, the light is 

strongly attenuated, so the gas pressure will be determinant to ensure the membrane 

irradiation. However when the atoms are excited for resonance states they will release by 

spontaneous emission the same wavelength isotropically, so this effect also plays an 

important role in the calculation of the membrane illuminance. To maximize the collected 



81 

 

light we intend to use a lens assembled inside the main chamber, close to the membrane 

gas outlet to focus the light emitted from this zone, in the MC1 entrance slit. 

A possible improvement would the use of porous-membranes integrally constructed 

of metal. This represents an improvement since the actual coated film depth also 

influences the efficiency of the cavity in suppressing the ZPF modes, being better for 

higher depths. However this kind of materials is harder to obtain than the ones we used. 

For future experiences with our experimental apparatus we intend to try others gases 

such as polyatomic gases. We expect that even vibrational molecular states will undergo 

level shifts when immersed in a modified ZPF, so instead of atomic transitions we can 

apply the same method for molecular gases where the energies to explore would be lower. 

As discussed in this work the dissociation and ionization energies can also undergo a level 

shift, so we intend to use in the future our equipment with other gases. Thus we can 

ionize/dissociate them before entering inside the cavity, where they recombine releasing 

a more energetic radiation that used to ionizing/dissociate them. In the case of using the 

molecular dissociation process, the energies used would also be lower (as the case of H2), 

which represents an advantage when using our PMT. 

Finally, we suggest a little test less dependent of the sensibility problems shown by 

our present system: the PMT can be directly assembled in the main chamber exit (where 

is now assembled the MC1 entrance), the main chamber entrance should be closed from 

any light source. Then, the Xe is made to flow through the Al-coated membrane at 

different rates, and perform acquisition of the PMT pulse counting, for each rate. Since 

for greater flows it is expected to have more atoms entering into the pores, the emitted 

radiation rate will also be greater. Without the MC1 and for a greater solid angle, the 

hypothetical collected radiation will be much more intense. This approach is similar to 

the one used in ref. [8] however, in our case, it will be for the UV-Visible range instead 

of IR range. 

 

 

 



82 

 

8. Annexes 

8.1. Spherical Method introduction 

In this section we will introduce what we called the “Spherical Method” to describe 

the ZPF. We will not explain the method or the algorithm in detail since it was already 

introduced and fully documented in other works [33][32]. 

This method produces a set of ? k-vectors so that the correspondent frequencies sit 

between two limits, ???? and ???? (the same frequency window, ??, we had introduced 

in the section 2.2.2). The frequency spacing is imposed by the ?? and ?. For each 

frequency a unique k-vector is generated with a random uniformly distributed direction. 

This k-vector and its random directions are easily generated using spherical coordinates. 

Consecutively each k-vector can take any direction from the referential origin to any point 

of a sphere surface associated with the k-vector correspondent frequency. 

For each k-vector 2 perpendicular vectors are also associated, they represent the two 

polarizations of the electric field. 2 random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 

2? are then generated for each of these polarizations. Except the volume ?, we have all 

the information needed to create a ZPF similar to the one described by equation 4. The 

magnetic component of the ZPF is generated from the electric one as mentioned before 

in section 2.2.1. 

The spherical method aims to generate an approximated ZPF inside a cubic box for 

that in the k-space the k-vectors are distributed in a perfect cubic mesh. However, as we 

saw the spherical method leads with random directions in spherical coordinates, thus the 

k-vectors don’t have information about the cubic grid characteristic of a cubic box. Other 

discrepancy between this method and the reality is the number of k-vectors for the same 

frequency. In this method there is only one k-vector to each frequency but in reality there 

could be much more (since in a centred cubic mesh there are a lot of symmetric points 

whose distance to the referential origin are the same).  Nevertheless it is claimed in ref. 

[32] that the spherical method is a good approximation when ? is great and ?? is small 

in such way the distribution of k-vectors is isotropic and similar to a spherical thin layer. 

If there are a lot of waves between near frequencies (as in a big V which is the free space 

approximation) then, as the k-vectors density in k-space is large, the information of the 



83 

 

box bounds is less important and the cubic grid disposition of the k-vectors becomes not 

important [32]. 

We have implemented this method developing a code in MATLAB to generate this 

ZPF. Making a simple representation, figure 37, of k-vectors for a big ? we visually 

testify the isotropy of the generated ZPF k-vectors. 

Finally, for a specific N and ?? it is possible to compute the correspondent ? [32] 

and thus include this value in the normalization factor (
1

??
). 

 

 

 

Figure 37: Three-dimensional representation of a set of k-vectors generated with the 

spherical method, all axis are in SI wavenumber units (??1). The ?? used is correspondent to 

the Bohr radius with ? = 400 (the f number will be introduced in section 3.3). ? = 10036 

which is equivalent to a box of  ? = 9 × 10?6 ?.  



84 

 

8.2. ??? computation with the Spherical Method 

In figure 38 we can see an example of a plot of the ???? computed by the Spherical 

Method and the theoretical curve of the ???? for the free space.  

As we can see there is an incredible coincidence of the computed values and the 

analytical function. Next a non-robust fit was done with equation 22 resulting in ? =

?4,5 ± 0,003 and ? = 2,65 × 10?54 ± 2,00 × 10?55 very concordant with analytic 

values (presented before in this section).  

Finally we can compute the ??? finding the point of the interception between the fitted 

???? and the theoretical ????  curve for the free space. In figure 39 we can see as an 

example this intersection for a box of ? = ~10 × 10?5 ?.  

 

Figure 38: Computed ???? for different random radius and the theoretical curve of ???? 

for the free space, as given by the equation 16. The computation of the ???? was performed 

with rs = 50,  ite = 2, f = 400, and ? = ~10 × 10?5 ? 

 



85 

 

From figure 10 we can see that the interception point is aproximatetly the Bohr 

radius, this shows the success of the method and validates the code and algorithm at least 

for free space.  

We then made the same simulation for a smaller box, with ? = ~5 × 10?6. The 

results are showed in figure 40. 

As we can see from figure 40 there is a strange split of ????. This fact can indicates 

a failure of this method (spherical method) when the box dimensions are small. This is 

very probable since this method is only applicable in the limit of a great number of waves 

for that the geometrical k-distribution in a cubic box is similar to the spherical k-

distribution generated in the Spherical Method.  

Figure 39: Fit of the computed ???? for different random radius and the theoretical curve 

of ????  to the free space. The ??? was found to be 5.2725 × 10
?11 ?. The computation of the 

???? was performed with rs = 50, int = 2, f = 400, and ? = ~10 × 10?5 ?.
