Acknowledgments 
 

I owe a great deal of thanks to many people who have made it possible for me to not only 
accomplish my research goals, but also to manage the task of living abroad in Brazil.  

I was first introduced to the subject of geophysics by Dr. James W. Rector at U.C. 
Berkeley, and I thank him for inspiring me to learn more about this unbelievable deep 
field of study. I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Renato L. Prado, for always being 
helpful and kind. His guidance allowed me to narrow my broad research interests and 
eventually focus on a topic suitable for a master’s degree. A special thanks to Dr. Choon 
Park for sharing his expertise and knowledge in using ParkSEIS© and in understanding 
the MASW method. I am thankful to Dr. Julian Ivanov and the staff at the Kansas 
Geological Survey for their help when I attended the SurfSeis© workshop in 2015. A 
word of gratitude to Rodrigo F. de Lucena for allowing me to use his dispersion function 
code, and for sharing his knowledge. Dr. Carlos A. Mendonça gave me the knowledge in 
the field of inversion to be able to create my own inversion code, for which I am very 
thankful. I am also thankful for Dr. Rodolfo M. Mendes sharing his geotechnical 
investigation for use in this research. I want to thank the faculty and staff at IAG-USP, 
who have always been very resourceful and helpful. In addition, I am very grateful to my 
friends and family who have always supported me and made me feel at home in São 
Paulo. 

It is common amongst physicists, scientists, and mathematicians to name theories with 
the name of the originator as a sign of respect (i.e. Rayleigh wave, Love wave, Jacobian 
matrix, etc.). However, it must be recognized that much of the accumulated knowledge in 
these fields has been passed down from countless individuals whom history has forgotten. 
Therefore, I would like to thank, more than any individual, the human spirit of curiosity 
and the desire to share new knowledge.

Abstract 
 

This study seeks to prove the usefulness of the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves 
(MASW) method as complementary data to conventional geotechnical and geological 
data in the characterization of areas of landslide risk.  The setting is located in a low 
income housing neighborhood in the city of Campos do Jordão, state of São Paulo, Brazil. 
The area was devastated by numerous landslides between December 1999 to January 
2000 after heavy rainfall in the area.  The landslides in this area are known to be shallow. 
Refraction and MASW surveys were performed in this research and then processed to 
obtain seismic velocity profiles of the subsurface. In order to better identify the 
fundamental mode of the Rayleigh wave, separate surveys isolating the vertical and radial 
components of the Rayleigh wave were performed. By comparing the inverted shear 
wave (??) and compressional wave (??) profiles with the already known geotechnical and 
geological data of the site, a better understanding of the geological interfaces that 
constitute the landslide prone area is obtained.

Resumo 
 

Este estudo busca demonstrar a aplicabilidade do método de análise multicanal de ondas 
superficiais (MASW) e a importância da integração de seus resultados com os da 
investigação geológica-geotécnica para a caracterização de áreas sujeitas a deslizamentos 
de terra. O local de estudo situa-se em uma área residencial com precárias condições de 
infraestrutura urbana na cidade de Campos do Jordão, estado de São Paulo, Brasil. Na 
área houve vários episódios de escorregamento entre dezembro de 1999 e janeiro de 2000 
após a ocorrência de chuvas intensas. Os escorregamentos nesta área são classificados 
como rasos. Nesta pesquisa foram realizados ensaios de sísmica de refração e MASW e 
gerados perfis e seções de velocidade de propagação das ondas sísmicas. Para obter uma 
melhor identificação do modo fundamental da onda Rayleigh foram realizadas diferentes 
aquisições visando ao registro das componentes vertical e radial do movimento da onda. 
A integração dos perfis de velocidades da onda cisalhante (VS) e da onda compressional 
(VP) com os dados geológicos e geotécnicos obtidos anteriormente permitiu aprimorar o 
mapeamento das interfaces geológicas importantes para o estudo dos processos de 
escorregamento do local.

Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 

Observing seismic waves traveling through the subsurface can provide important 
information for mapping the properties of shallow soils and sediments.  Because the 
properties of seismic waves are related to certain properties of the media through which 
the waves travel, these properties can be deduced from the observation and measurement 
of seismic wave propagation.  

In a region prone to shallow landslide danger, obtaining the properties of shallow soils 
and sediments can play an important role in understanding the subsurface and potentially 
helping to minimize risk to local inhabitants. There are many variables that may influence 
the occurrence of a landslide, such as meteorological variables (i.e. rain intensity, 
duration, etc.), geological variables (i.e. mineralogical composition, weathering, etc.), 
geotechnical variables (i.e. moisture content, water level, etc.), seismicity variables (i.e. 
soil stiffness, damping ratio, etc.), and human variables (i.e. poor standards of 
construction, man-made debris, etc.).  Some of these variables are directly and indirectly 
related, and many can belong to more than one category.   

Geotechnical drilling and lab testing can obtain near-surface soil and sediment properties.  
However, this practice is not only costly and time consuming but is limited to sampling 
very small sections as wide as the borehole and interpolating between them. For the cost 
of lower resolution, possible ambiguities of solution sets, and obtaining only a limited set 
of properties which can only indirectly relate to geological and geotechnical properties, 
geophysical methods offer the following advantages: (1) flexibility and high investigation 
speed, (2) non-invasive testing with the ability to determine the internal structure of the 
subsurface, (3) investigating a large volume of the subsurface, and (4) being relatively 
low-cost (Jongmans &amp;amp; Garambois, 2007). Although there exist various geophysical 
methods to obtain soil and sediment properties, seismic methods can nearly always 
determine the internal structure of materials in a slope; and furthermore, seismic 
refraction has been a standard tool for geotechnical investigations for many years (Hack, 
2000). There are many examples of seismic refraction being used in post-landslide 
reconnaissance investigations, as in Bogoslovsky et al. (1977), Caris et al. (1991), Godio 
et al. (2005), Glade et al. (2004), Spillmann et al. (2007), and Willenberg et al. (2008). In 
recent years, surface wave analysis has become a popular seismic method and is often 
used in combination with seismic refraction, as they can share the same geophone array 
(Havenith et al., 2000, Jongmans et al., 2009, Grandjean et al., 2011). Attempts at joint 
inversion of refraction and surface wave analysis have also been performed (Ivanov, 
2002). Investigations performed in landslide-prone areas using only surface wave 
analysis (Coccia et al., 2010) are also seen in the literature. 

However, many published studies using seismic techniques in landslide regions are 
typically located in non-tropical regions and often in mountainous alpine environments, 
where sharp velocity contrasts are common at the near surface. In contrast, in tropical 
regions intensive chemical weathering leads to the formation of a thick weathering crust 



Ch. 1 - Introduction

over the bedrock (Chamley, 1990). This thick layer of weathering crust can make near-
surface seismic investigations more difficult by reducing sharp contrasts in geological 
material at the near surface, and therefore sharp contrasts of seismic properties (i.e. 
stiffness, wave velocity). Since many seismic methods rely on the assumption that the 
subsurface is layered, this thick weathering crust may provide a challenge for reliable 
data processing and inversion.   

Furthermore, surface wave analysis for the purpose of near surface geotechnical 
investigation (i.e. shear wave velocity inversion) is currently under rapid evolution, as the 
method still suffers from some issues preventing reliable inversions for a variety of 
conditions (Socco et al. 2000).  

This study provides an opportunity to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of 
surface wave analysis techniques to determine the near surface seismic properties of a 
tropical region prone to shallow landslides and to discuss ideas to improve these near 
surface seismic methods.   

 

1.1 Motives 
 

This research seeks to contribute to the problem of understanding the subsurface of 
terrain prone to shallow landslides and to understand the potential contribution of the 
multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method to this end. Furthermore, the 
importance of a-priori information in the MASW inversion process is also studied to 
investigate the viability of the current MASW inversion methods, by means of 
commercial software SurfSeis?, and ParkSEIS?.  

It is hoped that this research will help develop, promote, and understand geophysical 
techniques that can aid geotechnical engineers in various engineering problems that 
require an understanding of the subsurface. It is the opinion of the author that advances in 
near surface geophysical techniques may revolutionize the practice of geotechnical site 
investigations. By giving the engineer more tools to measure the subsurface we can 
expect a greater degree of accuracy in the assessment of vital geotechnical parameters, 
which can be of immense importance in various engineering projects.  

1.2 Objectives 
 

The primary objective of this study is to test the multichannel analysis of surface waves 
(MASW) (Park et al., 1999) method in an environment that challenges the underlying 
assumptions of the method. The study site is located in a mountainous tropical 
environment with challenging topography and a very thick weathered layer (residual soil 
and saprolite).  

We can consider the secondary objective to be the exploration of MASW inversion 
results when considering a-priori data. In this study a-priori data is assumed from existing 



Ch. 1 - Introduction

geotechnical and geological data as well as other seismic methods performed on site 
(Seismic Refraction, Love Wave, and Passive MASW surveys).  

The key deliverable of this project is the near-surface shear wave velocity profile of the 
study site.  

 

1.3 Approach 
 

As explained in section 1.1, the MASW method is the focus of this study.  

The general approach of this study can be divided into the following steps: 

? Gather all relevant geotechnical and geological data available for the site and 
surrounding region. 

? Perform refraction and surface wave investigations at the site.  
? Process refraction and surface wave (excluding the active MASW survey) data 

separately, and verify consistency.  
? Develop an a-priori model with a combination of geotechnical/geological data and 

seismic inversion (excluding the active MASW survey) results.  
? Invert MASW (Rayleigh wave) data both considering a-priori data and not, and 

compare results.

Chapter 2 - Theoretical Background 
 

2.1 Historical Overview of the Development of Near-
Surface Seismic Methods 
 

In the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the first seismic exploration methods were 
developed from early earthquake studies. 1846 saw Robert Mallet be the first man to use 
an “artificial” energy source in a seismic experiment; he also became the first man to use 
the term “seismology”.  August Schmidt created the travel time-distance graph in 1888 
for the determination of seismic velocities; this graph is fundamental to many modern 
seismic methods.  G.K. Knott explained the phenomenon of seismic propagation, 
refraction, and reflection in 1899.  The combination of two world wars, a boom in the oil 
&amp;amp; gas industry, and the invention of the computer made the twentieth century an 
exceptional period of growth for applied seismology.  By the 1920s seismic reflection 
had become widely used for the exploration of hydrocarbons and soon became the 
dominant method for the exploration of oil and gas throughout the world.  Seismic 
refraction methods were also being developed with the invention of the ‘Plus-Minus’ 
method by J.G. Hagedoorn in 1959 and the ‘reciprocal method’ by L.V. Hawkins in 1961.  
R. Jones was among the first to propose engineering applications in surface-wave 
analysis (Jones, 1958, 1962).  Soon a new method, named the spectral analysis of surface 
waves (SASW) (Nazarian &amp;amp; Stokoe, 1984), made surface-wave analysis popular among 
the engineering community, and is still popular to the present day (Socco, Foti, &amp;amp; Boiero, 
2010).  And more recently, the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method, 
developed by researchers from the Kansas Geological Survey (Park et al., 1999), has 
become a popular way to analyze surface waves while using the same survey 
configuration of a common refraction survey. Much of the historical information 
provided in this paragraph is based on (Reynolds, 2011).   

Modern applied seismology is divided into three branches: refraction, reflection, and 
surface wave analysis.  Reflection analysis is the most powerful method for oil 
exploration due to its ability to image deep structures.  Refraction and surface wave 
analysis, however, have been consistently used for near surface applications useful to 
engineers interested in the shallow subsurface. These are the two methods used in this 
study.    

   

2.2 Surface Waves in an Infinite-Elastic-Isotropic-
Homogeneous Half-Space 
 

This section reviews the most common derivation of Rayleigh waves seen in many 
seismology textbooks (Aki &amp;amp; Richards, 1980; Chapman, 2004; Lay &amp;amp; Wallace, 1995; 



Ch. 2 – Theoretical Background

Shearer, 2009; Stein, 2009; Udías, 1999). The Rayleigh wave derivation presented in this 
section is mostly influenced by Kramer (2002). Assuming a homogeneous half space 
with no layering greatly simplifies the Rayleigh wave problem, but it is important to note 
that although many characteristics are shared between Rayleigh waves in homogeneous 
media and layered media, there are also some major differences such as normal modes 
and dispersion. Definitions of elastic moduli and related terms can be found in Appendix 
A. 

 

2.2.1 The Rayleigh wave  
 

There is only one kind of surface wave that can exist in an infinite-elastic-isotropic-
homogeneous half-space, the Rayleigh Wave. Let us assume a two-dimensional space 
where ? is the vertical axis and ? is the horizontal axis.   

Let us define horizontal displacement (??) and vertical displacement (??) as the 
following differential equations,   

                                                          ?? =
??

??

??

??
                                (2.1) 

                                                          ?? =
??

??
?

??

??
                      (2.2) 

 

Now we must define the harmonic (or potential) functions ?  and ? . In order to do this, 
we must introduce the wave equation for a two dimensional elastic solid, and then we can 
define volumetric strain and rotational strain in terms of ?  and ? . 

Introducing the wave equations for two-dimensions (?,?) in terms of stress, 

?

????

??

????

?
????

???

Now we can write the two wave equations in terms of strain by using Hooke’s law, 

?
????

??

?
????

???

???

??

Now let us define volumetric strain and rotational strain in terms of ?  and ? ,

?

??
?
??

??
?

??

??
? =

???

???

???

???
   = ???   

 

Now we can write the two wave equations in terms of ?  and ?  by using the definition ?? 
and ?? from Equations 2.1 and 2.2, 

?
?

??
?

Now we can simultaneously solve these two wave equations to obtain, 

???

???

????

?
??? = ??

????   

???

???

?

?
??? = ???

? ???   

 

Assuming that the wave is harmonic and propagates with the Rayleigh wave velocity, we 
can express ?  and ?  as, 

? = F(z)??(??????)  

? = G(z)??(??????)  

 

where the functions F(z) and G(z) describe the variation of volumetric strain and 
rotational strain with depth.

Inserting these two harmonic functions into the solutions to the wave equations yields, 

?
??

??
? ?(?)= ???

??(?)+
???(?)

???
  

?
??

???
? ?(?)= ???

??(?)+

???
  

 

and rearranging these two equations gives, 

???

???
? ???

? ?
??

??
??? = 0  

???

???
? ???

? ?
??

???
? ?? = 0  

 

The general solution of these two equations is as follows,  

?(?)= ???
??? + ???

?? 

?(?)= ???
??? + ???

?? 

 

where the arbitrary constants ? and ? are defined as,  

 

? = ???
? ?

??

??
?   

? = ???
? ?

??

???
?

We can see that the general solution contains a linear combination of two types of 
exponentials. 

 

             Contribution of ??and ??                             Contribution of ?? and ??   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is unrealistic for the amplitude of displacement to increase to infinity with depth, and 
therefore we can assume the terms of ??and ?? to be 0. Another way to think of this is 
that ??and ?? represent the amplitudes of the upward going reflected waves from an 
interface. However, since we are assuming an infinite isotropic medium, there are no 
interfaces, and therefore these terms must be 0. 

Therefore,  

?(?)= ???
??? 

?(?)= ???
??? 

 

and now the harmonic functions ?  and ?  can be defined as,  

                                                        ? = ???
?????(??????)          (2.3) 

                                                        ? = ???
?????(??????)         (2.4) 

 

We now have two equations and three unknowns (??,??,??). We can eliminate ?? by 
introducing the boundary condition that neither shear nor normal stress can exist at the 
free surface (? = 0). 

??(???) = ??? + 2??? = ??? + 2?
???

??
= 0  

???(???) = ???? = ? ?
???

??

???

??
? = 0

On the left is plotted x=exp(z), and on the right x=exp(-z), keep in mind that z is positive in the down direction.

We can rewrite these boundary conditions using the definitions of ?? and ?? in terms of 
the harmonic functions ?  and ?  given in Equations 2.1 and 2.2 and the general solutions 
to ?  and ?  given by Equations 2.3 and 2.4 as, 

??(???) = ??[(? + 2?)?
? ? ???

?] ? 2??????? = 0  

???(???) = 2?????? + ??(?
? + ??

?)= 0  

 

Now we can define ?? in terms of ??, 

?? = ?
???????

?????
?   

 

 and finally the “solvable” harmonic functions ?  and ?  can be expressed as, 

                                                        ? = ???
?????(??????)         (2.5) 

                                                        ? = ?

where, 

?? ?
(????)??????

?

??????

?????

?????
?? = 0  

 

Now we can define the distribution of the amplitude of displacement due to a Rayleigh 
Wave. 

By using the definition of the harmonic functions ?  and ? , we can write the horizontal 
displacement (??) and vertical displacement (??) as the following,   

                                     ?? = ?? ??????
??? +

?????

??????(??????)                  (2.7)

????

?

?????
? ?

??? ? ????????(??????)        (2.8) 

 

And finally we can define the Rayleigh wave velocity by equating the boundary 
conditions, which gives us,

? = (?? + ??

?)[(? + 2?)?? ? ???
?]

By applying the definitions of ? and ? and factoring out ????

Let us now rewrite this equation in terms of the Rayleigh-wave to S-Wave and P-Wave

We are now able to find the displacement and velocity of any particle influenced by a 
Rayleigh wave in an infinite-elastic-isotropic-homogeneous half-space. 

The following is a list of the implications of this Rayleigh wave solution: 

? The Rayleigh wave is really a grouping of P and SV waves near the surface. 
? Rayleigh wave velocity is very close to the S wave velocity and varies with the 

Poisson’s ratio. 
? Vertical displacement is 90? off-phase with the horizontal (or radial) displacement. 
? Particle Motion is elliptical. 
? Particle motion is purely vertical at a certain depth (0.19?) and ellipticity varies 

with depth. 
? Horizontal and vertical displacement have different amplitudes with depth, and 

the amplitudes vary with the Poisson ratio. 
? The stress profile explains the unique profiles of the vertical and horizontal 

displacement amplitudes.

2.3 Surface Waves in a Layered-Infinite-Elastic-Laterally 
Isotropic/Homogeneous Half-Space  
 

The introduction of layers introduces three important phenomena, Love waves, normal 
modes, and dispersion.  We will begin this section by reviewing normal mode theory by 
using the wave solution to a finite elastic rote fixed at both ends. Next the Love wave 
problem is solved for the simplest two-layer model. And finally, a very brief overview of 
the Rayleigh wave solution is given as a detailed derivation will be quite lengthy and not 
necessary for much of the dispersive and modal characteristics are very similar to the 
Love wave solution. In practice, a layered homogeneous elastic model is a useful 
approximation for many near-surface situations (Xu et al., 2006).  

 

2.3.1 Normal Mode Theory  
 

When elastic waves propagate in a medium with infinite dimensions there exist no modes, 
and when elastic waves propagate in a medium with finite dimensions, there exist an 
infinite number of modes. By introducing layers, we effectively create a finite dimension 
space, and therefore an infinite number of modes.  

Let us understand normal mode theory by analyzing vibrations in a finite elastic rod 
(adapted from Udías, 1999).

Consider a finite isotropic-elastic rod where there only exist longitudinal displacements. 

?? = ???????????? ??????????? 

?? = ?????? ???????????? ??? ??? ?????? ? = 0 

 

The normal stress in the longitudinal direction can be written as, 

?? = (? + 2?)
???

??
  

 

We can write the wave equation (in the absence of forces) as, 

????

???
=

?

??
?

????

???
  

 

where,  

??
? =

(????)

?
  

 

The general solution to this wave equation can be written as,  

?? = ????(??)cos (?? + ?)  

 

where ? is the initial phase. The boundary conditions (both ends fixed) are defined as, 

??(0,?)= 0 

??(?,?)= 0 

 

and therefore, 

????(??)= 0, ?? = (? + 1)?, ??? ? = 0,1,2,3…,?  

 

and finally the solution (for a given mode) is, 

??
?(?,?)= ??????

(???)??

?
????(??? + ??)

where, 

?? =

?
,??? ? = 0,1,2,3…,?  

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

When n is equal to 0, this is known as the fundamental mode, and “higher modes” are 
defined for n larger than 0. The displacement due to wave motion is now the sum of all 
the modes. Although the wave equation here is unique to an isotropic-elastic rod, this 
modal behavior is also seen in surface waves that exist in bounded media.  

 

2.3.2 The Love wave  
 

Love waves only exist in layered media, as they essentially consist of SH-waves that are 
trapped by multiple reflections within layers, where the largest amplitudes exist at the 
surface. In a two-layer model, Love waves can only occur if the surface layer has a lower 
velocity than the half space. This section is a review of the Love wave solution for a 
simple two-layer model.

We can define the Love wave displacement for a wave propagating as,

propagating in the x and z directions for each layer.

where ?? and ?? are defined as, 

?? = ???

?? = ???

??

????

?? must be 0 since the half space is infinite and there cannot be an up going wave.

Now let us introduce the boundary conditions. We have the following two boundary 
conditions, 

?? ??? ??????? (? = 0)
      ?? ???????? ????? (? = ?)

????? ?????? ?? ????????????

 

 

which can be expressed as,

??
??(?????) = ??????

???? + ?????
??? = (?? ? ??)??(?

???? + ????)= 0

?? = 0
 

 

This implies that ?? = ??

???
????                       ??? 0 ? ? (???? ? ?????) 

  

 

We can consider two more boundary conditions, 

?? ??? ????? ????????? (? = ?)?
????? ?????? ?? ????? ?? ???? ??????
???????????? ?? ????? ?? ???? ??????

This equation gives us the transverse displacement (??) caused by the Love wave for 

each mode ?. You can think of this equation as an eigenvalue problem and in order to 
solve it we must find the eigenvalues (??) for each mode ? for a given angular frequency 
? and once we plug this back into the Eigen functions (Equation 2.10 for each mode ?) 
we obtain a displacement to depth profile for each mode at a particular frequency like in 
the example shown below in Figure 2.13.

In order to find the eigenvalues (??) for each mode ? we can use the following

This is known as the Love-Wave Dispersion Function. 

 

We can see from this equation that only the fundamental mode (? = 0) contains 
velocities at all frequencies. We call the lowest frequency that a higher mode (? =
1,2,3…?) can exist its cutoff frequency. The cutoff frequency for each higher mode can 
be found using the following relationship,

higher frequencies have more modes, and subsequently more roots (or solutions) to the

2.3.3 The Rayleigh wave  
 

In the previous section the Love wave problem was solved for a simple two-layer model.  
However, to solve even a simple two-layer Rayleigh wave problem considerably more 
effort is involved. Because Love wave dispersion and modal behavior is very similar to 
that of Rayleigh waves and as the purpose of this section is to demonstrate the dispersive 
and modal characteristics of Rayleigh waves in layered media, the majority of the 
derivation will be bypassed and rather the most important characteristics of Rayleigh 
waves in layered media will be discussed. 

The Rayleigh eigenvalue problem is more complicated to solve because it involves both 
P and SV waves, which are the two waves that essentially constitute a Rayleigh wave.  
The most common way to solve it is by the transfer matrix method, after Thomson (1950) 
and Haskel (1953) (Pei, 2007). However, there are other alternative matrix methods such 
as the stiffness matrix method after Kausel and Roesset (1981) and the reflection-
transmission coefficient matrix method after Kennet (1984) and Luco and Aspel (1983). 
Numerical methods such as finite-element method (Lysmer and Drake, 1972), finite-
difference method (Boore, 1972), and numerical integral method (Takeuchi and Saito, 
1972) can also solve the Rayleigh eigenvalue problem (Pei, 2007). A detailed derivation 
of the Rayleigh wave problem can be found in many seismology textbooks such Aki &amp;amp; 
Richards (1980).

We cannot ignore ??because it represents a reflected wave traveling upward, and we can 
only ignore ?? when it is representing the half-space.  Also we will have to solve these 
equations at each layer interface, so we will re-write it in a form per layer.

Let us consider the following boundary conditions, 

1) Stresses ?? and ??? are zero at the surface. 
2) Displacements ?? and ?? are zero at infinite depth. 

3) Stresses ?? and ??? are the same for both layers at at an interface. 
4) Displacements ?? and ?? are the same for both layers at an interface.

We can now develop these vectors into a matrix eigenvalue problem, and eventually find 
the values to ??, ??, ??, ?? and consequently the displacements and velocities for each 
layer. And we see the similar dispersive and modal behavior as seen in Love waves.

2.4 Seismic Methods  
 

2.4.1 Refraction WET Tomography 
 

The foundations of the general theory of tomography can be found in work of J. Radon 
(1917) and applied by A. Cormack in 1963 (Udías, 1999), and has since been used in 
many fields. Seismic tomography applied to study the Earth’s interior was developed in 
the mid-1970s (aki et al., 1976, apud Udías, 1999). Refraction tomography techniques are 
essentially travel time tomography methods applied to refracted waves. As with the finite 
element method, tomography separates a region into blocks or sub-regions, and in the 
case of travel time tomography the residual (or difference) of the observed and modeled 
wave arrival times at each sub-region is the object of the inversion process. Since 
observed data is typically only available on the surface, the aim of travel time 
tomography is to explain the residuals (or incoherence between the model and observed 
data) through velocity distribution inside the earth, where a higher concentration of ray 
paths adds more confidence. 

Figure 2.19 – Rayleigh wave dispersion curves for the fundamental mode 
(????? ?? ???) and three higher modes. The vertical axis is the Rayleigh wave 
phase velocity (??) and the horizontal axis is frequency. The ranges for the SV wave 
velocity (????? ?? ?) and the Rayleigh wave phase velocity (????? ?? ??) are 
shown. The cutoff frequencies are also shown as ???,???,???. From Udías, 1999. 



Ch. 2 – Theoretical Background 
 

 
25 

Figure 2.21 – A schematic representation of a 
Fresnel volume with a source (S) and a receiver 
(R), from Watanabe, 1999. 

Refraction tomography is based on an iterative process. First an initial model of seismic 
velocities is generated in accordance with the source/geophone arrangement employed to 
record the refracted waves. Subsequently, an inversion algorithm seeks to minimize the 
difference of the residuals by making adjustments to the model until a solution is found, 
be it local or global. 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Refraction tomography is not subject to the same constraints imposed by the simplifying 
assumptions of conventional refraction methods such as the delay time and generalized 
reciprocal methods; refraction tomography performs well in many situations where 
conventional methods fail, e.g., where lateral or vertical gradients compose a significant 
component of the velocity structure (Sheehan et al., 2005).

study of seismic tomography of the earth. Residuals 
are only obtainable between ray paths, so outside 
points are not invertible. From Udías, 1999. 



Ch. 2 – Theoretical Background 
 

 
26 

In this research Rayfract? is used as the software for processing refraction data. 
Rayfract? employs the wavepath eikonal  travel time inversion method (WET) (Schuster 
&amp;amp; Quintus-Bosz, 1993) by calculating the travel times from the finite difference of the 
eikonal first order equation proposed by Lecomte et al. (2000) and using the Fresnel 
volume approach proposed by Watanabe et al. (1999). A Fresnel volume considers not 
only the ray path as influencing the seismic signal recorded by a geophone but also takes 
into account the structure around the ray path. For this work, Rayfract’s “smooth 
inversion” algorithm is used for all WET tomography inversions; this algorithm creates a 
one dimensional initial model based on the Delta-t-V (Rohdewald, n.d.) inversion results 
and smooths it to remove artifacts (Sheehan et al., 2005).  

 

2.4.1.1 Field Measurements 
 

Refraction data is typically collected by a linear spread of geophones on the earth surface 
recording seismic data originating from an active source (in the case of this research, a 
sledgehammer). In order to obtain the maximum amount of information from a survey it 
is necessary to collect data from a variety of shot (or source) locations. Rayfract® 
recommends at least one shot per every sixth receiver in an array for a reliable WET 
tomography inversion.

sledgehammer as an active source. Note that not all refraction interpretation methods required 
idealized flat layering as shown. 



Ch. 2 – Theoretical Background 
 

 
27 

2.4.2 MASW  
 

The multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method, first introduced by Park et 
al. (1999), is a seismic method which exploits the dispersive nature of Rayleigh waves (in 
layered media) to invert a one-dimensional model of the earth (that can be interpolated 
into a two-dimensional profile) in terms of the P wave velocity, SV wave velocity, 
density, and thickness of each layer.  The MASW method is most commonly used with a 
linear geophone array, as shown in Figure 2.23, with an active source such as a 
sledgehammer. However, roadside and passive MASW surveys are also common, where 
a two-dimensional array is preferable for passive surveys to accurately locate the source 
azimuth. And although MASW is typically used to record the more energetic vertical 
component of the Rayleigh wave, it can be equally effective in measuring the horizontal 
(or radial) component, which may be useful in further defining the fundamental or higher 
modes. It is also important to note that there exist a variety of ways to analyze surface 
waves by measuring seismic wave arrivals using an array of geophones, and therefore the 
term MASW will be used exclusively in referring to the general procedure of Rayleigh 
wave analysis used by Park et al. (1999) and implemented by the commercial software 
packages SurfSeis? v.4 and ParkSEIS? v.1.

that Rayleigh waves in layered media will exhibit dispersive and modal behavior, and that the Rayleigh 
wave amplitudes are not to scale, and will vary with different site characteristics.

2.4.2.1 Field Measurements 
 

The first step to the MASW method is the field survey. There are a couple of key 
parameters to consider. 

? Geophone Type 
? Number of Geophones 
? Geophones Spacing 
? Array Length 
? Source Offset 
? Source Type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



Ch. 2 – Theoretical Background 
 

 
29 

Geophone Type:  

Geophones manufactured with a lower natural frequency have the advantage of 
effectively recording lower frequency components of surface waves, however geophones 
are not limited by their natural frequency and many observations have been made of 
frequencies as low as 5 Hz for 10-Hz geophones and down to 10 Hz for 40 Hz geophones 
(Park et al., 2002). The lower the seismic velocity of the material (i.e. the softness), the 
more important it is to have a lower frequency geophone (see Table 2.1).  Typically, 
geophones with natural frequencies lower than 4.5 Hz are not used, as costs tend to 
increase exponentially for geophones with natural frequencies lower than the relatively 
common 4.5 Hz. 

Number of Geophones: 

In a two station (or geophone) survey (i.e. SASW) the geophone spacing determines both 
the maximum recordable wavelength and the minimum recordable wavelength; in other 
words, two station surveys can record only one wavelength. With the multichannel 
approach (MASW), there are a variety of recordable wavelengths as there are a variety of 
geophone distances to consider. The larger the number of geophones the larger the 
variety of recordable wavelengths. However, a higher number of geophones alone does 
not increase the resolution of the dispersion image; this is only achieved by a longer array 
length (or spread length), which may or may not include more geophones (Park et al., 
2001).   Ultimately, the chosen geophone spacing and array length are what should 
determine the number of geophones. 

Geophone Spacing: 

Because MASW survey arrays typically have evenly spaced geophones, the spacing 
between each geophone essentially determines the minimum recordable wavelength and 
therefore the minimum invertible depth. Typical values recommended by the KGS range 
anywhere between 0.25 m for very shallow surveys and up to 5 m for deeper surveys 
(Table 2.1).  

Array Length: 

The length of the array determines the largest recordable wavelength of the survey, and 
consequently the depth of investigation. Furthermore, the resolution of a dispersion 
image at a given frequency is directly proportional to the product of the length of the 
geophone array and the frequency (Xia et al., 2005). However, the longer the array length, 
the greater the area that is assumed to be laterally homogeneous (this is due to the 
fundamental assumption of the two-dimensional Rayleigh wave forward modeling 
schemes that assume a layered medium). Therefore, if a site is known to vary laterally a 
long array is not recommended, however the maximum depth will be sacrificed with 
shorter array lengths.

Figure 2.25 - A dispersion image illustrating the phase velocity resolution (??), from Xia 
et al., 2005. 

The dispersion image resolution is given by the following equation (Xia et al., 2005), 

?? = 1/(? × ??) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Source Offset: 

Rayleigh waves require a certain distance to form; this is because a Rayleigh wave is 
essentially a grouping of P and SV waves that form as a results of interactions at the 
surface interface. The nearest offset from a source that is sufficiently far away to where a 
Rayleigh wave can be generated in a simplified two-layered model is given by Equation 
2.13 (Xia et al., 2005).   

                                                 ??(???) =
??

??
??

???
? ?

?
??

                                                (2.13) 

This equation clearly shows how the distance to which a Rayleigh wave is generated is 
related to not just the velocities of the first layer (?? &amp;amp; ???) but also the thickness (?) of 
the first layer. If we assume that ??/?? is equal to 4, then we see that the minimum offset 
is about h/2 or 50% of the depth to the half-space (or maximum depth of investigation). 
This is a good rule of thumb to consider when determining the minimum source offset, 
and although Equation 2.13 is based on a two-layer model, it is also valid for a multi-
layer model because the reflected P wave energy from the interface of the first two layers 
always interferes with the direct S wave energy first (Xu et al., 2006).

frequencies after a certain distance. Modified from the short

Park et al. (1999) defines the near-field effects as the effects which do not allow Rayleigh 
waves to travel as horizontal plane waves near the source; and likewise, the far-field 
effects are defined as the rapid attenuation of high frequency surface wave energy with 
distance (see Figure 2.26), eventually allowing body wave energy to dominate. The 
recommended best practice is to pick a source offset range that is greater than the 
minimum offset (i.e. approximately 0.5 × ???? in most cases) and is not too long that 
will cause far-field effects; the recommended source offsets in Table 1 can be used to 
avoid far-field effects in most conditions.  

 

 



Ch. 2 – Theoretical Background 
 

 
32 

Source Type: 

There are a variety of sources available to process surface wave data. In general, sources 
can be divided into passive and active, where passive sources derive from events which 
induce ground vibrations that are not purposely intended for the survey, and active 
sources are sources of energy which originate from a purposeful release of energy into 
the ground to induce vibration. Typical examples of passive sources include vehicle 
traffic, construction work, ocean waves, etc., and typical examples of active sources 
include sledgehammer impacts, explosion charges, weight drops, etc.  Sledgehammer 
sources are perhaps the most common type of active source due to the relative ease and 
cost of use. Park et al. (2002) showed that although a 20-lb sledgehammer source 
obtained slightly lower frequency surface wave energy as compared to a 10-lb 
sledgehammer, a rubber-band-aided weight drop with more impact energy actually 
increased the higher frequency surface wave energy at a particular site. Thus, an increase 
of impact strength does not necessarily increase the amount of surface wave energy at 
lower frequencies (Park et al., 2002).  

 

 

 

2.4.2.2 Data Processing 
 

Before the conversion of multichannel records into dispersion images (through slant-
stack processing) we can improve the seismic data by muting, automatic gain control, 
and/or filtering (Yilmaz, 2001). MASW data processing is essentially the conversion of 
seismic multichannel records (or seismograms) into dispersion images (or overtones). 
There exist a variety of methods to perform this conversion, such as the pi-omega 
transformation (McMechan and Yedlin, 1981). However, MASW implements the phase-
shift method (Park et al., 1998), which achieves a higher resolution that the pi-omega 
method (Park et al. 1998).

2.4.2.3 Curve Picking 
 

The next step is to use the dispersion image to accurately find and select points that lie on 
the dispersion curve of the fundamental mode (and possibly higher modes) of the 
Rayleigh wave.   

This is perhaps the most controversial aspect of MASW as it introduces unquantifiable 
human error into the process. An experienced user of the MASW method will recognize 
certain patterns in the dispersion images and with time confidence can build in the curve 
selection process, however the biggest challenge is the unpredictable site response. It has 
become evident through modeling that the fundamental mode is not necessarily the 
dominating mode and the continuity of a signal in the dispersion image does not 
necessary mean that it belongs to a single mode (Moro, 2015).

and dispersion image that is an output of MASW data processing, from Park,

2.4.2.4 Inversion 
 

The forward modeling algorithms for both SurfSeis? and ParkSEIS? are based on 
Schwab and Knopoff (1972), which itself is based on the transfer matrix method of 
Thomson (1950) and Haskell (1953). Although SurfSeis? is capable of multi-mode 
inversion, it is typically used for fundamental mode inversion as energy is usually 
concentrated in that mode, making it easier to pick. Furthermore, the fundamental mode 
always has the lowest Rayleigh wave phase velocities and is the only mode to exist at all 
frequencies, distinguishing it even further from the other modes.  

The inversion algorithms differ between SurfSeis? and ParkSEIS?. The algorithm for 
SurfSeis? is based on Xia et al. (1999) whereas the ParkSEIS? algorithm has not been 
published. Both software packages allow the user to modify certain settings in the 
inversion process, but neither allow modifications to the objective function.   

The MATLAB® code written for this research performs inversion using MATLAB’s 
built in minimizer functions such as fmincon and fminsearch. In this code, the objective 
function is defined as the Euclidian distance between the picked dispersion curve and a 
dispersion curve that varies with each iteration as parameters are adjusted until a 
minimum is reached.

inversion. Note that here only the fundamental mode has been picked and used for inversion, from Park et al., 2004.

2.4.3 Love Wave Analysis 
 

The multichannel analysis of love waves is essentially equivalent to the MASW method 
that is used for Rayleigh waves. However, presumably because SH wave generation is 
more difficult and SH refraction surveys seldom performed, neither SurfSeis© nor 
ParkSEIS© contain the forward modeling algorithm (also found in Schwab and Knopoff, 
1972) for Love waves, and therefor are incapable of inverting for them. However, 
theoretically these two software packages are useful up until the inversion process (i.e. 
extracting a dispersion image from a multichannel record and picking the fundamental 
dispersion curve). Once a dispersion curve has been picked from a Love wave dispersion 
image, it can be inverted in an inversion algorithm that can be implemented in any 
computer language. The author has created a MATLAB® code which can invert Love 
wave fundamental mode dispersion curves as well as that of the Rayleigh wave for 
simplified two-dimensional layered homogeneous isotropic models.

Chapter 3 - Area of Study 
 

In the large scale, the area of study is situated on the Campos do Jordão plateau, a high 
elevation land mass located near the southeastern border of the Mantiqueira mountain 
range (Serra da Mantiqueira), Brazil. The Mantiqueira mountain range reaches a 
maximum elevation of 2,798 meters at Pedra da Mina peak, however the immediate 
region of the site of investigation averages around 1,700 meters in elevation.   

 

 

Figure 3.1 – Visualization of the area of study using data from a digital elevation model via NASA Shuttle Radar 
Topography Mission Global 30m (SRTM_GL1). 

 

In the medium scale, the area of study is located in the low income housing neighborhood 
of Santo Antônio, a part of the city of Campos do Jordão in the state of São Paulo. The 
neighborhood has seen a sharp rise in the number of inhabitants and homes since the 
1970s (see Figure 3.2, right side) as the region has developed into a popular tourist 
destination for Brazilians. Despite very expensive housing development in large parts of 
the city, the population found in this neighborhood is predominantly low income and live 
in poor housing conditions, which is typically a result of initially unauthorized land use 
which was later legalized by the government. As a result, the steep terrain is improperly 
occupied, where cuts and landfills are often carried out by the residents themselves, often 
resulting in precarious and dangerous slope stability issues (Ahrendt, 2005).

In the small scale, the area of study is located to the far west side of Santo Antônio, 
between a building which is currently managed by a local university and a caged weather 
monitoring station used previously by the Geological Institute (IG) of the state of São 
Paulo. The site was chosen because it sits on a relatively stable slope for the safety of 
personnel, and because it shares many geological characteristics with nearby areas where 
landslides have previously occurred. Due to these characteristics, a geotechnical 
investigation was conducted at the site by Mendes et al. (2015). The site is located less 
than 200 meters from an area known to have suffered from landslides during the region’s 
infamous landslide event of the 1999-2000 winter.

3.1 Landslide History and Data  
 

Santo Antônio and nearby neighborhoods were devastated after widespread landslides 
destroyed many homes between December 1999 and January 2000 after heavy rainstorms 
hit the region. The disaster became the focus of many research efforts afterwards 
(Ahrendt, 2005; Mendes 2012; Mendes et al., 2015). These research efforts have resulted 
in some valuable information, however a detailed near surface velocity profile has yet to 
be available. The landslides which occurred during this event were very shallow, 
generally being less than a meter deep (Ahrendt, 2005).

The Mantiqueira mountain range is geologically old, dating to the Precambrian and the 
Paleozoic (Modenesi et al., 2010). The predominant geology of Campos do Jordão 
includes metamorphic rocks such as migmatites, gneisses, metadiorite, and granulites; 
and there also occur schists, quartzites, and metaconglomerates in the form of lenses and 
some magmatic intrusions; locally there occur migmatites with alternating bands of 
neosome (the newly formed metamorphic parts of the migmatites) and paleosome (parts 
of the migmatites made of the original igneous rock) (Ahrendt, 2005). The secondary 
minerals include oxides and hydroxides of aluminum and iron along with clay minerals 
(Ahrendt, 2005). 

A geological investigation of the Campos do Jordao plateau at various points between 2-5 
km south-east of the study site performed by Modenesi et al. (2010) reveals depths to 
bedrock (composed of banded gneisses and granitic rock) between 30-50 meters. The 
depth profiles are a results of drilling performed for the study and they also show water 
levels between 23 to 37 meters deep. The study also reveals a very thick layer of 
weathered saprolite over the bedrock (up to 50 meters deep), largely composed of 
kaolinite clays.

Ahrendt (2005) describes the near-surface geology of the hillside where the site of 
investigation is located as a division of three layers: an upper residual soil layer, a lower 
residual soil layer, and a saprolite layer (shown as I-R, II-R, and V-S in Figure 3.11 
respectively).   However, it is important to keep in mind that the exact location of the site 
of investigation was not characterized in detail, but rather included as having the same 
geology of the immediate region around the east facing hillsides (group U4 as shown in 
Figure 3.11).

3.3 Existing Geotechnical Data 
 

A near-surface geotechnical investigation was performed by Mendes et al. (2015) within 
meters of the geophone array line used in this research. Mendes also divides the near-
surface into three layers; the topsoil (H1), mature residual soil that is relatively 
homogenous with no rock matrix structure (H2), and young residual soil or saprolites 
with a rock matrix structure composed of bedrock pieces that have not fully weathered 
into saprolite.   

Geotechnical characterization in the form of sieve analysis, soil gran density, natural 
density, and Atterberg limits (liquid and plastic) were performed from three deformed 
samples that were collected on site (see Figure 3.12, Mendes et al., 2015). The results are 
shown in Table 3.1.

Figure 4.2 –An illustration of the “fixed” long array and the “move-along” short arrays used for surveys 2 and 3. 

An experimental SH refraction survey was performed in 2014 (Survey #1 in Table 4.1) 
that was not involved with this work. This survey was performed on the same survey line 
as illustrated in Figure 4.1. However, as the survey was only experimental and not a 
conventional refraction survey, it was only performed only with sources with three 
different offsets on one side of the array. The source was a sledgehammer, which was 
used to hit against a metal plate that was wedged with its side into the earth to allow for a 
lateral force to generate SH waves. Shots were stacked 5 times to attenuate noise.  

Three field surveys were performed for this research by the author and a crew from IAG 
– USP (surveys 2,3 &amp;amp; 4 in Table 4.1). Surveys 2 and 3 are identical in all their 
characteristics with the exception of the geophone type and the date performed; survey 2 
was conducted in May of 2015 and survey 3 in June of 2015. One long array and three 
short arrays were used for surveys 2 and 3 (see Figure 4.2).

Figure 4.3 - Configuration of the circular array used for the passive-
MASW survey. 

A “fixed” long array was used to maximize the depth of investigation while sacrificing 
any lateral variation, and a set of three “move-along” short arrays were used to obtain 
higher frequency data, by using shorter geophone spacing, and to introduce some lateral 
variation by allowing for three 1-D inversion points at the mid-section of each short array. 
Although surveys 2 and 3 appear identical, by performing the same survey with 
horizontally orientated geophones (oriented in the direction of the geophone line, or 
radially orientated) the radial component of the Rayleigh wave was recorded, despite the 
source being a sledgehammer hitting a steel plate in the vertical direction. The 
multichannel records of surveys 2 and 3 appear to show dispersion of surface wave 
energy indicating the existence of Rayleigh waves at the site.  

And lastly, a passive MASW survey was conducted approximately 150 meters south of 
the site using a circular array (see Figure 3.4). This nearby location was selected because 
it was the nearest site that appeared to not have been disturbed by means of past human 
activity, and because unlike the survey line location of all the other surveys, this location 
was able to accommodate a 2-D geophone array. A passive MASW survey using a linear 
array at the main site of investigation was not performed due to the fact that some 
ambient noise energy will arrive obliquely to the linear array and will appear with higher 
“apparent” velocities than the real velocity of the noise (Louie, 2001). A circular array 
was chosen as it equally records energy from all directions, providing higher resolutions 
for ambient sources from all directions. The largest diameter that the site allowed for was 
used (15 m), as only the deeper layering is of interest at this location. Despite its distance 
from the original area of study some useful information can be obtained from this passive 
survey; in particular the deeper geological structure, which it is more likely to share with 
the original survey line location.

Chapter 5 – Data Processing and Analysis 
 

5.1 Refraction Data 
 

Rayfract® recommends at least one shot per every sixth receiver in an array for a reliable 
WET tomography inversion. Although the survey used for P wave refraction analysis 
does not follow this recommendation, a considerable amount of shot locations were 
recorded for considerable wave coverage. The SH refraction survey however was 
experimental and has a very limited wave coverage.  

 

5.1.1 SH Wave Refraction Data 
 

The first arrival picks of SH refraction data can be seen in Appendix D.1. Unfortunately, 
as the survey was not intended for refraction tomography analysis there are only a limited 
amount of source locations, only three in fact. As a result, there is a very limited amount 
of wave coverage (see Figure D.6 in Appendix D) and therefore the smoothed WET 
inversion results (Figure D.5 in Appendix D) are not very reliable. But nevertheless, it 
suggests a shallow layer at around a meter in depth.    

 

5.1.2 P Wave Refraction Data 
 

The first arrival picks of P refraction data can be seen in Appendix D.2. It is clear from 
wave coverage graph (Figure D.10 of Appendix D) that there is much more wave 
coverage in the P refraction survey as compared to the SH refraction survey. As a result 
the smoothed WET inversion results (Figure D.9 of Appendix D) are considered to be 
much more reliable. The inversion results suggest again a layer interface at around a 
meter in depth, another at 2 meters, and one more interface between six to twelve meters 
in depth.

5.2 Love Wave Data 
 

A dispersion image is obtained from SurfSeis© after processing the multichannel records 
of the SH refraction survey. It is evident from visual inspection that the 24 Hz geophones 
did not record low enough frequencies to properly distinguish a fundamental mode Love 
wave. As a result, fundamental mode inversion was not performed. However a simple 
inspection of the dispersion image at higher frequencies reveals a minimum velocity of 
150 m/s, suggesting that the SH wave velocity of the surface layer is 150 m/s.

5.3 Passive MASW  
 

The results of the passive MASW survey are consistent with near surface velocities from 
other methods. Surprisingly the fundamental mode appears to be visible up to 40 Hz, 
however, any pattern is lost below 10 Hz. Interestingly, the interface depths also appear 
to share similarities with the refraction inversion results.

5.4 A-Priori Model 
 

After considering the preceding inversion results and the existing geological and 
geotechnical data an a-priori model is created to consider for MASW Rayleigh wave 
inversion. This model is shown below in Figure 5.3.

5.5 Active MASW  
 

The active source MASW analysis data can be viewed in Appendix E.  Section E.1.1 
shows all the dispersion images associated with the short arrays used on the geophone 
line for the shallow survey. It is important to note that the combination of horizontal and 
vertical components aid in highlighting the fundamental mode at certain frequencies. In 
many cases the fundamental mode was masked in the vertical component at certain 
frequency ranges, and therefore by combining it with the horizontal (or radial) 
component it reemerged. Likewise section E.2.1 shows the dispersion images for the long 
array for deeper investigation.  

Inversion results for the short arrays and long array are shown in E.1.2 and E.2.2, 
respectively. For the short arrays in E.1.2, inversions are performed for the picked 
dispersion curves using default initial models in ParkSEIS©, and these inversions are 
interpolated to create a pseudo two-dimensional inversion. Afterwards, an a-priori model 
is created and used as the initial model in SurfSeis© for the same dispersion curves.  
Unfortunately, this a-priori model caused an error in the inversion of the long array 
dispersion curve in E.2.2. This may have some relation with the rather unusual Poisson’s 
ratio and density values in the model. The best selected inversion of E.2.2 as well as the 
inversion of its redefined dispersion curve appear to suggest an interface (perhaps of 
residual soil and saprolite) at around 5 m, followed by gradual increases in velocity until 
25 m, where bedrock is not found as the low-frequency data is not available.  

An extra low-frequency point is then selected for the best selected inversion of E.2.2 to 
better define the inversion at low frequencies (Figure E.13). A reasonable shear wave 
velocity profile is inverted in SurfSeis© (using the default initial model) to obtain Figure 
E.14. The author believes this inversion to be the most representative 1-D shear wave 
velocity profile of the site of investigation. This is due to the fact that it agrees well with 
refraction and other surface wave results, as well as the interfaces defined by geological 
and geotechnical data. In order to further investigate the validity of this inversion, a 
comparison between synthetic and real data is shown in section E.2.3. 

The synthetic data is obtained using the modeling module in ParkSEIS©, which is based 
on the reflectivity method by Fuchs and Müller, 1971. The code itself is based on a DOS 
executable created by Dr. Adam O’Neill at Kyoto University, which is based on codes 
provided by Dr. Klaus Holliger at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Dr. 
Michael Roth at NORSAR. The inputted model (inverted model from Figure E.14) is 
shown in Figure E.15, and the resulting side-by-side comparisons of synthetic and field 
seismograms and dispersion images are shown in Figures E.16-20. 



Ch. 6 – Results and Conclusions

Chapter 6 – Results and Conclusions 
 

6.1 Limitations and Shortcomings  
 

There are some serious limitations to the inversion of perceived fundamental mode 
Rayleigh wave energy through MASW analysis, using inversion based on simplified two-
dimensional forward modeling approaches, which assume flat layering and homogenous 
and isotropic behavior in each layer. These limitations include but are not limited to: 

? Human error involved in dispersion curve picking 
? Human error in the field during field measurements 
? Non-uniqueness of fundamental mode dispersion curve inversion 
? Violations of perfectly layered homogeneous isotropic media  
? The abundance of local minima in the inversion solution space 
? Lack of lateral resolution 

To test inversion reliability, two models where tested using the author’s MATLAB® 
code, which utilizes the objective function described in Eq. 2.14 and the fminsearch 
algorithm in the inversion processes based on the fundamental mode dispersion curve. 
These models and the inversion results are shown in Appendix C. Model 1 is a simplified 
two-layer model, and Model 2 is a 6-layer model from Xia et al., 1999. The inversion of 
Model 1 is shown in Figure C.3, with only a single initial model, which has similar 
property profiles, but has a dispersion curve that is quite far from Model 1’s. The right 
hand side of Figure C.3 shows how the simple fminsearch based inversion scheme finds a 
good fit in terms of the dispersion curve, ??, and ??, but is unable to find a good match 
for density. Inverting Model 2 on the other hand is much more complicated. Figure C.6 
shows the inversion results of Model 2 and how they differ with 9 different initial models, 
which only differ in the value of ?? (by modifying the Poisson’s ratio), and depth to the 
half-space. The results highlights the abundance of local minima of the objective function 
(Eq. 2.14), and how important initial models are in the inversion process. To have the 
best initial model it is imperative to have as much knowledge of the parameters as 
possible. The sensitivity analysis in Figure C.7 reveals that the thicknesses of each layer 
influences the dispersion curve the greatest, followed by ??, with little contribution from 
??, and practically no influence from density.   

 

6.2 Areas of Future Improvement 
 

MASW and surface wave analysis in general are currently very active research topics 
(Socco et al, 2010). A promising new research includes a new method called “Polar 
Mute”, which mutes higher mode energy in the dispersion image by separating prograde 
and retrograde motion (Gribler, 2015). It is conceivable that more muting techniques will 



Ch. 6 – Results and Conclusions 
 

 
53 

further help in isolating the energy of different modes in the dispersion image. However, 
an altogether different approach is the inversion of the dispersion image itself. Dal Moro 
has dubbed this “Full Velocity Spectrum Inversion” (Moro, 2015). This approach 
eliminates the human error involved in picking the fundamental mode dispersion curve 
from the dispersion image, or “Full Velocity Spectrum”. Another approach is the 
inversion of the “effective dispersion curve” (Moro, 2015). The effective dispersion 
curve is essentially the curve, which follows the pattern of highest energy on the 
dispersion image. Tokimatsu et al., 1992 provides the relationships between the effective 
dispersion curve and the modal dispersion curves. The most computationally intensive 
inversion method is full waveform inversion. However, this method and is rarely used for 
near surface applications. Perhaps the most complete inversion possible would be a full 
waveform inversion assuming a viscoelastic-anisotropic-inhomogeneous medium, but 
computer technology has not reached the level to where this would be practicable for 
most applications.  

 

6.3 Final Conclusions 
 

It is the author’s opinion that the biggest drawback to the MASW method (as defined in 
this research) is the relatively long array length (and therefore lack of lateral resolution) 
required to obtain higher resolution dispersion images and the uncertainty in picking the 
dispersion curve. Ultimately, a series of picked points on the perceived fundamental 
mode dispersion curve from phase-shifted seismic data does not necessarily invert into 
reliable results. However crude this method may appear, it can be quite powerful and 
effective when combining data from both horizontal and vertical components, 
implementing various filtering tools, and knowing some a-priori information (particularly 
at depths, which correspond to the most sensitive frequencies of the dispersion curve). 

It appears that the MASW results in this research have not only confirmed the refraction 
WET tomography inversion results, but also inverted realistic deeper shear wave velocity 
profiles (though unfortunately not reaching the bedrock). Ultimately, the maximum 
invertible depth at the site of investigation is limited to the length of the array, which was 
limited by the site constraints of the site of investigation. Although this method still has 
some way to improve, it is without question a valuable tool to increase the amount of 
subsurface information from a conventional refraction or linear array seismic survey.    

With respect to implications of the results to land slide risk, one can see a consistent near 
surface layer interface from virtually all sources (geotechnical, refraction, and surface 
wave) at around one meter in depth. This is characterized as the interface between the 
top-soil layer and the residual soil. This interface depth appears to be consistent with the 
slip surfaces reported by Ahrendt (2005), and therefore is potentially related to the slip 
surface depths of the landslides that occurred in Campos do Jordão the winter of 
1999/2000. However, the depth to bedrock was not obtainable due to the limited array 
length, and the water level was not found due to the limited depth of the P wave WET 
tomography inversion results.

Elastic Wave Theory 
 

The following section gives an overview of the equations that define the motion of 
seismic waves in media that can be characterized as linearly-elastic, homogenous, and 
isotropic.  

The justification of the elasticity assumption is based on the observation that “small 
mechanical perturbations traverse particulate media without causing permanent effects or 
altering on-going processes.” (Santamarina, 2001). However, this statement is only valid 
for small-strain waves. Large-strain waves may be generated in the near field of sources 
and in the near surface during earthquakes (Santamarina, 2001). As a result, the following 
equations are not valid in the near-field of a source and for very large “earthquake” 
magnitude sources. However, for small strains the soil behaves essentially as a linear 
medium (Foti, 2000). 

 

 

Figure A.1 - Stress-strain curves under elastic, elastic-plastic, plastic, and viscoelastic regimes. E represents Young’s 
Modulus in Elastic regions. Note that viscoelastic behavior is curved due to a time delay as a results of the absorption 
of energy.

A.2 A Review of Hooke’s Law 
 

Hooke’s law relates stress and strain through Young’s modulus ? and Poisson’s ratio ? 
(Santamarina, 2000). Let us apply Hooke’s law to define strain in terms of stress and 
vice-versa.

The constitutive relations derived from Hooke’s law allows us to redefine the stresses and 
strains on a three-dimensional element.

We can imagine the setting shown in Figure A.5, where we consider all the stresses 
acting on an element during wave propagation (isolated for the x-direction). Newtonian 
physics dictates that the sum of all forces must be equal to the inertial force of the 
element (Santamarina, 2000). Therefore, we can state that,

Body Waves: 

From these wave equations we define the fundamental seismic body waves, P-waves and 
S-waves. And we assume the wave has propagated sufficiently from the source to be 
considered a plane wave. 

For a compressional (P) wave we know that displacement only exists in the direction of 
propagation and therefore we have,

Dispersion Function Codes 
 

The inversion of surface wave dispersion is only possible by means a forward modeling 
equation or algorithm. Forward modeling surface wave dispersion requires solving the 
wave equation, an often very difficult task. The most common approaches involved using 
the transfer matrix method, introduced by Thomson (1950) and Haskel (1953).  

The following is a compact code written in the MATLAB® language that utilizes the 
Rayleigh wave dispersion algorithm provided by De Lucena (2014). This function inputs 
angular frequency, Rayleigh wave phase velocity, and the parameters of a layered model 
(i.e. ??,??,?,? for each layer). The output of the function varies with frequency and 
phase velocity, but when it reaches zero (i.e. a root) the inputs represent a point on a 
dispersion curve. Another algorithm (not provided in this report) was developed to find 
all the roots of this function to eventually plot the dispersion curves.

The following MATLAB® code was written by the author after translating it from 
Schwab and Knopoff’s (1972) Love wave dispersion Fortran code.  This code performs 
exactly the same function as the above Rayleigh wave dispersion function code, but for 
the Love wave. This function inputs angular frequency, Love wave phase velocity, and 
the following parameters of a layered model: ??,?,?, for each layer.
