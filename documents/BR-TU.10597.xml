resumo 
 
 

Os ecossistemas urbanos representam um elevado consumo de recursos, 
tendo um efeito insustentável no meio ambiente. Os solos urbanos são 
utilizados durante o desenvolvimento urbano e necessitam de ser geridos para 
serem preservados e deste modo manter o seu papel de suporte e aumentar a 
qualidade de vida. Sendo os solos considerados fontes e acumuladores de 
poluição é importante desenvolver metodologias para avaliação da qualidade 
ambiental de solos urbanos como ferramenta de gestão sustentável dos 
recursos.  
As zonas urbanas são afectadas por uma enorme variedade de actividades 
antropogénicas, sendo as mais importantes o tráfego e a indústria. Estarreja é 
uma importante área industrial situada no noroeste de Portugal, estando o 
complexo químico localizado apenas aproximadamente a 1 km do centro 
urbano. 
Assim, e de modo a obter uma caracterização geral da área de estudo, foram 
recolhidas informações acerca do clima, topografia, geologia, tipo de solo, 
dados ambientais (emissões para atmosfera, poluição da água, etc.), 
planeamento local, população, uso do solo e caracterização da indústria. Os 
pontos de amostragem foram depois seleccionados com base em fotografias 
aéreas, mapas de solo e observação no campo. De seguida foram 
seleccionados alguns indicadores da qualidade de solos urbanos, tendo em 
conta que um indicador útil para uma gestão sustentável dos solos deve ser 
sensível a mudanças na gestão. Finalmente, e com ajuda de instrumentos de 
SIG, foi possível obter uma visualização da variabilidade espacial dos 
parametros estudados. O estudo de indicadores de qualidade, aliado à 
informação recolhida inicialmente é essencial  como  apoio a processos de 
decisão, permitindo uma melhor sustentabilidade na gestão dos recursos 
urbanos. Permite ainda uma monitorização das mudanças na qualidade 
ambiental que ocorrem e definir quais as principais fontes de poluição que 
afectam os centros urbanos.

abstract 
 

Urban systems represent high turnover of resources, having an effect on the 
environment in an unsustainable manner. Urban soils are used during urban 
development and needs to be managed if it is to be preserved and maintained 
its role in supporting and enhancing the quality of life. Since soil can be 
considered both as a source and as a sink of pollution, it is important to 
develop and validate a methodology for the assessment of environmental 
quality in urban soils, as a tool for sustainable resource management.  
The urban areas are affected by a wide variety of anthropogenic activities, such 
as traffic and industry. Estarreja is a very important industrial area of Northwest 
Portugal, being the chemical complex located near (1 km away) the town 
centre of the urban area also called Estarreja.  
Therefore, data about the climate, topography, geology, soil type, other 
environmental data (air emissions, water pollution, etc.), local planning, 
population (type and distribution), industry characterisation and distribution, 
land use, transports and energy inputs, were collected in order to have a 
general characterization of the study area. The sampling sites were chosen 
based on aerial photographs, soil maps and field observation.  
Indicators of urban soil quality were then chosen taking into account that as a 
useful indicator of land management practices sustainability, a soil parameter 
must respond sensitively to changes in management. Finally GIS tool were 
used to show spatial variability of contaminant. The main usefulness of this 
study is the important information for decision-making, allowing a better 
sustainable resource management in very industrialized urban areas. These 
results of urban indicators, allied with data collected are essential for 
sustainable urban planning allowing a more efficient management of resources 
available as well as an effective control of state changes occurring in the 
environmental quality of urban ecosystems, particularly in what concerns urban 
soils. They also allow defining the main causes of pollution affecting urban 
areas.

Soils are part of the ecosystem, acting as an interface between the hydrosphere, 

atmosphere, biosphere and lithosphere. It provides functions as filtering, buffering, 

transformation and storage of contaminants and nutrients, decomposition of organic 

contaminants and groundwater recharge, protection and mineralization (Norra &amp;amp; Stüben, 

2003). Nevertheless, these functions are limited and overuse can endanger the environment 

and the quality of life, therefore soils must be subject of sustainable urban planning 

development and legislation.  

 Human activities are damaging soils and leading to irreversible losses, for that reason, 

and as they are a limited resource, soils need to be conserved. Agricultural intensification, 

urbanization and industrialization are contributing to erosion, local and diffuse contamination 

and sealing of soil surfaces. Pressures on soils, associated to natural factors such as 

climate, have a significant impact on soil chemical, physical and biological characteristics. 

These changes in the environment may modify soil properties, such as pH, electrical 

conductivity (EC), organic matter content (OM) or cation exchange capacity (CEC) and 

therefore certain soil functions and the availability of contaminants may also be altered. As a 

consequence soil is degraded, being the main causes: erosion, compactation and crusting, 

acidification, salinization and sodification, accumulation of toxic elements and depletion of 

nutrients. 

 Soil protection is normally addressed indirectly through measures to protect water and air, 

or developed within a secondary protection. This is mainly due to soils great buffering 

capacities, slow reactions to contaminants and its natural spatial variability. The last one is 

a specific problem of the soil compartment that makes difficult the distinction between 

natural anomalies and those resulting from human activities (Mol et al., 1998). In this 

context, it is very important the development of policies that take into account the role of 

soils, the problems arising from the competition among its multiple uses (ecological and 

socio-economical), and that aims towards the maintenance of its multiple functions. 

Therefore, a sustainable management of soil as a natural resource, together with air and 

water is a major environmental challenge.  

 Urban areas are the geographic focus of resource consumption and chemical emissions. 

As a consequence, urban soils receive a load of contaminants larger than those received in 

surrounding fields due to concentration of anthropogenic activities. Examples of 

contamination sources in urban environment include atmospheric deposition, industry, traffic 

and manipulation of pesticides and fertilizers. Contaminants can pass to the food chain by 

inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact of dust and particulate matter. Moreover, soil 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS

contaminants may be recirculated by re-volatilization, in the water solution or uptaked by 

biota. Such processes contribute to reduce air and water quality and biomagnification of 

pollutants with consequent decrease in the standard of living, mainly in urban areas. Sealing 

and total erosion due to excavation are other factors that are consuming urban soils. These 

factors, allied with an increase in urban population (in European Union is increasing up to 

80%) are acting as ecosystems factors leading to new soil properties. Urban systems 

represent, therefore, a high turnover of resources, having an effect on the environment in an 

unsustainable manner.  

Since soil can be considered both as a source and as a sink of pollution, it is important to 

develop and validate a methodology for the assessment of environmental quality in urban 

soils, as a tool for sustainable resource management. An urban planning together with an 

efficient use of urban areas and re-utilization and recycling of abandoned areas can be 

important in sustainable development of cities. Therefore, and considering urban 

environment degradation, it is fundamental and urgent to develop comparable and 

reproducible methodologies of soil quality assessment in urban settings.  

The purpose of this work is to study the geochemistry and environmental quality of urban 

soils. As a case study it was chosen Estarreja, a small city from northwest Portugal, 

notorious for its chemical industry. For the quality assessment of urban soils from Estarreja, 

data about the climate, topography, geology, soil type and other environmental data 

(atmospheric emissions, water pollution, etc.), were collected in order to have a general 

characterization of the study area. Socio-economic indicators were also collected, as 

these are driving forces for the formation of a city as environment. A general 

characterization of soils was first performed followed by the study of more specific indicators 

such as levels of potentially toxic metals and organic contaminants. Basic and multivariate 

statistical procedures and GIS tools were used to identify sources of pollution and 

discriminate natural and anthropogenic contributions as well as point sources of 

contamination. In conclusion, this study aims at identifying possible sources of contamination 

(industry, agriculture or the urban area), assessing the suitability of soil to its use and to 

contribute for land use planning in accordance to soil characteristics. To better understand

2.1. Urban soils issues 
According to the European Community (EC, 2004) soils of urban areas have specific benefits 

and dis-benefits for quality of live spectra such as health, social, economical, technical and 

environmental qualities. These soils are defined as soils which occur within the boundary of 

an urban community and they include natural, man-modified and man-made soils. These last 

two types may occur outside the urban communities.  

 Urban soil is used during urban development and it needs to be managed in order to 

preserve and maintain its role of supporting and enhancing quality of life. The main functions 

of an urban soil are: the support of infra-structures, recreation/landscaping/leisure, 

preservation of air and water quality, life support (ecological), natural heritage, health cost 

reduction and heat balance. However, sealing soils, more than losing soils for agricultural 

and forestry, will limit ecological functions of soil, such as storage of carbon or habitat for 

unique biota. Indirect effects may be the fragmentation of habitats and disrupt of 

ecological corridors. Moreover, water runoff may increase, resulting in a higher risk of 

floods. Other problem is the accumulation of contaminants in urban soils that not only 

degrades soil quality but can also pose a health risk to humans and the ecosystem (Wong et 

al., 2004). For example, in areas where public gardens and parks are exposed to 

significant pollution levels, dust from ground may have toxic effects as a consequence of 

inhalation or ingestion by humans, particularly children (Manta et al., 2002).  

The knowledge about processes of urban soil genesis and the role of soil in urban 

ecosystems is essential for environmental-impact assessments due to the fact that soil is 

an important source and sink of contaminants. Urban soils development does not only 

depend of natural factors as in natural areas, but also of the socio-economical processes, 

including planning that can become sometimes predominant factors. The genesis of urban 

soils is based on conditions that are not found in natural or agricultural systems. During 

urban development soils are damaged and modified especially by land use changes and 

engineering requirements and original soils are often buried, removed, compacted and 

contaminated. Sometimes local urban soil is replaced by foreign soil of inferior quality. In 

some cases these soils consist of slags, ashes, waste, building rubble, tar, sludge, etc, or 

mixed with natural substances. Other peculiar characteristics of urban soils are the 

unpredictable layering, poor structure and high concentrations of trace elements (Manta et 

al., 2002). Therefore, hydrology, degree of sealing and compressing may differ from 

natural soils. An important issue related to urban areas is the diffuse pollution, being the 

main causes the combustion processes, the waste disposal from traffic, households and 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 8  
 

industry, changes in land use type and intensity, the precipitation, the air temperature, 

humidity and soil parent material (Norra &amp;amp; Stüben 2003). As a consequence of all these 

specific characteristics, urban soils have specific soil chemistry, being the main factors 

responsible for the pattern: atmospheric deposition, waste disposal, construction activities, 

coal burning waste and sealing (Manta et al., 2002; Norra &amp;amp; Stüben, 2003). Furthermore, 

in an urban environment it is possible to classify different land uses according to its 

influence such as traffic, industrial, commercial, disposal sites, cemeteries, housing and 

parks.  

 

2.2. General characterization of urban ecosystems: data collection 
A comprehensive preliminary characterization of the ecosystem is essential to define the 

set of soil properties to be assessed, in order to provide a suitable soil quality assessment 

of the urban area. It will also allow defining the criteria for selection of sampling sites and 

establish sampling and analytical procedures.  

 The main objective of data collection is to characterise the urban ecosystems by 

gathering all the available information about land use management. General data about 

climate, topography, geology, soil type and specific environmental data (such as 

atmospheric emissions and water pollution), are collected in order to have a general 

characterization of the study area. A socio-economic characterisation of the city is also 

important as some pressures on soil consumption may be socio-economic factors such as 

the high dependence of gross national income from land consumption (EC, 2004). Most of 

our modern social economic activities depend on the construction, maintenance and 

existence of sealed areas. Housing, mobility and communication, supply with goods and 

services, security, health, traditional construction and urban architecture demand sealing are 

also factors that will influence the soil use (EC, 2004). This way, it should be collected 

information about urban planning, population (type and distribution), industry typology and 

distribution, land use, transports and energy inputs. Therefore, and in order to perform a 

comprehensive assessment of the soil quality of an urban ecosystem, the following 

features should be considered: 

• History: age of the city, traditional occupations, resources available through time, 
historical development, historical parks, historical buildings and infra-structures, 

archaeological sites, planning models used over time, historical industrial 

development; 



 

GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 9 
 

• Demography and socio-economic indicators: size of the city, population 
density, evolution of resident population, employment and health statistics, 

education degree statistics, housing conditions, gross domestic product, degree of 

technological development, types of industry and commercial services; 

• Land use: historic land use, present and planned land use, land use density, 
regulatory framework of territorial planning, percentage of sealed and urbanised 

land, percentage of forest, urban agricultural and green areas, percentage of 

derelict land, delimitation of the urban area, delimitation and area of the city centre, 

transport patterns and traffic intensity; 

• Natural conditions: available natural resources, flood areas, topography and 
slope, ground stability, groundwater resources and hydrological features, geology 

(bedrock and soil types), biodiversity and protected habitats, species of special 

interest; 

• Climate: temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed and direction, cloud 
cover, solar radiation; 

• Pollution sources: characterisation of main driving forces for physical, chemical 
and microbiological pollution and their emissions – industrial, commercial, 

household, agricultural and gardening, waste management, traffic, construction, 

tourism and energy sectors; historical data on point and diffuse sources. 

 

 In conclusion, data collection in preliminary assessments of urban soil quality should 

allow: to define and characterise elements and components of the urban ecosystem under 

study; define patterns of soil uses; a preliminary evaluation of soil functions and of 

changes in natural features and their spatial distribution; identify natural habitats of special 

importance, potentially contaminated sites and potentially toxic elements and substances.  

 

2.3.  Sampling strategy and sample preparation of urban soils 
Sampling and sample preparation procedures for the investigation of soils are regarded as 

the first and most important step towards a more comparable and reproducible analysis of 

soil (Wagner et al., 2001), and must to be planned in accordance with the objectives of the 

study. In fact, when performing a sampling plan one has to keep in mind that the major 

objective of sampling is to be representative and that sampling and sample pre-treatment 

shall be “fit-for-purpose” (Barbizzi et al., 2004; Kurfu ?rst et al., 2004). 

 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 10  
 

 Regarding urban soils, the level and spatial pattern of soil quality parameters need to 

be taken into account, and characterising this variability is an essential step, even though 

very complex, for an environmental survey. Therefore, the preparation of a sampling plan 

that include the sampling design for assessing soil quality/ contamination is a key step on 

the whole process as samples should be truly representative.  

 In what concerns to soil sampling there are some important issues that should be 

addressed: a) how methodologies might affect data quality; b) the sources of deviation or 

uncertainties; c) the comparability and representativeness of soil sampling or the sampling 

guidelines that are not harmonised (Theocharopoulos et al., 2001). The usual geostatistical 

data treatment assumes a precise protocol for sampling as well as mapping of sampling 

sites. It requires also a minimum number of field measurements and analytical 

determinations to enable useful interpretation of the results. However, in the case of urban 

soils it is not always possible to collect a number of samples enough for the geostatistical 

analysis; besides, the choice of sampling sites is usually restricted to the available land (not 

sealed) and public areas. 

 A preliminary sampling strategy should be defined, by choosing potential sampling sites, 

based on interpretation of available documents such as maps, aerial photographs, satellite 

images and also on field observations. All information collected about the urban 

ecosystem should also be taken in consideration when defining the potential sites for 

sampling. An important question that should be answered before the sampling campaign 

starts is sampling density in urban area. It is important to have representative samples of 

different land uses, covering all the urban area. The land uses to be sampled should also 

be previously selected and they may include: ornamental gardens (OG), parks (PO), 

roadsides (RD), riverbanks (RB), kindergartens (KT), agricultural (AG) and railway sides 

(RL).  

 The sampling plan should also include a detailed scheme with instructions for 

sampling, pre-treatment and storage of samples. A sampling protocol should be 

established well in advance before the sampling starts and it should include the sampling 

equipment (corers, augers), quantity of sample to collect, cleaning of samplers and 

containers to hold the samples (depending on the parameter to analyse, e.g. inorganic vs. 

organic compounds). It should also include all the processing steps after sampling: when 

and how the samples will be transported to the lab; contamination controls procedures; 

samples pre-treatment and samples storage. It is also important to have a list of material 

needed for sampling and to define previously how each sample will be labelled, with a 



 

GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 11 
 

unique sample code. A field data inventory should be also completed in the field, including 

information helpful when evaluating the results: a detailed description of the sampling 

area, including the site location/ age and land use considerations such as description of 

the surroundings, traffic intensity and possible contamination sources. 

 In conclusion, the main objectives when defining the sampling plan are the selection of 

sites to collect urban soil samples and how it will be performed the collection of samples. 

The first one includes the definition of sampling regimes (classes of urban soil to be 

considered) and the establishment of a sampling strategy (sampling sites/points carefully 

defined and the sampling design defined). Once again, the sampling plan will be 

dependent on the objectives of the study and materials and methods used for sampling, 

storage and analysis can not interfere with the analyte and/or matrix.  

 

2.4. Definition and assessment of general indicators of urban soils quality 
Defining soil quality in objective terms is very difficult as the concept is diffuse and it must 

reflect a range of social, cultural and economic factors as well as biophysical properties. 

Karlen et al. (1997), defined soil quality as 'the capacity of a specific kind of soil to 

function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal 

productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and 

habitation'.  

 However, many other definitions of soil quality can be found (Diack &amp;amp; Stott, 2001): 

a) “Degree of suitability to the specific functions that soils perform in a given system”.  

b) “The capacity of the soil to promote the growth of plants; protect the watersheds by 

regulating infiltration and partitioning of precipitation; and prevent water and air pollution 

by buffering potential pollutants” (US National Research Council definition).  

 

 The difficulty in establishing only one definition comes from the variety of land uses, 

location, environments, types of soils and a general lack of understanding between the 

interactions of processes occurring within soil.  

 Soil quality requirements will be dependent of the application considered. For example, 

requirements for general purposes are basic requirements regarding plant nutrients, salt 

content, swell and shrink behaviour on wetting and drying, rewettability of the soil 

(hydrophobic behaviour), homogeneity of the soil material and soil pollution (Huinink, 

1998). In urban soils the requirements may have to be adopted for applications such as 

ornamental planting, ornamental trees, herbaceous grass, road verges or construction. In 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 12  
 

addition, although there are many indicators that reflect the current capacity of the soil to 

function, there are only a few that can predict the capacity of the soil to support a range of 

disturbance regimes. Moreover, soil quality cannot be measured directly from soil alone 

but inferred from soil characteristics and behaviour under specific conditions.  

 According to Diack &amp;amp; Stott (2001) there are two approaches to quantify soil quality: 

descriptive and indicative. The first one is concerned with the characterization of different 

attributes of quality and the second one with the identification of specific indicators or 

parameters that will assess the ability or capacity of an attribute to function in a desired 

manner. The objective is to identify and measure specific indicators to better define urban 

soil quality.  

 According to European Environmental Agency (EEA, 2005), an indicator is a measure, 

usually quantitative, that can be used to illustrate and communicate complex phenomena 

simply, including trends and progress over time. It provides a clue to a matter of larger 

significance or makes perceptible a trend or phenomenon that is not immediately 

detectable. Indicators should be chosen taking into account that as a useful indicator of 

the sustainability of land management practices, a soil parameter must respond 

sensitively to changes in management (Doran &amp;amp; Parkin, 1996). When characterizing soil 

quality over a short-time period, critical properties must also be sensitive to changes in 

soil disturbances and inputs into soil system (Diack &amp;amp; Stott, 2001). Moreover, methods to 

quantify soil quality must assess changes in selected soil attributes over time, but not 

changes influenced by short-term weather patterns. Soils and their indicator values vary 

because of differences in parent material, climatic conditions, topographic or landscape 

position, soil organisms, and type of vegetation. Interpreting indicator measurements to 

separate soil quality trends from periodic or random changes is a major challenge for 

researchers and soil managers.  

 Assessment of soil quality requires the definition of key indicators based on information 

collected in the initial assessment, according to city-specific situations, type of soil use 

and scope of the study. This choice should be made before preparing the sampling plan. 

In this study, a general characterization of soils has made, including pH, cation exchange 

capacity (CEC) and exchangeable bases, particle size distribution (clay, silt, sand), 

elemental analysis (CNHS) and organic matter. More specific analysis, to evaluate the 

extent and the main sources of pollution, include potentially toxic metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, 

Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Hg) and organic compounds (PAHs, PCBs). Other parameters can be

 Page 13 
 

measured, however this will depend on pollution sources known and available analytical 

capabilities. 

 After deciding which indicators will be analysed, analytical methods are chosen and 

QC/QA and assessment procedures for the analytical methods adopted and implemented. 

Analytical methods should be selected among those already available for soil quality, i.e. 

national and internationally accepted methods. Whenever possible standardized methods, 

e.g. ISO or EPA, should be chosen. Nevertheless, new or adapted methods may be 

devised to adequately meet the particular situation of the urban soils.  

 

2.5. Data reporting using statistics and GIS tools 
For data reporting purposes, statistics and GIS tools may be used. The use of descriptive 

statistics and bivariate analysis allow the structural description of the input data. The one-

dimensional analysis can be considered as a useful tool for exploratory analysis of data 

and general characterisation of the studied variables. For the graphical representation of 

data histograms and box-plots may be used, as they are the easiest way of highlighting 

the type of distribution of frequencies and the existence of outliers. By using bivariated 

analysis (e.g. Pearson’s correlation) it is possible to understand how the variables are 

related, by finding correlations between pairs of parameters and therefore assess the 

nature and strength of covariation between factors.  

 As in most of the environmental studies, each site is characterized by multivariate data 

sets and the application of multivariate statistics to quality assessment of urban soils is of 

great importance, since it is able to consider several variables simultaneously and 

therefore allows interpretations that are not possible with univariate statistics. Principal 

Component Analysis (PCA) is a method that depends on the mathematical extraction of 

eigenvectors and eigenvalues from a matrix of sample resemblance values (normally 

Person correlation values). Using matrix algebra, PCA extracts from the matrix of 

correlation coefficients a series of equations (components) which summarise the 

relationships between variables and account for the variation present in the matrix. These 

equations, or principal components, are used to calculate unique sample scores, which 

can be plotted to produce an ordination diagram (Waite, 2000). The aim is to reduce the 

dimension of spaces, or to represent the complexity of relationships between variables in 

the minimum number of dimensions, being the main advantage the identification of 

associations between variables.

Geographic Information System (GIS) is a collection of computer hardware, software, 

and geographic data for capturing, managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of 

geographically referenced information (ESRI - [w1]). The computer system allows 

managing spatial data that is organized to yield useful knowledge, often as coloured maps 

and images, but also as statistical graphics, tables, and various on-screen responses to 

interactive queries. It implies that location of the data items are known in terms of 

geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude). Thus, GIS have functional capabilities for 

data capture, input, manipulation, transformation, visualization, combination, query, 

analysis, modelling and output (AWI - [w2]). GIS can integrate and relate any data with a 

spatial component, regardless of the source of the data (Figure 2.1).  

 

 

Figure 2.1 – Principles of GIS function, how it can integrate and relate data with a spatial 
component (ESRI- [w1]). 

 
The geographic information systems (GIS) are very useful in urban soils to show 

spatial variability of contaminants, being an easy way to identify, for e.g., sites exceeding 

the risk-based standards. With these tools, areas of potential or actual risk and areas 

were it is needed some kind of intervention can be identified. The analysis of the results 

obtained, compared with soil and land use (past and present) may lead to the 

identification of the main sources of pollution and degradation in the cities (former and 

present). Therefore, soil maps are important information for decision-making and can be

used for regulation purposes by Local Authorities since they show basic information for 

soil conservation and sustainable urban development (Norra &amp;amp; Stüben, 2003). 

 

2.6. The importance of Quality Control/ Quality Assurance (QC/QA) in 
quality assessment of urban soils 
“Quality control is the set of procedures used to measure and, when necessary, to correct 

data quality. Quality assurance is the set of procedures used to provide documentary 

assurance of the proper application of quality control and the resulting data quality” 

(Environment Canada, 2001). Quality assurance and quality control refer not only to the 

determination step but to all the steps of the analytical process, which in the case of soil 

quality studies can be considered as follows: definition of soil quality study, soil sampling, 

soil sample pre-treatment and storage, soil sample analysis, data reporting, conclusions 

and recommendations. Moreover, consistency in analysis can only be achieved if there is 

uniformity in procedures and nomenclature of all the steps mentioned (NEPC, 1999). The 

total uncertainty associated to the final results is, therefore, a sum of different 

contributions coming from the different steps of an analytical method: sampling, storage, 

treatment, analysis and data reporting. 

 The analysis itself can be nowadays considered under control or can be put under 

control following adequate precautions, due to the high performances of instrumental 

apparatus. Data treatment tends to be neglected as a QC/QA procedure, but it can also 

be a source of errors and therefore it should be under a strict control.  

 To control sample treatment QC/QA considerations should be integrated on the 

definition of the methodology, in order to assure representativeness and reliability of the 

results obtained. Standardized analytical methods (ISO methods) should be used 

whenever possible. Apart of this, the methods should be validated and quality of data 

assured by quality control measures. The QC/QA procedures includes the use of method 

blanks, that means processing the solvents and reagents in exactly the same way as 

samples giving the analytical signal that is not derived from the sample but from reagents, 

glassware, laboratory environment, etc. As a measure of accuracy, analysis of certified 

reference materials (CRM) should be implemented, especially of those provided by the 

Institute of Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, formerly BCR). They allow an 

evaluation of the performance of the overall analytical method (excluding sampling) rather 

than an evaluation of the extraction efficiency only. As CRM available are not always 

equal to the sample analysed (different matrix, different compounds and concentrations) 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 16  
 

matrix fortified with analytes representative of the analyte class should also be used; 

however these spiking experiments can lead to an overestimation of the real extraction 

efficiency. Recoveries should be then checked and the results can be corrected or not for 

recovery. Quality control charts should be implemented as a tool for internal quality 

control. Variation between replicate analyses should be recorded for each process batch 

to provide an estimate of the precision of the method. 

 Sampling remains far from being under control, being this probably the single largest 

component affecting the value of any chemical measurement. Therefore a good analytical 

protocol must include sampling strategies free of contamination and loss and proper 

storage and stabilization of the samples, which is especially important when dealing with 

trace analysis. Other key issues regarding the QC/QA of results are, the 

representativeness of samples collected and the preparation of a precise sampling plan 

that is crucial to minimize the uncertainties associated to this step of the study.

The Municipality of Estarreja belongs to the district of Aveiro, and in terms of territorial 

divisions it is a part of the “Região Centro (NUT II)” and the “Unidade Territorial do Baixo 

Vouga (NUT III)”. According to census of 2001 (INE, 2002) the Municipality of Estarreja, 

formed by Avanca, Pardilhó, Beduído, Veiros, Salreu, Canelas and Fermelã (Figure 3.1) 

has an area of 108.2 km2, with a resident population of 28,182 individuals and a 

population density of 261 inhabitants/km2 (INE, 2002). The urban perimeter of Estarreja 

has an area of 2.5 km2 (Figure 3.2) and is a limited part of Beduído.

 Estarreja Municipality has a close relation with the lagoon of Aveiro (“Ria de Aveiro”) 

which supports a variety of biotopes (channels, islands with vegetation, mudflats, salt 

marshes and agricultural fields) with an important ecological value. Besides the natural 

conditions for harbour, navigation, fisheries (a very important activity for local inhabitants) 

and recreation, the coastal plain around the lagoon supports an intensive and diversified 

agriculture, a variety of heavy and light industries and a population of about half a million 

people are dependent on the environment surrounding Ria de Aveiro. This is, therefore, a 

very industrialized area, due to its five decades of chemical industry, with high 

demographic density and intensive agriculture.

 The present and planned land use of Estarreja has been established by “Plano 
Director Municipal”, a regulatory framework of territorial planning, where all information 

about location of green, urban, industrial and agricultural areas is available. This plan 

also establishes which are the areas of ecological relevance and delimitation of the 

urban area.

3.2. Characterisation of the Estarreja urban ecosystem 
3.2.1 Climate 
Despite its relatively small extension, Portugal has a climate that varies significantly 

among regions and places. The main causes of this variation are the latitude, the distance 

to the sea and, for the regions of the coastal zone, the predominant orientation of the 

shoreline. Estarreja region is characterised by a warm climate with wet and dry seasons. 

A brief description is presented below (Instituto Meteorológico - [w3]: 

 
• Average annual humidity: values ranging from 79 to 88 %; the humidity results 

from the permanent evaporation verified in Ria and there is also a contribution of 

the humidity brought by summer breezes influenced by the Gulf Current. 

 
 



 

GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 21 
 

• Average annual temperature: values ranging from 14.1 to 15.0 ºC; the lowest 
mean temperature range in winter is from 6.1 to 7.0 ºC and the range of the mean 

highest temperatures is from 22.1 to 23.0 ºC. 

• Average annual precipitation: values ranging from 1201 to 1400 mm; the range 
of the mean values for winter is from 401 to 600 mm, while for summer is from 61 

to 100 mm. 

• Predominance of winds: from Northwest (NW) and North (N); in autumn, the 
predominance of NW diminishes, while increasing, gradually, the influence of the 

winds of SE and S. 

• Solar radiation/ hours of insolation: from 110 hours in December to 320 hours 
in July; the total annual is from 2601 to 2700 hours. 

 

3.2.2 Geology and soil type 
Regarding geology, Estarreja is located in the Aveiro´s sedimentary basin. This basin is 

constituted by Quaternary units consisting of alluvium, sand dunes, old beach and terrace 

deposits that occur regionally as a superficial layer or as layers of variable thickness 

(maximum thickness is 25 to 30 m). The Modern Deposits are a system of beaches and 

fluvial terraces in steps, of detritic nature and granolumetries from fine to coarse (Barradas, 

1992; Azevedo, 1999). They are represented by modern alluvions that form the littoral 

regions and sand dunes, being the last ones very significant all over the littoral extending to 

interior. This sedimentary basin is, in the north-eastern edge of the basin where Estarreja 

is located, only a dozen meters thick but as the structure plunges to the west, it may attain 

several tenths of meters (Costa &amp;amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Concluding, three lithological units 

may be individualised in this Quaternary formation: 

- the upper unit, composed of dune sands and alluvium silt-clayey sands, covered 

by organic topsoil; 

-  the intermediate unit, very heterogeneous, with irregular geometry, due to sudden 

vertical and horizontal geologic variations; 

- the lower unit formed by loose conglomerates. 

 The Quaternary deposits overlay the bedrock, constituted by Paleozoic and 

Precambrian rocks in the north, or the Cretaceous formations in the rest of the region as 

shown in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.4 shows the detailed geology of Estarreja region in a scale 

of 1:50.000.

de Portugal, 1972). 

 
 Soils in the area under study are mainly podzols, mainly found in sand dunes and low 

terraces (5-8 m), yet Cambisols can also be found (Ferreira, 1993; Azevedo, 1999). The 

horizons of these soils are well defined and it’s important to note the existence of the B 

illuvial horizon (darker than adjacent ones due to accumulation of organic matter and 

sesquioxides) and the E elluvial (strongly lixiviated). The normal profile of a podzol has the 

horizons O-A-E-BHs-Bs-C.  

 Podzols, according to the Portuguese classification, are divided in two sub-orders: 

hydromorphic (Haplic) and not hydromorphic (Gleyic). The families more represented in 

the study area, are differentiated by the original material and by the cementation grade of 

Horizon B as follows (Azevedo, 1999):

 Podzols are characterized by having low nutrient status, sandy texture, high C/N ratio, 

low CEC, fast permeability and low pH value and therefore they are infertile soils, being 

their agricultural use limited. Inácio et al. (1998) described the soils of Estarreja as 

permeable acidic sandy soils with low humus content. These soils have normally low 

retention capacity and they represent a potential risk of contaminants transfer in the soil–

water–plant system. They are normally reserved for coniferous forestry, low intensity 

grazing or are left fallow. However, if fertilizers, liming and irrigation are practised 

reasonable yields of arable crops may be achieved. The main problems found when 

growing crops regards to aluminium toxicity, restriction of nitrification and phosphorus 

deficiency. Furthermore, podzolization results from the acidification of humus with the

formation of high quantities of organic compounds that migrate to the lower horizons, 

leading to the leaching out of iron and subsequent accumulation in lower horizons. As a 

result, a thin iron pan which is impervious is formed and they may then have 

hydromorphic properties.  

 

3.2.3 Hydrogeology 
One of the most important local resources is the Aveiro multilayer quaternary aquifer that 

covers an area of 650 km2 in the occidental meso-cenozoic sedimentary basin (Condesso 

de Melo, 2002) and can be divided in 3 units, installed in sandy loose formations: the upper, 

the middle and the lower aquifers. Figure 3.5 shows the upper and the lower aquifers.  

The superficial (upper) aquifer is constituted by recent deposits of alluviums and sand 

dunes from Holocene age. These deposits are abundant in the western part along the 

coast and inland along most of the riverbeds. The average thickness ranges between 8 to 

10 m, rarely exceeding 20 m of total thickness. They form a highly permeable (20 to 30 

md-1) shallow aquifer with an area of 500 Km2 (Condesso de Melo et al., 2002). The 

aquifer receives direct or indirect recharge by infiltration of rainwater and irrigation, and 

the discharge occurs in sea, in the lagoon, in the hydrographical network or in other 

adjacent aquifer levels, since induced by positive hydraulic gradients (Condesso de Melo 

et al., 2002). It should be highlighted that there is a piezometric depression in the 

Estarreja area that can be due to its intensive exploration (Condesso de Melo, 2002; 

INAG - [w4]).  

 The lower aquifer, hydraulic free, is formed by old beach deposits and fluvial terraces 

from the Pilo-Pleistocene. These deposits are predominantly coarse sands, gravel 

pebbles, which mainly occur along the eastern part of the region, where they overlay 

either Cretaceous or Triassic formations. The thickness area ranges between 10 to 20 m 

and the average permeability range from 5 to 10 md-1. The natural gradient in the terrace 

deposits is from west to the east (0.004) where they discharge to the principal rivers that 

flow in the area (Condesso de Melo, 2002), being the principal hydrographic basins: 

Vouga, Mondego, Ribeiras da Costa and Mangas das Ribeiras da Costa (in a total of 

924.9 km2). Another important characteristic of this region is the complex network of 

channels from the lagoon (Ria de Aveiro) and the delta of River Vouga. 

 This coastal aquifer is particularly vulnerable to saline intrusion but also, due to the 

high permeability of the sandy deposits and shallowness ground water table, it is 

extremely vulnerable to agricultural, urban and industrial contamination. It is known that in

 Page 25

the Estarreja municipality 79 % of the water from wells is unsuitable for consumption due 

to chemical contamination and 73 % due to bacteriological contamination (CME - [w5]). 

Furthermore, in this region there has been common practice to abstract water from the 

superficial aquifer for drinking, industrial and agricultural purposes. Therefore, appropriate 

management and conservation policies should have been implemented in the region a 

long time ago.

The basis of the economy in Estarreja is the secondary sector with a total of 6011 

persons employed in 2003. From 1991 to 2001 the primary sector has experimented a 

significant decrease (-56.7%) while the tertiary sector has been more important for the

economy of the municipality (INE, 2002). These changes don’t seem to have any 

significant effect in the resident population from the municipality, being the variation 

between 1991 and 2001 of 5.4% (Table 3.2). There was an increase in the resident 

population from Beduído, where Estarreja is located, meaning that population can be 

increasing in the urban area. When looking to the population distribution it’s possible to 

say that this municipality is characterized by a having a high percentage of young people 

(Figure 3.6).

construction and urban architecture are the main factors responsible for pressures in the 

urban environment. Estarreja is a small city, with a small urban area that includes some 

agricultural areas. The main pressures are the industry near the centre and the moving of 

population to town centre. 

 

3.3.1 The industry in Estarreja region 
Table 3.3 shows the distribution of labourers in the industrial activities for Estarreja 

Municipality and for the Aveiro´s District in 2003 (AIDA - [w6]). Besides the utmost 

importance of chemical industry (for which Estarreja is mostly known), other industrial 

activities can also be found in the municipality, such as food and drink, wood, cork, textiles 

and leather. However, agriculture is the most important economic sector (the main 

productive source are animal sector and corn farming).

Processing industries play a major role on local economy (33.4% employment), being 

the sector of metallurgies and metallic products the one that generates more employment 

(4.9%) (INE, 2002). In the second most important sector arise the food, beverages and 

tobacco industries, with 4.5%. In the 50’s and 60’s the production of chemicals and fibbers 

(synthetic or artificial) played the principal role as source of jobs in the municipality of 

Estarreja. Corroborating the observed gradual decrease in the importance of this sector, it 

should be noted that in 1991 this was the most important sector in a matter of employment 

offer and it turned, after ten years, into the fourth activity creator of jobs, highlighting once 

more the deep restructure of the local industry. In spite of the crisis in the chemical 

industry is often related with the increase in the cost of energy (Reis et al., 1996), the 

modernization of the facilities is also responsible for the decrease in the need of labour. 

However, it is remarkable that almost 30% of the labourers in the chemical industry of the 

district are working in Estarreja. 

The major part of chemical industry is located inside the chemical complex called 

“Complexo Químico de Estarreja (CQE)”, an industrial area of 1 km2, located at 1 km from 

the Estarreja town centre (which has an area of about 2.5 km2). The most significant 

industrial units in CQE are: 

- Quimigal [w7]: installed in 1952, produced ammonium sulphate, from sulphuric 

acid and ammonia, since the beginning, and nitric acid and ammonium nitrate 

since 1974. These productions stopped in the early 1990s and a new unit (aniline 

de Portugal) started in 1978 for the production of nitric acid, aniline and 

nitrobenzene, which is still running. Other products are chlorine, sodium hydroxide 

and hydrogen. Since 1990, electrolytic cells with mercury cathodes have been 

substituted by membrane technology.  

- Uniteca [w8]: working since 1956 to produce chlorine, sodium hydroxide, 

hydrogen and derivate compounds as sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid 

from rock salt, using until 1992 electrolytic cells with mercury cathodes.  

- Cires [w9]: the plant started up in 1963 producing only suspension PVC (S-PVC), 

being pioneer in the manufacture of thermoplastics materials. In 1982, emulsion 

PVC started to be manufactured for paste grade resins, the VICIR-E. 

- Dow Portugal [w10]: producing since 1978 isocyanide polymers of aromatic base 

and polystyrene polymers for thermal isolation.

3.3.2 Transport facilities 
The resident population is mostly settled along the major road that crosses the 

municipality in the North-South direction (EN 109), which was during decades one of the 

main connections between the north and centre of coastal Portugal. Other transportation 

facilities are listed below: 

• Roads – IP1, IP5 

• Railroad – “Linha do Norte” 

• Lagoon: Esteiro de Estarreja 

 

3.4. Environmental Quality of Estarreja 
3.4.1 Emissions from nearby industry 
In a context of a lack of information about environmental issues, together with intensive 

industrial activity, during decades, direct discharge of effluents into natural water streams 

and uncontrolled waste disposal on ground were practiced (Hall, 1982; Pereira et al., 

1997; Costa &amp;amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Since 1950s until 1975, the liquid effluents were 

discharged directly into manmade water streams (Vala de S. Filipe, Vale de Breja and 

Vala do Canedo), being transported for several kilometres through the agricultural fields, 

mainly to the river branch named Esteiro de Estarreja that ends in a lagoon basin called 

“Laranjo” (Barradas et al., 1992; Inácio et al., 1998, Costa &amp;amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001). The 

liquid effluents from these industrial units contain mainly aniline, benzene, 

monochlorobenzene, mononitrobenzene, arsenic, mercury, zinc and lead (Batista et al., 

2002). Until 1990 Quimigal and Uniteca used electrolytic cells with mercury cathodes, but 

they have been substituted by a cleaner technology, membrane cells, being this 

conversion finished in 1998. Therefore Hg is one of the most concerns of this area. 

Several studies where conducted in Estarreja in order to assess the local contamination, 

but most of them where mostly focused in the contamination near the industrial complex 

(Inácio et al., 1998; Costa &amp;amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001; Batista et al., 2002) and with the 

contamination through river streams leading to the Ria de Aveiro Lagoon (Abreu et al., 

1998; Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., 2003; Coelho et al., 2005). Other studies 

conducted in this area include the study of Hg in plants, biota and in the water column 

from the lagoon (Ramalhosa et al., 2001; Pereira et al., 2005; Coelho et al., 2006). It has 

been reported high concentrations of toxic pollutants, mainly potentially toxic metals and 

metalloids (namely As, Hg, Pb and Zn), in the soil of the industrial area, however much 

higher concentrations were found in the sediments of the water streams, several

 Page 31

kilometres away from the industrial complex (Costa &amp;amp; Jesus-Rydin, 2001; Batista et al., 

2002). Moreover, it is estimated that, in spite of the strong reduction on the input since 

1994, it will be needed many decades until the Lagoon recovery (Pereira et al., 1997; 

Abreu et al., 1998). 

Inácio et al. (1998) concluded that air contamination was higher next to the emission 

point inside the industrial perimeter decreasing with distance. In terms of air emissions of 

pollutants monitored in a station located inside the urban perimeter, the medium daily 

emission of SO2 was 1.9 µg/m3 in 2006 (Instituto do Ambiente - [w11]), for particulate 

matter less than 10 µm (PM10) in the same year the medium value was 35 µg/m3/day, 

and in what concerns NO2 the value is 19.6 µg/m3/day. These emissions are mainly from 

industrial activities.  

 The Air Quality Index (Instituto do Ambiente - [w11]) for Estarreja area is shown in 

Figure 3.7. This index is a result of an arithmetic average of each pollutant concentration 

in all stations of the area. The values are compared with ranges of concentrations 

associated with a colour scale, with major importance given to the most toxic pollutants.  

 Emission data can also be found in the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER -

[w12]). EPER was established by a Commission Decision of 17 July 2000. The EPER 

Decision is based on Article 15(3) of Council Directive 96/61/EC concerning integrated 

pollution prevention and control. EPER contains data on pollutant emissions to air and 

water reported by around 10,000 large and medium-sized industrial facilities in the former 

15 EU Member States, Hungary and Norway. Fifty pollutants are covered and all reported 

emissions data are publicly accessible through the EPER website.

 Page 37

The definition of a written sampling plan (sampling protocol) with a detailed description of 

procedures to be followed is one of the first steps of the Quality Control/Quality Assurance 

(QC/QA) strategy. The sampling plan for Estarreja took into account the considerations 

mentioned in the previous chapter. The sites were previously selected, the sample strategy 

established and samples collected. The sites selected were not always feasible for sampling, 

and the network had to be kept open and adopted to verification of the field conditions. The 

procedures adopted for sampling and sample pre-treatment were based on ISO (ISO, 

1994a) or USEPA (1996a) methods.  

 

4.1. Sampling design of Estarreja urban soils 
Sites were selected in order to cover the urban area and to have enough number of 

samples for each land use selected. The land uses selected were: ornamental gardens 

(OG), roadsides (RD), parks (PO) and agricultural (AG). Some samples were collected 

outside the urban area in order to compare results with the city centre and to assess what 

are the major influences in the quality of the soils, i.e. the urban area itself or the chemical 

industries near the town centre. It was decided to collect in agricultural sites because 

there are many agricultural areas within the city area, being an important use of the soil in 

Estarreja. Two sampling depths were considered (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) in order to 

assess differences between layers. For each sampling site one of the following sampling 

regimes was adopted (Davidson &amp;amp; Urquhart, 2002): 

a) Sampling Regime 1 
Applicable to larger, visually homogenous, areas of soil where the entire area can be 

defined as a single “site” and where it is desirable to obtain an indication of the average 

soil quality. This could include, for example, areas within parks, gardens, cemeteries, 

forested or agricultural areas (typically &gt; 1 ha). First the area of interest is defined and 

then divided into a regular grid. The sampling points may be randomly select i.e. a number 

of cells from the grid (typically sampling density ~ 20 per hectare) or collect a composite 

sample every 1-3 ha (Figure 4.1). A single sample from each sampling point is collected 

and then combined to form the bulk sample for the site.

Figure 4.1 – Scheme for composite samples. 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 38  
 

b) Sampling Regime 2 
Applicable to smaller, visually homogeneous, areas of soil. This could include, for 

example, a flowerbed in a small ornamental garden, or a single allotment. An area of ~ 1 

m2 is defined and a sample close to each of the corners of the square and one from the 

centre is collected and then combined to form the composite sample for the site. The area 

should, as far as possible, be typical of the site and removed from point sources of 

contaminants such as metal fence posts etc.  

c) Sampling Regime 3 
Applicable to areas such as roadsides and riverbanks, where it may be important to 

determine average soil quality along a length of the roadside or bank. A transect along a 

roadside or riverbank (e.g. ~ 50 m in length) is defined and a sample is taken from one or 

more sampling points (e.g. every ~ 10 m along the transect). Samples are then combined 

to form the bulk sample for the site.  

 

4.2. Sampling scheme and instructions 
After defining each one of the sampling points on the field, surface vegetation is removed. 

For each sample, a “site Sampling Record” (Annex I) is completed at the sampling site. 

This record has details on: sample identification, sample log record (sampling site name, 

date and time of collection, GPS coordinates, sampling conditions, relevant sample site 

observations, signature of the sample collector(s)) and chain of custody record (record of 

personnel handling samples on the field). Care should be taken to ensure that the 

proximity of road (distance from the road and traffic intensity) or another potential pollution 

source is indicated and described. A chain of custody record (record of personnel 

handling samples on the field) was also kept. Table 4.1 shows a resume of sampling 

procedures for different purposes. 

4.2.1 Procedure to collect urban soil samples 
• Use a stainless steel spade to dig the hole and plastics spades for sampling 

collection; 

• Take samples at two depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm); 

• Collect samples according to procedures described for inorganics (4.2.2) and 
organics (4.2.3); 

• Use GPS to register location of sampling sites; 

• Follow QC/QA directions for soil sampling: use of “Site Sampling Record” for each 
sample. 



 

GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 39 
 

Sample labelling and transport: 
Each site and each sampling depth has a unique code. A standard sampling code should 

be used, where the number is the number of the site. As an example, the first soil sample, 

for the 0-10 cm depth is labelled as “EST.OG.01.SF”, which stands for “Estarreja” (EST), 

“Ornamental Garden” (OG), site number 1 (01) and surface sample (SF). At the same site 

the subsurface sample (10-20 cm) is labelled as “EST.OG.01.SB”.  

Cleaning of tools: 
All sampling equipment was cleaned with distilled water and paper towels, between usages. 

Soil samples were handled using plastic gloves (except for organics). 

 

4.2.2 Sampling procedure for inorganics 
Around 2 kg of soil was taken from the 10 cm top layer with a plastic spade, and kept in a 

labelled plastic bag (Table 4.1). The same is done for the 10-20 cm layer. Samples were 

stored in plastic bags, labelled, placed in boxes and transported to the laboratory. 

4.2.3 Sampling procedure for organic compounds 
Plastics were avoided because phthalates, commonly used as plasticizers and easily 

extracted from plastic material, can interfere with results and therefore compromise all the 

analytical process. Moreover, samples were not collected or stored in the presence of 

exhaust fumes. 

 Around 500g of soil is collected with a stainless steel spade and immediately wrapped 

with aluminium foil (Table 4.1). The wrapped portion of soil was placed inside of a plastic 

bag guaranteeing that the sample would not be in touch with the bag and the container is 

then labelled. Samples were kept cool (~4 ºC), in the dark and transported to the 

laboratory as soon as possible after collection.

4.3. Estarreja soil sampling maps 
The digital cartography available was used to produce maps for sampling campaigns. 

Maps were produced on a GIS basis (ARCGIS 9.0®). These maps were used both to 

define sampling points (soil sampling protocols) and to present soil quality data. A GPS 

(Global Positioning System) was also used to input coordinates of sampled points on 

these maps.  

 Twenty six sites were sampled, at two depths, as it is shown in Figure 4.2. The land 

uses sampled were: ornamental gardens (OG), roadsides (RD), parks (PO) and 

agricultural (AG). As most roadsides in the urban area are subject of active planning and 

may also be considered ornamental gardens, another type of land use can be defined 

(Ornamental Garden/Roadsides (OG/RD). The number of samples collected for each one 
of the land uses is shown in Table 4.2. The initial choice of the sampling sites was 

followed, however, as sampling was accompanied by the Municipality staff it’s was just 

possible to sample were it was allowed. Due to this limitation in two sites (site 1 and 8) 

only the first depth was collected, resulting in a total of 50 samples. Besides, in what 

concerns agricultural sites sampling was subjected to an authorization of the land owner. 

In Annex II it’s presented a resume with the location and description of Estarreja soils 

sampling sites. Sampling campaign occurred during May of 2005.

4.4. Sample Pre-Treatment and Storage  
4.4.1 Sample pre-treatment and storage for inorganics 
The pre-treatment of samples was done in accordance to ISO method 11464:1994 (ISO, 

1994a). This International Standard specifies the pre-treatment required for soil samples 

that are to be subjected to physical-chemical analysis and describes the following five 

types of pre-treatment of samples: drying, crushing, sieving, dividing and milling.

 Soil samples were oven dried at 40 ºC as soon as arrived to laboratory to minimize 

microbial activity (mineralization). These samples were crushed while still damp and 

friable and again after drying, using a plastic hammer. Samples were thoroughly mixed 

and divided using the “cone-and-quarter” technique. The soil was sieved, with a nylon 

sieve, and the fraction smaller than 2 mm (10-mesh) was stored in the absence of light, 

for further analysis. Subsamples of 50g were taken from the fraction smaller than 2 mm, 

grinded (agate rings mill) and sieved to a fraction smaller than 150 ?m. The maximum 

holding time until analysis should not exceed 6 months (Table 4.1). 

 

4.4.2 Sample pre-treatment and storage for organic compounds 
For organics sample pre-treatment has special cares (USEPA, 1996a) Samples were 

delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection and dried in a cold and 

dark place for no longer then 2 days. Then a portion of each sample was sieved to&amp;lt;2 mm 

using a stainless steel sieve and frozen involved in aluminium foil. Samples should be 

extracted within 15 days of sampling (Table 4.1).

5.1. Introduction 
The following set of parameters was selected in order to obtain a general characterisation 

of Estarreja urban soils: soil pH in water (pHW) and in CaCl2 (pHCa), total C, N and H 

percentages, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable bases, organic matter 

content by Loss on Ignition (LOI) and particle size distribution (PSD).  

 Soil pH can be used as an indicator of the acidity or alkalinity in the soil. It has different 

sources and in natural systems the pH is affected by the mineralogy, climate, and 

weathering. The pH of a soil affects the availability of both the essential elements such as 

phosphorous (P), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc 

(Zn), as well as non essential elements, such as aluminium (Al) or other potentially toxic 

metals (Zhou et al., 2000).  

 Another important parameter to assess soils quality is soil organic matter (SOM) that 

comprises a variety of carbonaceous materials including humus, soil micro-organisms, 

plant and animal residues, coal, charcoal, coke and graphite (NEPC, 1999). Soil Organic 

Carbon (SOC) is the most abundant element of SOM and represents a significant 

component of the global carbon, being soil pool and processes important regulators of 

CO2 in the atmosphere (Konen et al., 2002). Other elements of SOM include nitrogen, 

oxygen, hydrogen, sulphur and phosphorous. The importance of SOM regards mainly due 

to its relevant role, together with pH, on trace metals mobility and bioavailability. In 

addition, SOM can interact strongly with many other organic compounds resulting in 

complexed species that shows altered reactivity (either enhanced or diminished), 

affecting, for example, the bioactivity, persistence and biodegrability of pesticides 

(Stevenson, 1982). It is also a source of hydrogen ions, through dissociation of acidic 

groups, and is therefore an environmental component which determines the bulk pH as 

well as the availability of protons.  

 Nutrients such as nitrogen (N), sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium 

(K) and sodium (Na) are originated from rock weathering and from atmospheric 

deposition. The amounts of nutrients supplied will therefore be dependent of local 

geology, rainfall and the proximity to the sea, sources of atmospheric pollution and 

atmospheric dust. The cations Ca, Mg, Na and K, are known as basic cations and they 

exist in soil primarily as exchangeable cations on the colloidal complex of the soil or they 

occur as simple inorganic salts (SPAC, 1999). The negative charges on clay and humus is 

balanced by charges on these cations and also by H+ and aluminium ions (Al3+, AlOH2+, 

Al(OH)2+) which are known as acidic cations (Wild, 1993). The ability of soil to yield 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 46  
 

cations is known as Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). This is, therefore, the measure of 

the readily exchangeable cations that neutralize negative charges of soil components, 

being important as source of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K and Na) and as buffer of pH.   

 Soil texture is also called particle or grain size distribution of particles constituting the 

soil (Boulding, 1994). The inorganic constituents of soil are sand, silt and clay, formed by 

weathering of parent rocks. Clay minerals together with SOM are particularly important 

from the environmental point of view due to their ability to adsorb ions, molecules and 

gases and therefore hold toxic pollutants.   

 Concluding, all these parameters are very important for assess soil function as they are 

responsible by providing nutrients to plants, contaminants mobility and water holding 

capacity. In addition, soil as sorptive characteristics, due to the electrical charges and 

large surface area of the clay mineral and humus (Wild, 1993). As a result, soil acts as 

buffer zone between the atmosphere and groundwater (Guvenç et al., 2003), and in an 

urban context this property is extremely important due to the high atmospheric inputs.  

 

5.2. Analytical methods and QC/QA procedures 
5.2.1 pHw and pHCa 
Samples pH was determined according to the ISO method 10390:1994 (ISO, 1994b) 

using a glass electrode (WTW, Sentix 41) both, in a 1:5 (m/v) suspension of soil in water 

(pHW) and in a solution of 0.01 mol/l calcium chloride (pHCa). Determination was 

undertaken in the &amp;lt;2 mm soil fraction, for both surface and subsurface layer in a total of 

50 samples. 

 A sub-sample of five grams of soil was taken to a centrifuge tube and it was added five 

times its volume of water or calcium chloride solution. Suspension was mixed using a 

mechanical shaker during 5 minutes, left for at least 2h, but no longer than 24 h. The pH 

determinations were performed twice, after 2 h and 20 h. Just before the determination of 

pH, the suspension was shaken thoroughly and the pH was measured in the settling 

suspension. The pH value was read after stabilization (pH value over a period of 5s does 

not vary more than 0.02 units). The pH-meter (WTW, mod. 538) was calibrated as 

prescribed in the manufacturer's manual, using buffer commercial solutions with pH 4.00 

and 7.00.

5.2.2 Elemental Analysis (C, N and H) 
Determinations were performed with an instrument for CHN microanalysis (LECO, CHNS-

932) that measures carbon and hydrogen by means of individual, infrared detection 

systems while nitrogen is measured in a thermal conductivity detector system. 

Determinations are undertaken directly in sub-samples of around 1 g of soil milled and 

sieved to&amp;lt;150 ?m, for both layers, being the total of samples analysed 50.  

 

5.2.3 Organic matter (OM) 
Total soil organic matter was estimated by measuring the weight loss due to the 

combustion (loss-on-ignition), upon heating at 430ºC according to Schumacher (2002). 

About ten grams of soil, sieved to&amp;lt;2 mm, were dried at 105 ºC for four hours to remove 

any residual water. Samples were then ashed at 430 ºC until constant weight (about 16 

hours), and then allowed to cool in a dessicator. Each sample was weighed, prior and 

after heating, and the decrease in weight was calculated as a proportion of the initial 

weight and expressed as a percentage weight loss. Determinations were done in both 

surface and subsurface samples in a total of 50 samples.  

 

5.2.4 Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) 
Potential CEC and exchangeable cations were determined in barium chloride solution 

buffered at pH = 8.1 using triethanolamine, following the principles of the ISO method 

13536:1995 (ISO, 1995a). The principle of this method consists in an initial saturation of 

the soil with a buffered barium chloride solution, followed by an addition of a known 

excess of magnesium sulphate solution that precipitates all the barium present (in solution 

as well as adsorbed, in the form of highly insoluble barium sulphate) and the sites with 

exchangeable ions are then readily occupied by magnesium. The excess magnesium is 

then determined by titration and sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium are 

determined in the barium chloride extract of the soil (exchangeable bases). 

Two grams of air-dried soil (&lt;2 mm fraction, surface layer) were weighted into a 

centrifuge tube and exactly 25 ml of the extraction solution was added to the sample. The 

extraction solution was prepared by dissolving 100 g of barium chloride dihydrate 

(BaCl2.2H2O) in about 800 ml of distilled water, adding 22.5 ml of triethanolamine 

(HOCH2CH2)3N, adjusting the pH at 8.1+/-0.1 with HCl (1:1 v/v) and diluting to 1000 ml. 

The barium-ions exchange with cations present in the soil. Sample was then shaken for 3 

min, rested for 5 min and shaken again for 3 min. The sample was centrifuged 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 48 

(3000rpmX5min) and the supernatant was transferred to a volumetric flask, diluted to 100 

ml, filtered (Whatman 54, Cat Nº1454, d=11cm, retention 20-25 mm, maximum ash per 

circle 0.05 mg) and preserved for analysis of the exchangeable cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, 

Ca2+).  

The precipitate was washed by adding 25ml of distilled water followed by 

centrifugation; after decantation of the supernatant to waste the precipitate was weighted 

to determine the water fraction present in the soil. The sample was then treated with 25 ml 

of 0.1M MgSO4, shaken for 5 min and after centrifugation (3000rpmX5min) the 

supernatant was filtered. Exactly 10ml were titrated with EDTA 0.05N. For titration, 10ml 

of extract were transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, approximately 10ml of the buffer 

solution NH3aq/NH4Cl (pH=10) and 20 ml of distilled water, were added. The indicator 

used was Eriochrome Black T added in an enough amount to produce wine-red colour. 

Solution was titrated with an EDTA standard solution to a clear blue colour. Calculations 

were performed by using the following formula:

5.2.5 Exchangeable Bases  
Exchangeable bases were determined according to the ISO method 13536:1995 (ISO, 

1995a). Sodium and potassium were measured in the acidified barium chloride-

triethanolamine extract of soil samples by flame emission spectrometry (FES, Model GBC 

series 906 AA). The calibration series used ranged from 0.3 to 3 mg/l for Na and from 

0.25 to 1.5 mg/l for K. Two millilitres of filtrate obtained (see point 5.2.4), 1 ml of HCl 1 

mol/l and 7 ml of water were added to a test tube and mixed. The same was done to the 

blank extract. Sodium was determined at 589 nm and potassium at 766 nm using an 

air/propane flame. 

Calcium and magnesium were determined in the acidified barium chloride 

triethanolamine extract by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS, Model GBC 

series 906 AA). The calibration series used ranged from 1 to 5 mg/l for both elements.

One millilitre of filtrate obtained (see point 5.2.4), 1 ml of HCl 1 mol/l and 8 ml of water 

were added to a tube and mixed. The same was done for the blank. Magnesium was 

determined at 285.2 nm using an oxidising (blue) air/acetylene flame and calcium at 422.7 

nm using reducing air/acetylene flame. Calculations were performed by using the

5.2.6 Particle Size Distribution (PSD) 
The determination of the PSD was performed through the analysis of main texture 

percentages: sand, silt and clay fractions. The determination of the sand fraction (2-0.075 

mm) was obtained by dry sieving using the 75 µm ASTM standard sieve. Sand (0.075-

0.050 mm), silt (0.050-0.002 mm) and clay (&lt;0.002 mm) fractions were quantified by using 

the Micromeritics® Sedigraph 5100. Around 3 g of each sample (from&amp;lt;0.075 mm 

fraction) were accurately weighed and 0.16 mM sodium hexametaphosphate solution was 

added. The solution was fully dispersed using an ultrasonicator in order to disperse 

sample aggregates. The sedigraph was cleaned using distilled water and calibrated using 

the Spectromelt A 12 (66% di-Lithium tetraborate/34% Litium metaborate) (1.5 ?m) 

reference material.  

 Each sample was then classified according to the percentages to the USDA classes by 

using the Talwin 42® classification software program. The classification was done only for 

SF layer in a total of 26 samples.

For the determination of exchangeable cations, the instrument was calibrated with five 

acidified standards and a standard was analyzed every five samples to check for 

instrument drift. Standards were prepared in an acidified barium chloride-triethanolamine 

solution in order to reduce matrix effects. Detection limits were estimated from the 

calibration curve as the concentration giving a blank signal, plus three standard deviations 

of the blank and they were found to be 0.09 mg/l for Ca, 0.15 mg/l for Mg, 0.18 mg/l for Na 

and 0.06 mg/l for K. 
 Difficulties were found in obtain a complete validation data for all analytes due to the 

lack of suitable certified reference materials (CRM). However, whenever possible, CRM’s 

were used. For Elemental Analysis (Total C, N) reference materials Eurovector E11036 

and Eurovector E11037 were analysed in the same way as samples and recoveries were 

found to be 94 ± 9% (STDEV) for Total Carbon (TC) and 105 ± 8 % (STDEV) for Total 

Nitrogen (TN). For CEC the reference material used was the Lufa Speyer 2.2, a loamy 

sand soil with a CEC of 11 ± 1 mval/100 g and recoveries were found to be 94 ± 4% 

(STDEV). Table 5.2 lists the methods used, the number of samples analysed and the

5.3. Results and discussion  
Descriptive statistics was initially performed on the data, histograms and box-plots were 

obtained and normality was tested by running the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (SPSS 11.0) 

(results are shown in Annex III). As not all parameters follow a normal distribution, non-

parametric statistics was used. Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was used for the 

comparisons between the two layers of urban soil, when applicable. All variables were 

then tested for correlations (for SF layer) and Principal Component Analysis (using 

STATISTICA® 6.0 software) was used to identify relationships between them, after log 

transformation of the original data. Finally, the influence of the land use was studied by 

using the Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks test. 

 

5.3.1 Characterization of physical and chemical properties of urban soils from 
Estarreja 

5.3.1.1 Soil reaction of Estarreja samples 
Summary statistics of pH determination for both, water and calcium chloride, in the two 

layers are shown in Table 5.3. For pHw the median value in surface layer (SF) was 6.21, 

ranging from 4.83 to 7.16, and in subsurface layer (SB) it was 6.09, ranging from 4.53 to 

8.15. The median value of pHCa for SF layer samples was 5.15, ranging from 4.08 to 6.88, 

and for SB layer this value was 4.91, ranging from 3.9 to 7.35. The results for pHCa is 

about 0.5 to 1.0 pH units lower than for water extract, due to the higher concentration of 

H+ ions in solution as a result of ion exchange with Ca2+ in soil particles. This method 

gives more precise values, being recommended where the salt content may influence the 

pH value. Nevertheless, just for classification purposes of the pHw in both layers, USDA 

[w13] classes will be used for setting the acidity and alkalinity limits as shown in Figure 5.2.

Differences between sample depths were observed for some individual samples but no 

general pattern was found, and when performing the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test 

differences were not statistical significant. Both, the lowest (sample 15.AG) and the 

highest value (sample 6.RD) of pH were found in the SB layer. In both cases the 

difference between the two layers is quite significant, yet in the second case the difference 

is even greater. 

According to the USDA classification soils having a pH less than 6.6 are classified as 

acidic, when is above 7.3 are alkaline and when between those values are neutral soils. 

From Figure 5.2 and Table 5.3 its possible to conclude that Estarreja soils are, in what 

concerns the median value, classified as slightly acid (6.1&lt;pH&lt;6.5), with most of the 

samples bellow the acidity upper limit. Following the USDA classification (Figure 5.3 and 

Figure 5.4), samples 18.AG (SF and SB) and 15.AG.SB are considered very strongly acid 

(4.5&lt;pH&lt;5.0), and samples 22.AG (SF and SB) and 9.OG/RD.SF are considered strongly 

acid (5.1&lt;pH&lt;5.5). On the other hand, samples 11.RD.SB and 26.AG.SB were classified 

as slightly alkaline (7.4&lt;pH&lt;7.8) and sample 6.RD.SB was considered moderately 

alkaline (7.9&lt;pH&lt;8.4).

Although non-natural soil alkalinity has been reported in urban soils, due to the release 

of calcareous solutions from building wastes (Jim, 1998), this was not verified in Estarreja. 

The main reason for the acidity reported in Estarreja soils is likely to be the soil type, 

however other factors such as atmospheric inputs from industry (especially HCl, HNO3, 

NH3, NH4+), gases from atmosphere (SO2, CO2), deposit of aerosols and the acidic rain 

may have some importance (Wild, 1993). Values of SO2 measured in the monitoring 

station of Estarreja (see point 3.4) are not very high (bellow the maximum value of 125 

µg/m3 daily base, with very few days exceeding this value) and the same was observed 

for NO2. However, as it is possible to observe in Table 3.4, the industry around Estarreja 

releases several tons of SOx and NOx. In addition, pH in rainwater for Aveiro region can be 

considered acid (about 5.4), being found values as low as 5.0 (Condesso de Melo, 2002).

classes [w13]. 
 

A pH range of 6 to 7 is generally most favourable for plant growth due to availability of 

nutrients (USDA - [w13]). These values were not observed in all Estarreja samples being 

either too low or too high. Samples 9.OG/RD.SF, 15.AG.SB, 18.AG, 20.AG.SB and 

22.AG.SF (pH&lt;5.5) or samples 6.RD.SB and 11.RD.SB (pH&gt;7.8) will show problems on 

nutrients availability either due to their high or low solubility. Another important effect of pH 

is the solubility of potentially toxic metals under acid conditions which can move 

downward with water through the soil, in some cases moving to aquifers or surface 

streams.  
 

5.3.1.2 Characterization of SOM and Total C, N and H in Estarreja soils 
OM was estimated by loss-on-ignition and results for each individual sample are shown in 

Table 5.4, together with results of total C, N and H. Figure 5.5 shows the box plots,

including the outliers and extreme values, for these parameters. For surface (SF) samples 

the median value of OM was 4.4 %, ranging from 1.8 to 8.9% and for subsurface (SB) 

samples the median value was 3.4%, ranging from 1.6 to 6.2% (Table 5.5). Therefore, 

considering the median, soils from SF layer can be considered as having a high content of 

OM (&gt;4%) and soils from SB layer have a medium content (4&lt;OM%&lt;2) (Boulding, 1994).  

The difference between the two layers was found to be statistically different (Mann-

Whitney Rank Sum Test, P=0.006), being the SF layer normally enriched in OM. In Figure 

5.5 and Figure 5.6 it is possible to observe these differences between layers and between 

sites, as well as samples that are above and bellow the median value. The enrichment 

factor of OM, the ratio between OM (%) in SF and SB (EF=SF/SB), was calculated for 

each sample and results (Table 5.4) shows that this ratio is equal or higher than one for all 

samples, reaching values as high as 2.7 (sample 6.RD).

In what concerns the percentages of total C, N and H, the median concentration was 

found to be higher in the SF layer than in the SB for the three parameters (Table 5.5), 

being the difference between the two layers statistically significant for all cases (Mann-

Whitney Rank Sum Test, P=0.002 for TC, P=0.014 for TN and P=0.019 for TH). These 

differences between layers and dispersion of results are displayed in Figure 5.5.

LOI is a proxy measurement of organic matter, being the ashes that remain inorganic 

particles. The method adopted is classified by EPA as semi-quantitative (Schumacker, 

2002). One of the problems of this method is the loss of carbonate carbon, to which 

carbonate soils are especially prone. Estarreja soils are not carbonated soils and in 

addition in soils with a pHCa less than 6.5 the presence of carbonates is unlikely (ISO, 

1995b). Moreover, as temperature was kept below 440 ºC, even if inorganic carbonates 

were present they would not be decomposed. In what concerns the loss of structural 

water from clay minerals, that can result in an overestimation of OM content (Schumacker, 

2002), it is not expected to interfere with results as Estarreja samples have low clay 

content.  

The calculation of the soils organic carbon (OC) from LOI is widely based on the 

assumption that a constant fraction of the dry LOI is OC (58%). However the use of such 

universal conversion factor may be linked to redundancy arising from various sources of 

error related to the nature or age of SOM (Westman et al., 2006). Estarreja soils are not 

carbonated and therefore TC can be considered equal to OC. Pearson correlation 

between SOM and TC, in SF layer, was found to be 0.862 (p&lt;0.05), meaning that the 

proportion of OC in SOM increases with the quantity of SOM (OC=0.46*SOM). For SB 

layer results were quite similar (Pearson correlation of 0.862 and the equation was 

OC=0.41*SOM). These results are in accordance with the range found by Westman et al. 

(2006) for podzolic soils (from 0.33 to 0.59). Values of OC in SOM above 55%, common in 

old soils (Craft et al., 1991), were found in samples 4.RD.SF, 5RD.SF, 7.OG/RD.SF and 

sample 12.OG/RD.SF (Table 5.4), which are roadsides covered with grass and known to 

be old. Values around 40%, which are typical of young soils with recently deposited plant 

material (Craft et al., 1991), were found mainly in ornamental gardens and agricultural 

sites.  

For Estarreja samples the median value of C/N ratio was 9.5 for SF layer and 9.0 for 

SB layer. Values are close to 10 indicating the presence of humus, with the lowest value 

(Table 5.4) found in sample 23.AG.SB (C/N=2.7) and the highest in sample 4.RD.SF 

(C/N=13.3). Values of about 10 are common for neutral well-drained agricultural soils 

through the world, but under wetter or more poorly drained conditions and under acid 

conditions this ratio is higher and may be as high as 17 (Russel, 1973).  

The median percentage of total N (0.2%) is not high, being bellow the normal values in 

warm humid regions of 0.3% (Tan, 1994), still some higher values were found (0.5% in 

sample 25.AG). These low results are in accordance with rainfall concentrations, in which 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS

annual average values of N-NO3 are reported to be 0.124 mg/l and 0.104 mg/l in two 

stations near Estarreja, Aveiro and Albergaria respectively (Condesso de Melo, 2002). 

Moreover, proximity to the sea, sources of atmospheric pollution and atmospheric dust 

(Wild, 1993) don’t seem to have some influence on the results as it should be expected.  

 

5.3.1.3  The CEC and exchangeable bases of Estarreja soils 
CEC is a reversible process in which one mol of cation charge in solution replaces 1 mol 

of cation charge on the exchanger and it is measured in centimols per kilogram (cmol/kg) 

or in milliequivalents per 100 grams (meq/100g). The median value of 11.1 cmol/kg (Table 

5.6) can be considered relatively low, according to EPA classes, that defines low values 

the ones bellow 12 cmol/kg and medium values between 12 and 20 cmol/kg (Boulding, 

1994). Considering the type of soil and the low pH values obtained for Estarreja samples, 

the CEC values obtained are according to what was expected. Still, in the study area 

values ranged from 5.3 to 19.4 cmol/kg (Table 5.6 and Figure 5.7). The lowest value was 

found in sample 11.RD.SF and the highest one in sample 14.PO.SF, following the same 

pattern of OM.  

Results of the exchangeable cations, including the summary statistics are shown in 

Table 5.6. Of the four cations Ca is the most abundant, with a median value of 4.8 

cmol/kg, followed by Mg (4.2 cmol/kg), then Na (0.5 cmol/kg) and at last, K with a median 

value of 0.1 cmol/kg and most of samples below detection limit. This difference between 

concentrations of exchangeable cations in Estarreja samples can be easily observed in 

Figure 5.7 and Figure 5.8, with the former showing the concentration of all four cations in 

each sample.  

The typical exchangeable cations distribution in well-farmed temperate soils is 80% of 

Ca, 15 % of Mg and Na and K together rarely more than 5% (Russel, 1973). In Estarreja, 

as it’s possible to observe in Figure 5.8, only sample 8.OG/RD is near these percentages 

(67%, 28% and 5%). Samples 2.OG, 5.RD, 7.OG/RD, 9.OG/RD, 14.PO, 16.OG, 21.AG, 

22.AG and 26.AG have more exchangeable Mg than Ca, what is typical in soils derived 

from magnesium-rich rocks or natural leached non-calcareous soils. Sample 25 showed 

very high contents of both CaExch and MgExch, being also the sample with highest CEC. 

The composition of exchangeable cations (EC) depends on the composition of 

weatherable minerals in the soil and their rate of weathering, mineral composition of the 

rain water, dust blown, addition of waste, fertilizer applications, aerosols deposition and 

irrigation (Russel, 1973; Yong et al., 1992).

Concentration of exchangeable Na is high in some Estarreja samples, being the 

highest value found in sample 9.OG/RD (2.59 cmol/kg). Some samples showed an 

exchangeable Na percentage (% of total exchangeable base content) above 15%, the 

threshold above which soils are considered to be sodium-affected (sodic) (Ellis &amp;amp; Mellor, 

1995). This may be happening in samples 9.OG/RD (56% of Na), 10.RD (16.5% of Na), 

18.AG (31.2% of Na) and 24.AG (16.7% of Na). Na is toxic to many species and it has a 

deleterious effect on soil structure, because aggregation of clay particles does not occur 

and therefore soil particles are dispersed giving adverse physical conditions (Wild, 1993). 

One explanation for these high values may be the high concentration of Na in rainwater, 

as the level of Na can be controlled by this factor (Russel, 1973). The local rainfall has 

annual averaged Na/Cl ratios of 1.21, close to the characteristic value for the seawater 

0.85, and reflecting marine aerosol (Condesso de Melo et al., 2002). The relative high 

percentage of Mg found in samples may also be an indication of a marine influence. 

Results may also be affected by the parent material (sand dunes) or can be influenced by 

free sodium salts. Data about salinity should have been measured from the electrical 

conductivity, in order to determine how far this parameter is influencing the results.  

In calcareous soils, the sum of the cations (? Ca, Mg, K, and Na) is invariable equal to 

CEC since any deficit of the cations on the exchanger can be made up by Ca2+ ions from 

the dissolution of CaCO3. In non-calcareous soil, which is the case of Estarreja, this sum 

is frequently lower than the CEC, being the difference referred as exchange acidity (in 

cmol H+/kg soil). The exchange acidity is mainly due to Al3+ ions that can be displaced by 

leaching with strong salt solution. In some cases the sum of exchangeable cations in 

Estarreja soils was found to be higher than the CEC, meaning that probably soluble salts 

were present in soil samples. Therefore, a pre-wash with aqueous ethanol or glycerol 

should have been made to remove soluble salts. As a result, in these samples (3.OG/RD, 

5.RD, 7.OG/RD, 12OG/RD, 19.AG, 20.AG, 25.AG and 26.AG) the percent of base 

saturation (%BS = ?EC/CEC) is higher than 100. This way, %BS and exchangeable 

acidity was calculated for all samples except these ones (Table 5.6). Considering these 

results, the lowest value of %BS was found in sample 22.AG (28.7%) and the highest one 

in sample 11.OG/RD (95.6%). For exchange acidity results ranged from 0.4 cmol H+/kg, in 

sample 23.AG, to 7.4 cmol H+/kg in sample 14.PO. 

5.3.2 Estarreja soil’s texture 
The determination of the particle size distribution (PSD) of Estarreja surface samples was 

performed and the main texture percentages were obtained: sand, silt and clay fractions.

Page 64 

Figure 5.9 shows that the dominant fraction is sand, followed by silt and with a very low 

percentage the clay. Figure 5.10 shows the percentages of each fraction for individual 

samples. Samples are predominantly coarse textured with sand particles exceeding 70% 

by weight in 13 samples. The highest total fine fraction content was 58% for sample 

14.PO (silt loam) and the lowest was 14% for sample 11.RD (sand). All other samples are 

classified as sandy loam or loamy sand.

Samples were classified according to the percentages of the USDA soil texture classes 

(USDA - [w13]). This was achieved using the Talwin 42® classification program which 

classifies the texture class of each sample according to the respective sand and fine 

fraction percentages. Figure 5.11 shows all 26 Estarreja surface samples, plotted in the in 

the triangular diagram according with the USDA classification system. Although most of 

the samples fell in the same texture class, it is possible to distinguish the four classes: 

sand, sandy loam, loamy sand and silt loam. The majority of Estarreja samples (16 

samples) are classified as sandy loam, eight samples are classified as loamy sand, one 

as silt loam and one as sandy.

Figure 5.10 – Percentages of each fraction in individual samples. 

 

The results of PSD in Estarreja samples can be explained by the local geology and soil 

type. One of the problems associated with the light texture of soils is that the shortage of 

fine particles limits the formation of a strong soil structure due to the lack of aggregating 

agents and bridging materials between coarse grains. Texture is also responsible for the 

fraction of available water and in this case soils are very permeable allowing water 

infiltration and drainage. According to USDA, the fraction of available water is less than 

0.1 for sands, loamy sands and sandy loams in which the sand is not dominated by very 

fine sand. For loamy sands and sandy loams in which very fine sand is the dominant sand 

fraction, and loams, clay loam, sandy clay loam and sandy clay is 0.1 – 10.15.

5.3.3 Application of multivariated analysis to Estarreja soil’s general parameters  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in order to identify relationships 

between the studied variables. Therefore, eigenvalues extracted are presented in Figure 

5.12. The first four factors were considered as they have eigenvalues higher than unit and 

explain 83% of the data, being only the first one responsible for 46.7%. Table 5.7 shows 

the factor loadings (with the ones higher than 0.5 marked in bold) the percentage of 

explained variance and the cumulative explained variance.  

By observing Table 5.7 and Figure 5.13, were the projection of the first factorial plan is 

represented, its possible to conclude that the first factor is loaded by the variables OM, 

CEC, TH, TC, TN, silt, MgExch and CaExch in opposition to sand. The second factor is 

loaded by the pH followed by the KExch. However CaExch and MgExch are explained by 

both factors. The factorial plan defined by the first two factors contains 63.8% of the total 

information of the correlation matrix, explaining 11 of the 14 variables.

whereas other soil properties such as TN, CaExch and MgExch seem to be associated 

among them and separated from the first group by the second factor. As it was expected 

sand showed a negative correlation with all this parameters. On the other hand, the pH 

showed an anomalous behaviour, has it is widely know to be dependent on the OM and 

CEC content. However, pH showed significant positive correlations with CaExch, MgExch 

and KExch, explaining the position of the first two parameters in the plot of the first factor 

plane (Figure 5.13). Moreover, the %BS is crudely correlated with soil pH (Pearson 

correlation of 0.661, p&lt;0.05), what is expected for mildly acid and neutral soils (Ellis &amp;amp; 

Mellor, 1995). In what concerns to total N, it is known that it increases with pH (Russel, 

1973), however any significant correlation was found. Nevertheless the highest values 

were found in samples 25.AG.SF and 23.AG.SB, which have a high pH value.  

Distribution of factor-scores, indicating the relative strength of the first factor (explained 

variance of 46.52%) in each sample is given in Figure 5.16. The positive anomalies on the 

first factor score map (Figure 5.16) indicate the high contribution of OM, CEC, TCNH, silt, 

CaExch and MgExch. Samples in which these parameters are having a highest 

contribution are sample 6.RD, 14.PO and 25.AG. The negative anomalies represent 

samples that have a high contribution of sand and they seem to have a similar distribution 

over the study area. On the other hand the positive anomalies are located mainly in the 

city centre. Distribution of factor scores of the second factor is not shown as the 

distribution was found to be similar over the study area, indicating that the high content in 

MgExch, CaExch and KExch is a characteristic of most Estarreja soils. 

These results, together with the scatter of all sampling points plotted on the first 

factorial plane (Figure 5.17), turn it possible to extract some conclusions about 

characteristics of each sample. It can be highlighted the position of sample 11.RD, which 

has very specific characteristics, being classified as sandy, with a neutral pH and very low 

content of OM, TCNH, CEC and exchangeable cations. Sample 14.PO and 25.AG are 

plotted in opposite sides, and also isolated from the others. This fact is due to differences 

in the texture, as sample 14.PO is classified as silt loam and sample 25.AG as sandy 

loam (however, very close to be classified as loam, Figure 5.11). Both samples have very 

high contents of OM, TCNH and CEC however sample 25 is neutral with higher content of 

exchangeable cations and probably soluble salts (Table 5.6) and on the other hand 

sample 14 is acidic, with lower content on exchangeable cations. These differences 

explain that they are separated by the second factor, responsible for the pH and KExch.  



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 70 

Sample 26.AG and 9.OG/RD, are plotted in opposite sides (Figure 5.17), mainly due to 

the neutral pH and highest value of KExch (and other cations) in sample 26.AG and the 

acidity and low KExch (bellow detection limit) for sample 9.OG/RD. These samples are 

separated by the first factor and, as OM and CEC are low for both, the major difference is 

TN and in the content of exchangeable cations, being the value of TN for sample 26 one 

of the highest found (Table 5.4 and Figure 5.6). In what concerns the exchangeable 

cations, sample 9.OG/RD has very low concentration of Ca and Mg, but the highest value 

of Na (Figure 5.8 and Table 5.6). Samples 22.AG and 18.AG, that shows low values of 

exchangeable cations and low pH, form a cluster with sample 9.RD.

The ratio C/N is explained only by the third factor (10.36% of explained variance), in 

opposition to NaExch. The scatter of sampling points plotted on the second factorial plane 

is shown in Figure 5.18. Sample 26.AG, as for the first factorial plan is isolated from all 

others, being in this case due to the low value of C/N. Samples 9.OG/RD, 10.RD, 18.AG 

and 24.AG have a C/N ratio close to 10, but they have high percentages of Na, being 

classified as sodic samples. In Figure 5.18 it’s possible to see that they form a cluster, 

however sample 10 is separated by the fist factor due to its highest content in OM. 

Another group can be easily identified, which is formed by samples 2.OG, 3.OG/RD, 4.RD 

and 6.RD. All these samples have C/N ratios equal or higher than 10 and OM content 

near or above the median. No correlation or association was found between the pH and 

C/N ratio, however the lowest value of C/N ratio was found in sample 23.AG.SB that has a 

pH value of 7.2, the same pattern was found for sample 26.AG.

The fourth factor is the only one that explains the clay parameter but it also explains, in 

opposition to this one, the NaExch and KExch. Therefore it’s easy to understand the 

position of sample 8.OG/RD in the scatter plot of the cases for the third factorial plan 

(Figure 5.19). This sample has the highest percentage in clay and very low NaExch and 

KExch, being this an OG it’s probable that it is a foreign soil. However, similar

 Physical characteristics of samples seem to be very important parameters which also 

influence other characteristics such as OM and CEC. Thus, heavy-textured soils (high 

contents of clay) have higher organic matter contents than loamy soils, which in turn have 

higher organic matter contents than sandy soils (Stevenson, 1982). In Estarreja most of 

soils sampled showed textures between loamy sand or sandy loam, resulting in a medium 

value of overall OM and CEC contents. Retention of substances may also be affected by 

the type of clay mineral present, although this was not studied.  

One of the problems associated with sandy soils is that the shortage of fine particles 

limits the formation of a strong soil structure due to the lack of aggregating agents and 

bridging materials between coarse grains. The lack of organic matter will intensify this 

problem and soils fail to develop the granular or crumb structures normally developed in 

natural and agricultural topsoil (Jim, 1998), being example samples 11.RD, 18.AG and 

22.AG. On the other hand, in soils with low clay content, an increase in SOM improves 

aggregation of soil particles, resulting in the development of stable soil structures 

(Huinink, 1998). It also increases the CEC, the water holding capacity, the soil’s nutrient 

content, especially N and S, affecting the fertility (Tan, 1994). In this study two cases of 

the texture influence on other soil properties can be addressed. The first one is sample 

14, classified as silt loam, shows the highest percentage of OM, low pH, high % of TN, 

TC, TH and high CEC and exchangeable acidity as it was expected according to the 

texture. The second one is sample 11 which results are according to the expected in what 

concerns the texture (sand): high pH, the lowest % of OM, TN, TC and TH, the lowest 

CEC and exchangeable acidity and a percent base saturation of 95.5 %.  

Another important parameter affecting soils properties is soil pH. One of the main 

functions of soil is its buffering capacity of pH due to several properties (Wild, 1993): 

reactions of acids with calcium and magnesium carbonates; cation exchange; proton 

adsorption by clay minerals, humus, and hydrated aluminium and iron oxides; proton 

adsorption by aluminium ions; solubilization of soil minerals. As a result of soil’s 

acidification their capacity to adsorb cations is reduced and nutrient cations, especially Ca 

and Mg, pass into solution and are leached in drainage water and the basic cations are 

replaced by protons and aluminium ions. If the basic cations losses are uptake by plants 

they can be returned to soil in litter or on the death of plants. C/N is an estimation of 

humus and humus is a source of exchangeable ions, therefore if there are no basic 

cations sufficient enough to balance the negative charge of humus the pH will decease 

(Wild, 1993). Another important implication of soil’s pH is on the activity of micro-



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 74  
 

organisms, that is responsible for breaking down organic matter and most chemical 

transformations in the soil, but the pH must be favourable for microbial activity which is not 

observed in most of Estarreja soils. In this way, pH is an important parameter to be 

measured in all quality assessment studies. 

From the PCA results it can be defined a minimum data set of parameters to be 

determined in environmental quality assessments. In this case, and having in account the 

more important parameters affecting each factor, the following can be selected: pH, 

texture and TCNH. The parameters analysed are more or less related between them, 

being the texture probably the most important one affecting OM and CEC. The pH results 

can be an indication of base saturation, however in soils under marine influence Na can 

be at anomalous concentrations. From the Total C, N and H results, which are very simple 

to determine, it’s possible to have an estimation of OM (for non carbonated soils) and C/N 

ratio. However, the relationship between OM and organic carbon is not equal in all soils, 

and therefore the estimation of OM by LOI, which is very simple and cheap, can be helpful 

and improve the data set of a quality assessment. Furthermore, the data set chosen 

should depend on the study aims. For example, texture that is an indicator of other soil 

properties, by itself it cannot be used to estimate the ability of soil to adsorb cations from 

solution, as it depends on the mineralogy of the clay fraction as well as on the amount and 

nature of OM (Wild, 1993).  

 

5.3.4 Effects of land use on indicators selected 
In order to detect differences between land uses Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of 

Variance on Ranks test was performed. Table 5.8 shows the median values for each 

parameter by land use, the samples classified as OG/RD were now classified only as OG 

due to the management that they are submitted. 

 Parks and ornamental gardens were expected to have an accumulation of organic 

matter (Schraps &amp;amp; Baumgarten, 2000), however, analysis of variance showed that 

differences between land uses are not statistically different. Still, the median value of 

%OM in parks was found to be the highest (7.2%) while agricultural sites, together with 

OG showed the lowest median values of OM (Table 5.8). The agricultural samples also 

show a smaller difference between layers, as it’s possible to see by the enrichment factor 

obtained for each sample (Table 5.5). It is usual to find low values of organic matter in 

agricultural soils with crop rotation and losses are known to be more or less linear with 

time, and ultimately it will reach an absolute minimum, approaching zero (Stevenson, 



 

 

   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 75 
 

1982). Moreover, the C/N ratio, that is an indication of humus, showed statistically 

significant differences (One-Way ANOVA), in surface layers, between Agricultural sites 

and Roadsides. Soils carrying out natural vegetation, such as forest (sample 14.PO), 

typically have high humus content both because they have a higher rate of addition of OM 

and the soil is not disturbed. Moreover the level of OM in soils is determined by the rates 

of addition and oxidation of plant residues and of soil humus, topography, parent material 

and the age of soil (Stevenson, 1982).

The median values of CEC seem to be different among land uses (Table 5.8), however 

no statistical difference between them were observed. The lowest median values of 

CaExch and MgExch were found in agricultural sites, what may be due to the removal of 

nutrients in harvested crops. The highest value of KExch and total N was found in an 

agricultural site (samples 26.AG and 25.AG), that may be an indication of sewage sludge 

application. It is also known that in agricultural soils the amount of cations applied in 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 76  
 

fertilisers, lime or manures to land may have some influence on the composition of 

exchangeable cations (Russel, 1973).  

Regarding the pH values it is known that the management of soils may alter the natural 

pH because of acid-forming nitrogen fertilizers, or removal of bases like potassium, 

calcium and magnesium. However no differences were found between land uses, the 

lowest pH value was found an agricultural site, but also the highest one, being the low pH 

values a characteristic of all Estarreja soils.  

Effects of land use in texture and the geology of area couldn’t be statistically proved. 

As in other cases, median values show some differences between the land uses, being 

the highest one for agricultural soils and the lowest one for parks.  

In addition to this analysis, the scatter plot of sampling points on factorial plane, 

together with factor-scores map, can be an easy way to observe samples characteristics 

and conclude whether they are suitable for purpose or they should be subjected on any 

kind of management to improve their quality. For example, the low content of clay mineral 

allied to low C/N ratios will diminish soil physical conditions for plant growth. 

 

5.4. Conclusions 
Estarreja urban soils can be characterized as slightly acid, with medium to high contents 

in organic matter and total carbon, being the surface layer enriched with OM. The CEC 

values are low, and the low nutrient status turn this soils very infertile. Some samples 

showed very high percentages of NaExch, probably reflecting rainwater influence. 

Concerning the texture, Estarreja urban soils can be classified as sandy loam or loamy 

sand. Therefore, a high percentage of sand seems to be a natural feature of the studied 

area, however inner the city centre, which are mainly ornamental gardens, there is a slight 

difference, probably due to the introduction of foreign soils.  

 Physical characteristics of samples seem to be an important factor that influences other 

soil parameters. The presence of samples with very different texture classes, sandy and 

silt loam can reflect the impact of this parameter in OM and CEC content. Moreover, 

general parameters characterized were in accordance with the expected results due to 

soil type and management practices.  

The pH is also an indicator that can influence other soil parameters, even that in this 

study this relationship was not so evident, probably because there is a low variability of pH 

in the set of sampling sites. The pH is especially important in what concerns nutrients 

availability and the solubility of potentially toxic metals. Soils from Estarreja are also 



 

 

   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 77 
 

known to have high permeability, representing a threat for aquifers or surface streams, as 

soils cannot perform their role as sink of pollutants.  

 From the PCA results a minimum data set of parameters for environmental quality 

assessments can be selected: the pH, texture and Total C and N. Moreover, soil texture is 

an important property from which many other soil parameters can be estimated or 

inferred. However, used alone it can have limited predictive values, depending on the 

purpose. In addition, CEC is also important because of nutrients availability and indication 

of the buffer capacity of soil.

6.1. Introduction 
Trace elements are introduced into soil from both natural and anthropogenic sources. 

Major and trace elements in parent rocks may be included in the formed soil fractions or 

by atmospheric deposition of particles emitted from natural sources such as forest fires, 

volcanic activity and biogenic emissions (Alloway, 1995; Guvenç et al., 2003). However, 

anthropogenic activities disturb the natural distribution of elements in soils.  

 Agriculture is one of the most important sources of metals in soils (especially Pb, Cd, 

Zn and Hg), by application of pesticides, fertilizers, sewage sludge or due to irrigation 

water taken from polluted streams (Wild, 1993; Alloway, 1995). Potentially toxic metals 

(PTM), mainly Hg, Cu, Zn and Cd, are also commonly found in soils of areas where ore 

extraction and smelting occurred (Alloway, 1995). Domestic waste disposal, motorways 

and urban areas are other important sources of PTM in the environment (Koeleman et al., 

1999; Bityuoka et al., 2000, Norra &amp;amp; Stüben, 2003), being in the last case the deposition 

of atmospheric particles over the years of major importance. There are also many studies 

showing the enrichment of heavy metals in soils around industrial sites (Bityukova et al., 

2000; Peltola &amp;amp; Åström, 2003). For example, steel industry is the main source of Cr and 

Ni, the manufacture of batteries of Cd and Pb and zinc plating factories of Zn. Emissions 

from chlor-alkali industry were during decades one of the major sources of Hg into the 

environment, however the development of new technology resulted in a decrease of 

emissions. Other important uses of metals include (Wild, 1993; Tan, 1994): pigment paints 

(Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg), for covering electrical cables (Pb), manufacture of plastics, glasses and 

glazes (Pb, Cd), as a filter in rubber and tyres (Zn), metal coating and alloys (Zn, Cd) and 

batteries (Zn, Cd). Hg has also been widely used for making thermometers, vapour and 

fluorescence lamps (Tan, 1994).  

PTM may exist in soil in a number of forms including as adsorbed cations, attached to 

clay aluminosilicates and humus colloids, oxides of Fe, Mn and Al and organo-metallic 

chelates (Wild, 1993). Mobility of elements in soil is largely controlled by their solubility in 

water (Barradas et. al., 1992). Furthermore, bioavailability to plants depends on a number 

of soil characteristics, particularly cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, organic matter 

content (OM), speciation of elements and the interdependence effects of other metals 

(Vangrosveld et al., 1996). Moreover they enter the food chain either through water 

supplies and aquatic organisms, or through agriculture products and grazing animals. In 

addition, PTM have long residence time in soils. The effects of PTM in soils on human 

health are unclear, and it’s therefore difficult to establish threshold concentrations above 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 82  
 

which toxic problems are likely to occur. For example, Cd it is known to cause renal and 

testicular damage and Pb is implicated in causing liver damage (Tan, 1994). Mercury is 

one of the most important pollutants, due to its toxicity to man and many higher animals 

and the predisposition to accumulate in different environments (bioconcentration potential) 

(Lindberg, 1998; Manta et al., 2002). Nerveless, some metals such as Cu, Mn and Zn are 

micronutrients which are essential in small amounts for plant and animal life, but due to 

human activities or natural causes they can be present in anomalous concentrations and 

may become toxic (Ellis &amp;amp; Mellor, 1995). 

This chapter aims to assess the quality of urban soils from Estarreja, by using PTM as 

indicators, and therefore discriminate natural and anthropic contributions as well as point 

and non-point sources of contamination. The pseudo-total content of PTM was chosen as 

indicator because it provides more useful information than a total analysis as residual 

components are usually less available and therefore pose a little threat to the 

environment. At the end it will be identified the main factors controlling metals distribution 

in soils (natural causes, industry, traffic).  
 

6.2. Methodology 
Concentrations of eight potentially toxic metals (Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr, Fe and Mn) were 

determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (Model GBC series 906 AA) after 

digestion with Aqua Regia. One gram of sample (weighed to the nearest 0.001 g) was 

digested with Aqua Regia (3 ml hydrochloric acid, 37% + 1 ml nitric acid, 65%) in a Teflon 

baker. The mixture was gently heated on a hotplate at 100°C until dryness. After this, 10 

ml of HNO3 4N were added to the Teflon vessels and the solution was transferred to a 25 

ml volumetric flask and made up to volume with demineralised water. Solutions were 

centrifuged (5min at 4000 rpm) and filtrated by means of MN 640 filter papers to 50 ml 

PVC flasks. When it was necessary, dilutions were made by adding 9 ml of HNO3 4N to 1 

ml of solution.  

The determination of total Hg concentrations was performed by pyrolysis atomic 

absorption spectrometry with gold amalgamation (LECO model AMA-254), being the 

analyses performed directly on soil samples.  

Determinations of all metals were undertaken in the&amp;lt;150 ?m fraction for both surfaces 

in a total of 50 samples.

6.2.1 Quality control 
For the determination of potentially toxic metals, the instrument was calibrated with five 

acidified standards and a standard was analyzed every ten samples to check for 

instrument drift. The calibration series used ranged from 0.25 to 5 mg/l for Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, 

Mn and Ni, from 2.5 to 50 mg/l for Fe and from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/l for Cd. The calibration 

solutions were prepared in the same extraction solution as the samples in order to remove 

the matrix effect. Detection limits were estimated from the calibration curve as the 

concentration giving a blank signal, plus three standard deviations of the blank. Table 6.1 

shows the limits of detection (LOD) and percent recoveries of certified reference material 

for each metal analysed. 

For quality assurance 3 replicate blanks were analysed and results were bellow 

detection limit for all parameters. Precision was evaluated by calculating variation 

between duplicate analyses, therefore 10% of samples were digested and analysed in 

duplicate being the relative standard deviation (RSD) bellow 10% for all replicates. All 

mercury determinations were made in duplicate and RSD was also bellow 10 % for all 

replicates. 

Two reference materials were used: BCR 141R, calcareous loam soil and BCR 142R, 

light sandy soil. Reference materials were subject to Aqua Regia digestion, except for 

mercury, following the same procedure of samples.

6.3. Results and Discussion 
6.3.1 Concentrations of potentially toxic metals in Estarreja urban soils 
Results of PTM concentration in each sample, together with histograms and results of the 

normality test Kolmogorov-Smirnov are shown in Annex IV. By performing the normality

test it was possible to conclude that Pb, Ni, Cd, Mn, Cr (in SB layer) and Fe (in the SB 

layer) have a normal distribution, and when looking to values of mean, median and 

skewness (Table 6.2), they seem to be uniformly distributed over the study area. On the 

other hand, Cu, Zn, Hg, Cr (in SF layer) and Fe (in the SF layer) do not have a normal 

distribution. This, together with other properties like high standard deviations, positive 

skewness and median values much lower than the mean, are characteristics that can be 

qualitative indicators of an anthropogenic origin of these elements (Guvenç et al., 2003). 

Mercury is the most evident case suggesting anthropogenic sources, with the highest 

coefficient of variation and with three extreme values, being this element one of the most 

important problems of the studied area. Zn and Cu also show differences over 15 times 

between minimum and maximum concentrations and values extend far beyond the 

median. By observing Figure 6.1, which shows the box plots obtained for each element in 

both layers, it’s possible to observe the differences between elements concentration, the 

dispersion of results (with the outlier values and extreme values) and differences between 

layers.  

Median values were found to be similar for surface (SF) and subsurface layers (SB) for 

all metals, but slightly higher values were found in the SF layer for Zn, Cr and Mn. A t-test, 

for Mn, Pb, or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, for Fe, Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu and Hg, was 

performed and in all cases it was not found any statistically significant difference between 

the two layers. Differences between layers for each individual sampling site can be 

observed in Figure 6.2, Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4. 

Zn showed a median value of 59.3 mg/kg for SF layer and 47.6 mg/kg for SB layer. 

The minimum value was found in sample 11.RD.SB (15.41 mg/kg) and the maximum 

value was found in sample 14.PO.SF (284 mg/kg in SB). Moreover, samples 11.RD and 

14.PO were the samples showing, respectively, the lowest and the highest concentration 

of all metals. 

In what concerns Cd, most of results were bellow detection limit being quantified only 

15 samples. The median values were 0.61 and 0.51 mg/kg for SF and SB layers, 

respectively, being the minimum concentration 0.20 mg/kg, found in sample 15.AG.SF 

and the maximum 1.73 mg/kg, found in sample 10.RD.SF. Cu showed a median 

concentration of 28.4 mg/kg in the SF layer and a very similar value in SB layer (26.0 

mg/kg), with a minimum of 8.9 mg/kg in sample 5.RD.SF and a maximum of 111 mg/kg in 

sample 10.RD.SF.

Hence, it’s possible to conclude in a first instance that concentrations of PTM in 

Estarreja urban soils are low, with some sites showing higher concentrations probably due 

to point source contamination. 

Barradas (1992) studied the geochemistry of the area near the chemical complex and 

found median concentrations (total content) of 18 mg/kg for Cu, 106 mg/kg for Zn, 53 

mg/kg for Pb, 21 mg/kg for Ni, 19 mg/kg for Cr and 2.0 mg/kg for Cd. Batista et al., (2002) 

found similar median total concentrations around the industrial area (16 mg/kg of Cu, 48 

mg/kg of Pb, 84 mg/ kg of Zn, 21 mg/kg of Ni and 20 mg/kg of Cr). Barradas (1992) 

concluded that Pb, Zn and Cu have an anthropogenic origin, being the background 

estimated of 20 mg/kg for Cu, 60 mg/kg for Pb and 130 mg/kg for Zn. Figure 6.3 shows 

which samples are above the background estimated for these metals, being Cu the most 

problematic element, with many samples above this value, and for Zn and Pb only a few 

samples are above the background. In order to estimate the enrichment of the city with 

respect to the background estimated for these metals, a Pollution Index (PI=mean 

Estarreja/mean background) were calculated. Only Cu showed a value higher than one, 

being the ratio for this metal 2.14.

In the particular case of total Hg, median concentration obtained for SF layer was 0.20 

mg/kg and for SB layer 0.18 mg/kg ranging from 0.05 (samples 11.RD and 13.PO) to 4.53 

mg/kg (sample 25.AG.SF). These values are lower than the ones found in previous 

studies of soils in the vicinity of the chemical complex (within an area of 10x6 km2), where 

a median value of 0.59 mg/kg was found, ranging from 0.12 to 49 mg/kg. However, the 

highest values were found near the complex and lowest values (lower than 0.59 mg/kg) 

were observed in more distant areas, being comparable with the ones found in this study 

(Inácio et al., 1998). On the other hand, concentrations of Hg in Estarreja are higher than 

concentrations found in Aveiro urban area, a bigger town (73 5000 inhabitants) 15 km 

away from Estarreja, were a median value of 0.09 mg/kg, ranging from 0.01 to 0.6, was 

found (Rodrigues et al., 2006). Therefore, and considering the median concentration of Hg 

in Aveiro urban soils as background, the PI of Estarreja, in what concerns Hg, is 5.34. 

In order to better understand the meaning of the results obtained they should be 

compared with the maximum acceptable limits established and with other case-studies. 

When comparing values obtained for Estarreja with other studies its possible to conclude 

that median concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cr are lower than values found in other cities 

like Wolverhampton (Kelly &amp;amp; Thornton, 1996), Tallin (Bityukova et al., 2000) or than 

Palermo (Manta et al., 2002) (Table 6.3). However these are bigger cities, for e.g. 

Wolverhampton, in UK, has 175,000 inhabitants and Estarreja has only 28,000 in the 

entire municipality. On the other hand, smaller cities like Jakobstad, an industrialized town 

with 20,000 inhabitants in west Finland where topsoil samples were found to be enriched 

in most elements (Peltola &amp;amp; Åström, 2003), showed concentrations comparable with 

Estarreja, which has some elements showing higher median concentrations (Table 6.3). 

Nevertheless, the range of results is in general much higher in other cities than for 

Estarreja showing the existence of few hotspots or point sources of pollution.  

Mercury in Estarreja seems to be the most problematic pollutant, especially when 

compared with other cities. The average mercury concentration in soils over the world 

(Manta et al., 2002) is reported to be from 50 to 100 µg/kg, and Estarreja showed a 

median concentration two times greater than the max mean value. Moreover, 

concentration of Hg in Estarreja is higher than in Berlin urban area (Birke &amp;amp; Rauch, 2000), 

Jacobstad (Peltola &amp;amp; Åström, 2003) or Antalya (Guvenç et al., 2003). Higher 

concentrations are reported in soils from urban locations like Palermo (Manta et al., 2002) 

and close to sources of Hg pollution (smelting, mining, coal burning facilities, chloralkali 



 

 

   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 91 
 

industry, etc). For example, Bernaus et al. (2006) reported values as high as 1150 mg/kg 

in the surroundings of a chlor-alkali plant in the Netherlands.  

Nevertheless, concentrations of PTM will be dependent of pedo-lithological conditions, 

being difficult to compare with other locals with different parent materials. For example, 

background levels of lead are reported to be less 100 mg/kg in uncontaminated soils (in 

Britain) (Ellis &amp;amp; Mellor, 1995), however the mean ranges from soils over the world are from 

22 to 44 mg/kg (Manta et al., 2002), and in France the reference values are 31 mg/kg. In 

the particular case of Estarreja, were the underlaying rocks are mainly sandy rocks, it is 

expected very low levels of trace elements as result of dissolution and chemical 

weathering (Bityokova et al., 2000). Other problems when comparing studies may be 

differences in sample collection or determination methods (e.g. total vs. pseudo-total 

content).

In Portugal there are only guidelines for agricultural soils, but for example guideline 

values for Québec and for Italy may be used, as they are both specific for residential and 

recreational soils. The Dutch guidelines define the Target Value (TV) as the baseline

to affect the natural properties of the soil. Guidelines existing in several countries are 

shown in Table 6.4.

Considering the target values from Netherlands, it was found that 11 sites sampled 

were above this value for Cu (01.RD, 03.OG/RD, 06.RD, 08.OG/RD, 09.OG/RD, 10.RD, 

14.PO, 15.AG, 16.OG, 17.AG and 25.AG), 4 sites for Zn (10.RD, 14.PO, 25.AG and 

26.AG), 6 sites for Cd (7.OG/RD 8.OG/RD, 9.OG/RD, 10.OG/RD, 14PO, 16.OG) and 7 

sites for Hg (10.RD, 14.PO, 15.AG, 16.OG, 24.AG and 25.AG). Regarding the land use, 6 

samples from residential areas (6, 8, 9, 10, 14 and 16) and 2 samples from agricultural 

sites (15 and 17) are above the Canadian Guidelines for Cu and/or Zn. Samples 15, 24 

and 25 show values of mercury above the Portuguese legislation for agricultural sites. 

 

6.3.2 Application of multivariated analysis to PTM results 
PCA was applied to soil data to obtain some factors that summarize geochemical 

information aiming to identify relationships between the studied variables. As differences 

between layers were not significant only SF were used in the PCA. Concentrations 

obtained from chemical analysis of the 9 elements were log transformed, as not all 

elements showed a normal distribution, and therefore the initial matrix was constituted by 

26 individuals and 9 variables. In this way, the eigenvalues, extracted by PCA for log data, 

are presented in Figure 6.5. From the factorial axes obtained only the first 2 were

considered because they explain by themselves 77% of total variance and they have 

eigenvalues higher than unit. Table 6.5 shows the factor loadings (with the ones higher 

than 0.5 marked in bold) and percentage of explained variance of the factors considered. 

Projections of the variables in the first factorial plan, defined by axis 1 and 2, are shown in

 By observing Table 6.5 and Figure 6.6, where the projection of the first plan is 

represented, it’s possible to conclude that the first factor (with an explained variance of 

63.24%) has high loadings from all the variables by the following order: Fe, Cu, Cr, Zn, 

Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd and Hg. Hg is also explained by axis 2, being even more important. In 

Figure 6.6 it’s possible to observe the association between the variables Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, 

Mn and Fe. These are typical lithogenic elements (except Cu), probably associated to the 

local geology, therefore the natural sources are likely to be explained by the first factor.  

 

 
Figure 6.6 - Projection of the variables on the first factorial plan. 

 

The second factor is responsible for 13.7% of the explained variance. It is loaded by 

Hg, but Zn and Pb appear to be associated with this element. Moreover Hg only showed 

significant correlations (Pearson correlation, p&lt;0.05) with these two elements, meaning 

that the origin could be the same. It can be also observed the high correlation between 

Zn-Pb. In addition the association between Zn, Pb, Hg in this area as been reported in 

previous studies (Barradas, 1992; Batista et al., 2002). Therefore, the second factor 

represents anthropogenic component in soil, as it is loaded by a typical anthropogenic 

element of Estarreja area. 

Spatial distribution of factor-scores for the first and second factors is given in Figure 6.7 

and Figure 6.8, indicating the relative strength of both factors in each sample. The

negative anomalies on the first factor score map indicate the high contribution of factor 1, 

and the positive anomalies on the second map indicate the contribution of factor 2 

(anthropogenic sources).

Cr, Zn, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg). 

 

Although factor 1 seems to represent the local geology, factor scores do not show a 

homogeneous distribution over the study area as it was expected. It can be observed in 

Figure 6.7 two areas where negative anomalies are more evident: one near the chemical 

complex and other in the south of the study area, near the town centre. The main reason 

may be that this factor is loaded by elements such as Cu, Zn, Hg and Pb that are typical 

anthropogenic. On the other hand, factor 2, that conceptually condenses the information

of the Hg as tracer of anthropic pollution, shows strong positive anomalies in the area 

under the influence of the chemical complex (Figure 6.8). The predominance of northwest 

winds can result in a dispersion of atmospheric emissions from the complex to the south 

or southwest of the source. However a very strong anomaly was found in sample 25.AG 

that is located near the “Esteiro de Estarreja”, which received contaminated effluents 

during decades. Moreover, Pereira et al. (1998) reported values from 49 to 340 mg/kg of 

Hg in surface sediments of the Esteiro, being the highest levels found nearby the effluent 

discharge point.

Figure 6.9, showing the projection of the cases on the first factor-plane, help on the 

visualization of factors contribution on samples distribution. Moreover it’s possible to 

distinguish a group of 3 samples (15.AG, 24.AG and 25.AG) which are related to the 

association formed by Hg, Pb and Zn. Although sample 25.AG shows the highest Hg 

concentration, it does not have the highest positive anomaly when projecting the second 

factor score (Figure 6.8) due to high concentration of other metals, especially Pb and Zn. 

It is also possible to observe in Figure 6.9 the samples with higher (14. PO) and lower 

(11.RD) contents of most metals.

6.3.3 General soil parameters affecting PTM distribution 
Some general parameters (OM, pH, TN, C/N, silt, clay and sand) determined in the 

previous chapter were included in the PCA analysis to identify their influence on 

potentially toxic metals (PTM) distribution. The 16 eigenvalues obtained, after log 

transformation, are shown in Figure 6.10. The first four axis shown in Table 6.6 have 

eigenvalues higher than unit, being the values in bold the factor loadings higher than 0.5, 

and they explain by themselves 80% of the total variance. Projections of the variables in 

the factorial plans are shown in Figure 6.11, Figure 6.12 and Figure 6.13.

By observing Table 6.6 and Figure 6.11, were the projection of the first factorial plan is 

represented it’s possible to conclude that the first factor is loaded by the variables Fe 

followed by silt, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cu, Zn, OM, Hg and TN in opposition to sand. On other 

hand, the second factor its loaded by Cd in opposition to OM and TN. The factorial plan 

defined by the first two axes contains 60.9% of the total information of the correlation 

matrix, explaining 12 of the 14 variables.

Figure 6.12 - Projection of the variables on 
the second factorial plane. 

 

Analysing Figure 6.11 it’s possible to observe the influence of texture and OM in the 

distribution of PTM, being evident two groups of elements which are suspected to have 

different sources. The first one is formed by Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb, being the first four 

associated with natural geology. The second group is formed by Cd, Hg, Zn and Cu which 

are elements likely to be affected by anthropogenic sources. Moreover, Zn, Cd and Hg do 

not show a positive correlation with OM. In addition, Cd and Hg, are not correlated with 

fine fraction. This behaviour may reflect the anthropogenic source of these elements as it 

is known that this factors control metal concentrations in soils (McMartin et al., 2002).  

The third factor is loaded by the C/N ratio in opposition to Hg. The second factorial plan 

(Figure 6.12) contains 58.8% of the information of the correlation matrix and it explains 12 

of the 14 variables. In Figure 6.12 it’s possible to identify the association between Hg, TN 
and clay (clay has only a factor loading of 0.46) and the influence of the C/N ratio on 

distribution of Hg concentrations.  

 
 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 
 

Page 100 

The fourth factor is loaded by the pHCa and the third factorial plan contains 56.8% of 

the information. The pH is not having any important role in the PTM distribution as it was 

expected, however, from Figure 6.13 an association between OM, Zn, Pb, Hg and TN can 

be identified, separated from other group (Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cu and silt) by the fourth factor. 

Even that it’s not evident, this behaviour can be an indication of parameters that can be 

affected by pH.

Figure 6.13 - Projection of the variables on third factorial plane. 

 

Figure 6.14 gives the distribution of factor-scores for the first factor, where the negative 

anomalies are samples in which silt, OM and PTM are having a significant influence, 

whereas positive anomalies represents samples where sand is a more important factor. 

This distribution is very similar to the one showed in Figure 6.7 (distribution of factor 

scores for the first factor, when applying the PCAs to PTM levels). Therefore, it’s possible 

to conclude that the distribution of PTM is influenced by samples characteristics such as 

OM and texture  

Figure 6.15 gives the distribution of factor-scores for the second factor. The negative 

anomalies on the second factor score map (Figure 6.15) indicate the Cd affected samples 

are distributed all over the studied area. Positive anomalies are samples were OM and TN 

have an important contribution.  

The group formed by samples 2.OG, 3. OG/RD, 4.RD, 6.RD and 13.PO in the scatter 

plot of the cases on the first factorial plan (Figure 6.17) doesn’t seem to be affected by Cd, 

being more important the influence of general parameters and other PTM. It should be 

noted the opposite contribution of factor 1 on samples 14.PO and 11.RD, which have 

different texture characteristics (being the first one a silt loam soil and the second one a

The positive anomalies on factor 3 (Figure 6.16), can be identified as Hg affected 

samples with low C/N ratio. Negative anomalies are samples were C/N ratio is having a 

high contribution. The second factorial plan (Figure 6.18) shows the distribution of 

samples likely to be affected by the C/N ratio and the Hg concentration. It should be noted 

the position of samples 23, 24, 25 and 26, all agricultural sites with low C/N ratio.

were found to be the samples with higher (14. PO) and lower (11.RD) contents of most 

metals, except for Cd.

Figure 6.19 shows the scatter plot of cases for the third factorial plan, being the pH the 

only variable explained by the fourth factor. It’s possible to observe which are the samples 

with lowest pH and high content on PTM and OM, and therefore identify samples that can 

represent an environmental menace. 

The main conclusion from this PCA is the influence of “natural” features on the 

potentially toxic metal concentrations and their distribution. Parameters likely to affect 

PTM distribution are mainly OM, texture and pH.

6.3.4 The land use influence and spatial distribution 
Median PTM values for each land use are shown in Table 6.7. When performing the 

Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks test to each metal, in order to find 

statistical differences from land uses, any difference could be proved. Despite this, Cu 

values were found to be higher in the RD samples, with a median value of 39 mg/kg. 

These samples are under the influence of a very busy road that crosses Estarreja, which 

during decades had high traffic intensity. The median value for AG is 23.6 mg/kg and for 
PA/OG is 45.0 mg/kg, however, excluding sample 14 this value falls to 19.8 mg/kg. Pb 

also showed differences between median values for RD (38.6 mg/kg), AG (34.2 mg/kg) 

and OG/PA (29.8 mg/kg). Cr also showed a high difference between median

concentrations in RD (22.6 mg/kg) and AG (8.6 mg/kg). This tendency, higher PTM 

concentrations in roadsides, is in accordance with other studies in urban soils (Paterson et 

al., 1996), however the agricultural sites in Estarreja shows very high medians of PTM 

concentrations and the main reason should be that in this study agricultural sites are very 

close or inside the urban area and under influence of industry. On the other hand Zn has a 

higher median in AG (68.9 mg/kg) followed by RD (53.7 mg/kg). The same was observed 

for Hg, due to the hotspots found that are agricultural sites and therefore the median 

concentration for this land use is slightly higher than for the other land uses.

Cd showed a similar distribution over the study area, with the highest concentration 

found in a roadside, near the chemical complex (Figure 6.20). Moreover the highest 

concentrations can be observed in samples near the main road and in samples 25.AG 

and 14.PO, known to be severely contaminated.  

The highest concentrations of Zn were found in samples 15.AG and 10.RD, both very 

close to the chemical complex (Figure 6.21). In addition both samples showed an 

enrichment factor of SF in relation to SB layer higher than 1.5, indicating an atmospheric 

deposition of Zn. Also sample 14.PO, has high concentration of this metal, as well as 

sample 25.AG, the one near the Esteiro of Estarreja. In fact, sample 14.PO shows the 

highest levels for all metals, except Hg, being the main source of pollution the river Antuã 

that often inundate this park. Antuã river is severely contaminated, mainly with Cu, Cr, Ni 

and Zn from industry situated upstream, being the discharges mainly from 

metalomechanics, untreated domestic sewage and textiles (Moreno, 2000).

The highest concentrations of Hg were found in samples near the chemical complex 

(sample 15.AG) or near the “Esteiro the Estarreja” (sample 25.AG), a channel from the 

Ria de Aveiro lagoon where highly contaminated effluents from a chlor-alkali plant have 

been discharged from 1950’s until 1994 (Figure 6.22). Also sample 24.AG showed a high 

concentration of Hg, being this site near a discharge point from the chemical complex 

during many years (Vala de S. Filipe). The source of Hg in sites 24.AG and 25.AG should 

be different from the samples 10.RD and 15.AG, located near the complex which showed 

an enrichment of the SF layer, indicating the atmospheric deposition of Hg (Figure 6.3).  

 

 
Figure 6.22– Spatial distribution of Hg in surface layer of Estarreja soils.

Page 108 

Cu and Pb seem to be more affected by diffuse pollution as a result of atmospheric 

deposition (Figure 6.23 and Figure 6.24 ). However, the Antuã river can also be 

considered a source of these metals (sample 14.PO). In the case of Pb, other point 

sources can also be addressed, being them the Esteiro of Estarreja (sample 25.AG) and a 

gas station near samples 1.RD and 4.RD. The spatial variability of these elements can be 

a result of different efficiency of soils samples to trap these pollutants due to their distinct 

characteristics (mainly texture).

Figure 6.24 - Spatial distribution of Pb in surface layer of Estarreja urban soils. 

 

Concluding, three sources of pollution to the urban soils of Estarreja can be defined: 

the Antuã river, emission of the chemical complex and the Esteiro of Estarreja. In the first 

case the discharges without any treatment is still an undergoing problem, and in the 

former one it is a result of decades of discharges. However natural features of soils have 

influence on PTM distribution, being difficult to assess the influence of industrial, urban or 

rural activities. Moreover the sampling area should be greater enough to notice the area 

under influence of pollution from the chemical complex.

6.4. Conclusions 
Concentrations of potentially toxic metals in Estarreja soils are not very high, especially 

when compared with other cities. Nevertheless some sites showed high concentrations of 

PTMs, being some above guidelines values.  

Hg, Zn, Cu and Pb seem to have an anthropogenic origin. Mercury is, however, the 

most evident case, especially when comparing with Aveiro and with other cities. The Hg 

contamination can be both from atmospheric deposition or contaminated channels where 

untreated effluents were released during decades. Cu and Pb showed highest median 

concentrations in roadsides showing however a uniform distribution over the study area, 

indicating diffuse pollution either due to traffic or industry. Therefore, levels of PTM in 

Estarreja soils can be assigned to the following origins: natural causes (Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn), 

industry effluents (Zn, Hg) and diffuse pollution from traffic or industry (Cu, Pb and Cd).  

Nevertheless, concentrations of PTM will be dependent of pedo-lithological conditions, 

being difficult to compare with other locals with different parent materials. The parent 

material is a very important factor that will influence not only the natural concentrations but 

also the soil properties itself. For all metals (both the ones with recognized natural origin 

and the ones with anthropogenic origin), soil characteristics that influence the efficiency to 

trap and hold metals (e.g., soil texture and specially organic matter content) seem to 

control the distribution/levels in the study area. Results seem to prove that spatial 

variability of PTM levels is a very important indicator in the definition of soil quality in 

urban environments.

7.1. Introduction 
Two classes of compounds can be used as “tracers” of several activities: polycyclic 

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyl’s (PCBs). Anthropogenic 

activities such as traffic, industry, domestic heating and agriculture can be major sources 

of these compounds. PAHs are by-products resulting from the incomplete combustion or 

pyrolysis of organic material such as coal, gas and oil, residential heating, traffic 

emissions, waste discharge and internal combustion engines (Wagrowski &amp;amp; Hites, 1997; 

IPCS, 1998; Mielke et al., 2001; Rost et al., 2002). Therefore, they are ubiquitous in urban 

environments and considered good markers of urban activities (Wong et al., 2004). PCBs 

are normally associated with industry, particularly electrical industry.  

PAHs are a large group of semivolatile, chemically stable and hydrophobic organic 

compounds, which have two or more fused benzenoid rings in their structure and no 

elements other than carbon and hydrogen (IPCS, 1998; Marce &amp;amp; Borrull, 2000). PCBs are 

chlorinated hydrocarbons with a biphenyl nucleus on which one to ten of the hydrogens 

have been replaced by chlorine. They were commercially produced as complex mixtures 

for a variety of uses, especially for electrical industry but also used in hydraulic fluids, as 

plasticizers in sealants, resins, waxes and paints as well as flame retardants in lubricating 

oils. The chemical properties that made them so useful for industry were low vapour 

pressures, low water solubilities, low reactivity, low degradability and high dielectric 

constants (Edgar et al., 1999). Unfortunately, these properties are also responsible for the 

PCB environmental contamination problem.  

Organic pollutants can be highly persistent in the environment, easily adsorbed to 

surfaces and accumulative through the food chain. Since some of them are known or 

suspected of carcinogenic and/or mutagenic activity, the fate of these compounds in the 

soil environment is critical to assess their potential hazard risk (Folch et al., 1996; 

Machala et al., 2001). Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are transported in the 

atmosphere over short and long distances in both gaseous and particulate forms and they 

tend to accumulate in soils where, due to their hydrophobicity, are likely to be retained for 

many years (Motelay-Massei et al., 2004; Erickson, 1997). Dry and wet atmospheric 

deposition is the main input of semi-volatile organic compounds to soil. Consequently, 

soils constitute, even in the urban context, the main environmental compartment for 

accumulation of organic contaminants as they are particle reactive chemicals and highly 

lipophilic (Edgar et al., 1999; Wong et al., 2004). The contamination of the environment by 

toxic organic compounds can cause chronic disruption of the biological processes within 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS

soil, particularly the ones related with soil organic matter dynamics which are key parts of 

the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Organic contaminants are known to be strongly retained 

in the organic phase of a soil and although they are subject to biodegradation and 

photodegradation, it is known that uptake of organics into soil organic matter can be 

virtually irreversible (Yang et al., 2001). Moreover, kinetics depends on soil type, with 

slower rates observed for high-organic matter soil horizons (Girvin et al., 1993), being the 

distribution constants for organic contaminants in soil proportional to the soil organic 

carbon content (Paya-Perez et al., 1991).  

For all these reasons, the analysis of persistent organic pollutants has increasingly 

importance in environmental assessments. Therefore, testing and validating methods for 

assessing the presence and the quantification of organic pollutants in soils is a useful and 

important tool for urban planning.  
 

7.2. Methodology for determination of PAHs and PCBs  
7.2.1 Extraction and cleanup 
The extraction procedure was adapted from the US EPA method 3500B (USEPA, 1996b) 

using a Soxhlet apparatus. Ten grams of soil (&amp;lt;2mm fraction) were weighed and placed 

inside a pre-washed glass wool thimble in the extraction chamber and cleaned glass wool 

was used to avoid loss of soil to the extract. Samples were extracted for 8 hours using a 

high grade hexane/acetone mixture (2:1). The extracts were concentrated to a known 

volume using a rotative evaporator at 30ºC and preserved in hexane:acetone (2:1) at 4ºC 

in dark glass vials with Teflon seals and parafilm to avoid evaporation. Extracts were 

submitted to a neutral alumina clean-up and solvent changed to isooctane for PCBs and 

to dichloromethane for PAHs analysis. The dry weight was calculated and the analysed 
mass adjusted to each soil sample. Determinations were performed in the surface layer 

samples. 
 

7.2.2 GC/MS analytical apparatus 
This study was focused in the analysis of 19 PCBs (congeners 1, 5, 18, 31, 44, 52, 66, 87, 

101, 110, 138, 141, 151, 153, 170, 180, 183, 187, 206) and 16 PAHs based on the US 

EPA list and using a modified 8270 Method for determination. The 16 PAHs determined 

were: Acenaphthene (ACE), Acenaphthylene (ACY), Anthracene (ANT), 

Benz(a)anthracene (BAA), Benzo(b)fluoranthene (BBF), Benzo(k)fluoranthene (BKF), 

Benzo(ghi)perylene (BGHI), Benzo(a)pyrene (BAP), Chrysene (CRY),

Dibenzo(ah)anthracene (DBAH), Fluoranthene (FLA), Fluorene (FLU), Indeno(1,2,3-

cd)pyrene (IND), Naphthalene (NP), Phenanthrene (PHE), Pyrene (PYR). 

Extracts were analysed using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection 

(GC/MS-QP5050A, Shimadzu Corporation), using helium as carrier gas and a DB-5 fused 

silica capillary column. The detection was achieved with a mass selective detector using 

electron ionization (EI) in the ion monitoring acquisition mode (SIM). The injection volume 

was 1 µl and in splitless injection mode using a liner with fused silica wool to promote 

complete vaporisation and also trap non-volatile residues. Column temperature for PCBs 

was programmed as follows: 40 ºC for 2 minutes, increased at a rate of 10 ºC /min until 

290ºC and kept for 8 minutes. The column flow was 0.7 ml/min. The injector temperature 

was 280ºC and the interface temperature was 300 ºC. For the analysis of the 16 PAHs 

injector temperature was 290ºC and the interface temperature was 300 ºC. The column 

temperature was programmed as follows: 35 ºC for 2 minutes, increased at a rate of 10 ºC 

/min until 220ºC followed by 6ºC /min until 260ºC and finally at 3ºC /min until 300ºC and 

kept for 6 minutes. 
 

7.2.3 Quality control and quality assurance procedures 
For quality control assessment two sub-samples of each soil sample were extracted in 

duplicate. Replicate analysis of the soil samples gave an error&amp;lt;±10%. Analysis of method 

blanks every tenth sample was performed to detect possible interferences from the 

reagents, glassware and other processing hardware.  

 Internal standard (ISTD) was used to check the consistency of the analytical step e.g. 

injection volume, instrument sensitivity and retention times. The first two are adjusted by 

calibration using the ratio of peak area compared with that for the internal standard. As 

retention time marker, ISTD, is used to identify and quantify the relative retention times 

(RRT) of unknown peaks. Relative retention time of the sample component is with 0.06 

RRT units of that of the standard component. For PCBs determination the ISTD used was 

PCB congener 209 and for PAHs determination a deuterated PAHs mixture. ISTD was 

added to each sample prior to GC-MS analysis. 

 Concentration of each compound was determined by using an internal standard 

multipoint calibration curve using five concentration levels (from 5 to 60 µg/l for PCBs and 

from 25 to 500 µg/l for PAHs). The composite stock solutions were obtained by diluting 

commercial prepared stock standards (purchased from Supelco) in isooctane (for PCBs) 

or in dichloromethane (for PAHs) and standards were then prepared in the same solvents.

In order to evaluate the linearity of the calibration the relative standard deviation was 

calculated based on the response factor (RF). The relative standard deviation of the 

response factors (RSD), for each analyte in the calibration curve, was always bellowi 

20%. The limit of detection (LOD) (in pg/µl) for each analyte was estimated from the 

calibration curve as the concentration giving a blank signal, plus three standard deviations 

of the blank (Table 7.1 and Table 7.2).

Acquisition was performed using one quantification ion and two confirmation ions. Ions 

monitored were selected following the criteria of highest relative abundance, characteristic 

fragment ions and no interferences with the nearby peaks. PAHs and PCBs in real 

samples were identified when the chromatographic peaks coincide at same retention time 

with the standard, if quantification and confirmation ions are identified (Table 7.1 and 

Table 7.2) and the ratio between the ions were the same in both sample and calibration 

mix (tolerance of 15%).

Recoveries were checked by analysing five replicates of the LGC 6113 certified 

contaminated site soil (LGC®, UK) for PCBs (Table 7.3), two replicates of the LGC 6140 

certified contaminated site soil (LGC®, UK) and three replicates of the CRM124 -100 

(RTC, USA) for PAHs (Table 7.4). The RSD was bellow 10% for each analyte. Recoveries 

ranged from 69 to 108 % for PCBs and from 26 to 105 % for PAHs. The low recoveries 

observed for some PAHs may be due to the fact of the reference material be quite old, 

especially the LGC 6140, and therefore the most volatile compounds were lost as in

previous works recoveries between 80-110 % were achieved. Moreover, as extracts are 

dried to solvent exchange, some volatile compounds may also be lost during this step. All 

results were included and any correction for recovery was made.

7.3. Results and discussion 
Annex V shows individual results of PCB congener and PAHs concentration, in Estarreja 

samples and the Normality test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), performed with SPSS® 11.0. 

As not all parameters follow a normal distribution, non-parametric statistics was used. 

Principal Component Analysis (using STATISTICA® 6.0 software) was used to identify 

relationships between variables, after log transformation of the original data. Finally, the 

influence of the land use was studied by using the Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of 

Variance on Ranks test. 

 
7.3.1 PCBs distribution in Estarreja urban area 
Table 7.5 shows the results of the sum of the 19 PCB congeners analysed. The median 

content of total PCBs in Estarreja urban soils was 8.8 µg/kg with a range between 2.3 and 

55.2 µg/kg. Besides sample 18.AG, that has a very high content in total PCBs, the highest 

values were found in samples 3.OG/RD, 14.PO, 15.AG, 16.OG, 20.AG and 25.AG. The 

spatial distribution of PCB concentrations (Figure 7.1) seems homogeneous over the 

sampling area, indicating diffuse pollution from atmospheric deposition, however it should 

be noted that some of the samples with higher concentrations are in agreement with 

metal’s concentrations.

 These values were found to be low, for an urban area, when compared with previous 

studies. For example, Lead et al. (1997) reported concentrations of 20 to 30 µg/kg in 

different long term agricultural soils, 17.5 µg/kg in south Norway and 9.5 µg/kg in north 

Norway. It has been reported in rural and urban areas of some countries the following 

values (ISS, 2003; Covacia et al., 2001): in Belgium from 3.8 to 39.3 µg/kg (mean value of 

14.5); in Italia from 3.8-91.0 µg/kg (mean value of 11); in Greece a mean value of 3.5 

µg/kg; and in Romania values from 1.0 to 134 µg/kg (mean value of 35.0). In Seine River 

Basin the sum of 7 PCBs was found to be from 0.09 µg/kg (town centre, 12,175 

inhabitants) to 159 µg/kg (town centre, 8,000 inhabitants, northeast of an industrial area), 

both in public gardens (Montelay-Massei et al., 2004). However Estarreja results are 

above the mean value of 4 µg/kg (sum of 30 PCBs) in UK soils reported by Lead et al. 

(1997).

 Although the magnitude of values observed in many studies, the Italian legislation has 

a limit value of PCBs in soils from residential areas/public land of 1 µg kg-1 (sum of total 

PCBs) what seems to be very low. In the Dutch guidelines it is established that the 

optimum value, given as the sum of 7 PCBs (18, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) from the 

European Standard, is 20 µg/kg. In this case, as only six of those seven PCBs were 

studied, it was considered the sum of these 6 PCBs (18, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180) and 

only sample 18 was above this value. Sample 18 is an agricultural soil near the town 

centre, and there is no apparent reason for this high concentration observed.  

 No statistical differences between land uses could be observed, however the highest 

median concentration was found in agricultural sites (10.7 µg/kg) and the lowest one in 

roadsides (5.4 µg/kg). 
 

7.3.1.1 PCB congener pattern in soil 
The PCB profiles can give some indications about the origin and the fate of these 

contaminants. Therefore, the median percentages of the individual congeners of 

?19PCBs were calculated (Table 7.6). In general, lower-chlorinated (&lt;3Cl) PCBs are in 

less percentage than the higher–chlorinated (&gt;4Cl) ones. The profile of Estarreja is 

dominated by hexa-chlorinated congeners (PCBs 138, 141, 151, 153) consistent with 

results in the literature for remote sites (Lead et al., 1997; Weiss et al., 2000).  

In spite of the results obtained, the industrial sites are usually characterized by 

homogeneous proportions (as many light compounds as heavy ones) with slightly higher 

proportions of the higher molecular weight PCBs, indicating that the PCBs signature is 

preserved over short transport distance. The principal elimination pathway of PCBs from 

soil is volatilisation (Montelay-Massei et al., 2004), with the air-soil system approaching a 

thermodynamic equilibrium, being this process that affects mainly the lightest congeners. 

Wilcke et al. (1999) has concluded that, lower chlorinated PCBs become more dominant 

the more distant from the sources, because of their volatility. Other studies (Wilcke et al., 

1999; Weiss et al., 2000) show that lower chlorinated PCBs are mainly dominant in the 

rural soils or remote sites. PCBs with 5 or more chlorines are quite resistant to 

biodegradation, but photolysis may result in some breakdown of highly-chlorinated PCBs.  

There is a range of possible explanations for this PCB profiles (Wilcke et al., 1999) 

being in this case the most probable the age of the contamination (which determines the 

time available for volatilisation) and sample treatment (as drying extracts may lead to PCB 

losses, particularly of the more volatile lower chlorinated congeners).

PCA was performed to investigate the spatial differences and similarities of congener 

patterns in soil samples from different sampling sites. Concentrations obtained from 

chemical analysis for the 19 compounds were log transformed and therefore the initial 

matrix was constituted by 26 individuals and 19 variables. In this way, the 19 eigenvalues 

extracted by PCA for log data are presented in Figure 7.2. Table 7.7 shows the factor 

loadings (with the ones higher than 0.5 marked in bold), eigenvalues and percent of 

variance for the first four factors with eigenvalues higher than unit, which explain by 

themselves 74% of total variance. Projections of the variables in the first factorial plan, 

defined by axis 1 and 2, are shown in Figure 7.3. Projection of the cases on the first 
factorial plan is shown in Figure 7.5. 

By observing Table 7.7 and Figure 7.3, where the projection of the first factorial plan is 

represented, it’s possible to conclude that the first factor its loaded by the PCB congeners 

138, 153, 110, 151,180, 170, 141, 87, 101, 44, 206, 52, 18, 187. On other hand, the 

second factor its loaded by the PCB congeners 31, 5, 52 in opposition to 183. The third 

factor is loaded by the PCB congener 187 and the fourth factor by PCB congeners 1 and 

141. These last two factors are not represented as their contribution is not very significant.

The factorial plan defined by the first two axes contains 60% of the total information of 

the correlation matrix, explaining 17 of the 19 variables (Figure 7.3). By observing the 

projection of variables on the first factor plan it’s possible to distinguish two groups 

characterized by the number of chlorines in the structure. Therefore one group is 

constituted by the light PCBs (1, 5, 18, 31, 44, 52 and 66) and the other by the penta-CB 

to the octa-CB.

Light PCBs 

Figure 7.3 - Projection of the variables on the first factorial plane. 
 

Distribution of factor-scores for the first factor (explained variance of 46%) is given in 

Figure 7.4, indicating the relative strength of this factor in each sample. Conceptually, 

factor 1 condenses the information of PCBs (mainly the penta-CB to the octa-CB) as 

tracers of long-term pollution. 

When looking to the projection of cases on the first factorial plan (Figure 7.5) the main 

conclusion is that a distinction can be made within samples with higher content of more 

chlorinated PCBs. Samples 3.OG/RD, 4.RD and 24.AG are strongly affected by these 

PCBs but especially by PCB 183. This can be an indication of long term pollution. Sample 

18.AG is the most contaminated one and is affected by the penta-CB to the octa-CB 

PCBs, with lower influence of the lighter PCBs. In fact this sample can be influencing the 

results as it is an outlier in what concerns PCBs concentrations. Samples 14.PO, 15.AG, 

16.OG, 20.AG and 25.AG have a more homogeneous distribution of congeners probably

reflecting a more recent contamination. Moreover, some of these samples are located 

close to the chemical complex, which is the suspected source of these pollutants as they 

are byproducts of the PVC and polymers production. However further investigation is 

needed in order to address whether the chemical complex is a source or not of PCBs into 

Estarreja soils. On the other hand samples, 12.OG/RD, 19.AG, 7.OG/RD and 8.OG/RD 

have a strong contribution of lighter chlorinated PCBs. Sample 19.AG is outside the urban 

area but the other are located near the city centre.

7.3.2 PAHs distribution in Estarreja urban area 
Table 7.8 shows the sum of the 16 PAHs for each sample and in Figure 7.6 it is shown the 

spatial distribution of results. The sum of PAHs ranged from 26.7 to 2016 µg/kg with a 

median value of 97.5 µg/kg. The samples containing higher concentration of PAHs are 

samples 19.AG and 20.AG located outside the town, however samples 3.OG/RD and 

4.RD also have high concentrations and they are located inside the town centre.

Figure 7.6 - Spatial distribution of SumPAHs in surface layer of Estarreja urban soils. 

 

The concentration of PAHs in Estarreja soils is comparable with soils of other 

European cities (Trapido, 1999; Maliszewska-Kordybach, 1996; Motelay-Massei et al., 

2004). In Parnu (51 800 inhab., Estonia) PYR and FLU are the most abundant in both 

urban and suburban surface soils, where PAHs concentrations ranged from 49 to 2540 

µg/kg (Maliszewska-Kordybach, 1996) and in Rouen (579 000 inhab., France) 
concentrations ranged from 5-292 µg/kg (Motelay-Massei et al., 2004). Typical 

background concentrations of PAHs in European remote or agricultural sites have been 

estimated to be approximately 100 µg/kg (Trapido, 1999). Aamot et al. (1996) found 

concentrations in Norwegian surface forest soils ranging from 13 to 169 µg/kg and 

concentrations in agricultural soils in Poland showed average values of 264 µg/kg

(Maliszewska-Kordybach, 1996). The accumulation of PAHs in urban soils over many 

years could explain concentrations measured in the larger and older European cities 

where domestic heating and automobile traffic are the important potential sources of 

PAHs while in Estarreja the predominant potential source of these compounds should be 

industry due to its fairly short history and a low population.  

According to Maliszewska-Kordybach (1996) PAH classification for agricultural soils, 

21 samples from Estarreja can be considered as non-contaminated, since ?PAHs were 

below 200 (µg/kg soil). On the other hand samples 19.AG and 20.AG can be considered 

heavily contaminated since they showed a ?PAHs above 1000 (µg/kg soil). Samples 

3.RD, 4.RD and 17.AG are considered weakly contaminated (?PAHs between 200 and 

600 µg/kg). Although this classification was established for agricultural soils implying a 

more sensitive use of soil it has been used previously to classify soil samples taken from 

industrial and urban locations based on SumPAHs (Motelay-Massei et al., 2004).  

 No statistical differences between land uses could be observed, however the highest 

median concentration was found in agricultural sites (111 µg/kg with a important 

contribution of the high levels of samples 19 and 20) and the lowest one in roadsides (57 
µg/kg). 

 

7.3.2.1 PAH pattern in soil 
Usually the highest molecular weight PAHs are predominant in soils since the lighter ones 

are more easily biodegraded and volatilised (Wilcke et al., 1996; Blanchard et al., 2004). 
Because of that and also due to analytical problems, NP is below the detection limit in 

many samples. This compound is commonly associated with natural and not so much with 

anthropogenic processes (IPCS, 1998). The relative abundance of individual PAH in 

Estarreja soils is shown in Table 7.9, being the most abundant FLA and PYR followed by 
BBF and CRY. These PAHs are the ones usually associated with the combustion of fossil 

fuel and other burnable materials (IPCS, 1998) and this composition is typical for topsoil of 

European industrialized countries (Krauss &amp;amp; Wilcke, 2003). 

 PAHs originating from pyrolytic processes such as fuel combustion in automobiles are 

characterized by low PHE/ANT ratios (&lt;10). On the other hand, petrogenic PAHs, formed 

by the slow maturation of organic matter, typically show higher PHE/ANT ratios (&gt;10). 

Similarly, a ratio of 1 for FLA/PYR can also be indicative of pyrolytic origin of the PAHs 

(Wang et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2005). 



 

 

   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS 

 

 Page 129 
 

 In Estarreja the median ratio for PHE/ANT was 3.17 (ranging between 1.18 to12.3) and 

1.16 for the ratio FLA/PYR (ranging between 0.88 to 1.53), both indicative of predominant 

pyrolytic origin of PAH such as motor vehicle exhaust. 

 When considering the sum of the 6 carcinogenic PAHs (BAA, BBF, BKF, BAP, DBAH 

and IND) according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC - [w16]), it 

was observed that they represent 38% of total concentration for Estarreja samples. 

Therefore the contamination of PAHs in Estarreja represents a health hazard.

PCA was performed to investigate the spatial differences and similarities of PAHs 

patterns in soil samples from different sampling sites. Concentrations obtained from 

chemical analysis for the 16 compounds were log transformed and therefore the 16 

eigenvalues extracted by PCA for log data are presented in Figure 7.7. Table 7.10 shows 

the factor loadings (with the ones higher than 0.5 marked in bold), eigenvalues and 

percent of variance for the first two factors with eigenvalues higher than unit which explain 

by themselves 85.5% of total variance. Projection of the variables in the first factorial plan 

is shown in Figure 7.8 and projection of the cases on the first factorial plan is shown in 
Figure 7.9. 

The first factor is loaded by the all PAHs except NP and ACE, being the last explained 

by the second axes. By observing the projection of variables on the first factor plan it’s 

possible to distinguish the association between the mid to high molecular weight PAHs. 

Another group can be defined as the low molecular weight PAHs (ACE, FLU, ANT and 

PHE). ACY and NP are the more volatile compounds, that had very low recoveries.

Factor 1 (with an explained variance of 77.9%) condenses the information of the mid to 

high molecular PAHs as tracer of anthropogenic pollution (Table 7.10). Distribution of 

factor-scores for the first factor is given in Figure 7.10, indicating the relative strength of 

this factor in each sample. Figure 7.10 together with Figure 7.9 shows the samples likely 

to be affected by the presence of high molecular weight PAHs, being mainly agricultural 

samples (17, 19 and 20) located outside the urban area but close to each other. Figure 

7.9 also shows the samples affected by lighter PAHs which are sample 3.OG/RD and 

4.RD, located inside the urban area and close to the main road.

7.3.3 Soil parameters affecting PAHs and PCBs distribution 
In order to asses the influence of other soil parameters such as OM, C/N, texture, pH and 

PTM, principal component analysis was performed. The initial matrix, obtained after log 

transformation of data, was constituted by 26 individuals and 13 variables and the 

eigenvalues extracted by PCA are presented in Figure 7.11. Table 7.11 shows the factor 

loadings (with the ones higher than 0.5 marked in bold), eigenvalues and percent of 

variance for the first four factors with eigenvalues higher than unit which explain by 

themselves 57.5% of total variance. 

Factor 1 is loaded by Pb, silt, Fe, Cu, Zn, OM and Hg in opposition to sand. The 

second factor is loaded by the SumPCBs and again by Hg in opposition to C/N. The third 

factor is loaded by the PCBs and PAHs in opposition to Cd and the fourth factor by pH. 

The third factorial plan is not represented as its contribution is not significant for the 

organic contaminants distribution.

The factorial plan defined by the first two axes contains 57.5% of the total information 

of the correlation matrix, explaining 10 of the 13 variables (Figure 7.12). It’s evident from 

Figure 7.12, the projection of variables on the first factorial plan, the presence of two 
groups separated by factor 2. The first one is formed by OM, silt and Fe and other by the 

PTMs together with sumPCBs. Therefore it’s possible to conclude that second factor is 

more likely to be related with anthropogenic pollution, as Hg and Sum of PCBs are typical 

anthropogenic pollutants. Moreover from the previous chapter it is known that Hg, Zn and 

Pb are metals having influence in their distribution on Estarreja soils.  

Although factor 1 is statistically dominant (with an explained variance of 44.5%), the 

factor 2 that explains only 12.4% but condenses the information of SumPCBs and Hg as 

tracer of pollution. Therefore the distribution of factor-scores for the second factor is 

shown (Figure 7.13), indicating the relative strength of this factor in each sample. 

Negative anomalies represents sites were SumPCBs and Hg are having more influence, 

and positive anomalies samples the ratio C/N is having more importance. From this plot 

it’s possible to observe that contamination due to Hg and sumPCBs is more or less 

spread over the studied area. In Figure 7.14 it is possible to identify two groups of 

samples which are having different contribution of both factors, being one constituted by 

samples near the chemical complex (factor 2) and other by samples from the town centre 

(factor 1).

The second factorial plan contains 54.1% of the total information of the correlation 

matrix, explaining 11 of the 13 variables (Figure 7.15). From this plan it’s possible to 

observe the association between SumPCBs and PAHs in opposition to Cd. In what 

concerns factor 1, two groups can be distinguished separated by factor 2. 

 The third factor is responsible for 12% of explained variance however condenses the 

information of SumPCBs and SumPAHs as tracer of pollution. Therefore the distribution of 

factor-scores for the third factor is shown (Figure 7.16), indicating the relative strength of 

this factor in each sample. Negative anomalies represents sites were SumPCBs and 

SumPAHs are having more influence, and positive anomalies represents samples were 

Cd is having more importance. Both anomalies showed a similar distribution over the 

study area. In Figure 7.17 the influence of both factors in each sample can be observed.

From this PCA it was possible to conclude that the source of PCBs, as it was 

suspected, is the industry, as it was associated with other pollutants with this origin. 

Neither PCBs nor PAHs showed an evident influence of OM, pH or texture in their 

distribution as it was expected. 

 

7.4. Conclusions 
The spatial distribution of PCB concentrations seems homogeneous over the sampling 

area, indicating diffuse pollution from atmospheric deposition. However it should be noted 

that the most problematic samples are in accordance with the results of PTM (except 

sample 18). The PCBs levels were found to be low for an urban area, when compared 

with previous studies, being the pattern more similar to the one found in remote areas 

what can indicate long term pollution.  

Concentration of PAHs in Estarreja soils is comparable with soils of other European 

cities. Two samples were considered heavily contaminated and other two weakly 

contaminated. Most abundant PAHs were FLA and PYR followed by BBF and CRY, being 
these PAHs usually associated with the combustion of fossil fuel and other burnable 

materials (confirmed by the signature revealed by the ratio of indicative PAHs). Samples

likely to be affected by the presence of high molecular weight PAHs, are mainly 

agricultural samples located outside the urban area but very close to each other. 

However, samples affected by lighter PAHs are located inside the urban area and close to 

the main road. Moreover, the contamination of PAHs in Estarreja represents a health 

hazard as almost 40% of the PAHs emited are considered carcinogenic. 

Although the mixed signature of all the sources isn’t clear to address with accuracy a 

source of PAHs (either industry or traffic), for PCBs it was more evident the influence of 

industry. Neither PCBs nor PAHs showed an evident influence of OM, pH or texture in 

their distribution as it was expected.

In order to conduct a survey on urban soils quality, first it is necessary to have a 

preliminary characterization of the ecosystem to better plan the sampling and to define the 

parameters to be analysed. This initial assessment includes the collection of background 

information about climate, hydrology, city history and also about the social organization, 

as socio-economic indicators are driving forces for the formation of a city as environment. 

Sampling is an essential step in urban soils quality assessment, and of complex 

planification since they are not considered as a continuous system, being repeatedly 

interrupted by roads, buildings foundations, pipes and cables. The set of indicators 

selected to assess urban soil quality will depend of the purpose of the study, city 

specifications and analytical capabilities of the laboratory. Moreover it is necessary to 

keep in mind that soil quality is a function of the intended use for the land. 
 

 Estarreja is a small city, well known for its chemical industry; activity whose importance 

has however been decreasing over the years. The area around the chemical complex and 

the lagoon (Ria de Aveiro) as been subject to several studies, but none was carried out in 

the urban area. In the last years population in the urban centre is increasing, therefore 

affecting the land consumption and anthropogenic pressures in soils, turning it important 

to have soil protection policies, especially in an area likely to be affected by industrial 

pollution. 
 

 Estarreja soils can be characterized as slightly acid, with low contents in organic matter 

and total carbon, and an organic matter enriched surface layer. The cation exchange 

capacity values are low, and the low nutrient status turn these soils very infertile. Some 

samples showed very high percentages of exchangeable Na, probably reflecting rainwater 

influence. In what regards texture, they are classified as sandy loam or loamy sand. 

Therefore, a high percentage of sand seems to be a natural feature of the studied area, 

except in the city centre, probably due to management practices of ornamental gardens. 

In spite of this, general parameters characterized were in accordance with the expected 

results due to soil type (podzols).  
 

Concentrations of potentially toxic metals in Estarreja soils are, in general, not very 

high (comparing with other cities), with some sites showing values of Cu, Zn, Cd and Hg 

above the guidelines. Some hypothesis about the sources and pathways could be 

addressed from this study: Ni, Cd, Mn, Fe and Cr probably have a geogenic origin, while 

Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Hg have anthropogenic sources. Mercury is the most evident case 



GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS

suggesting an anthropogenic origin, being this element also one of the most important 

contamination problems of the region. 
 

PCBs concentrations are low for an urban area, when compared with other urban or 

industrialized areas. The spatial distribution of PCB concentrations seems homogeneous 

over the sampling area, indicating diffuse pollution from atmospheric deposition. It should 

be noted that some of the samples with higher concentrations are in agreement with metal 

concentrations. In addition, the profile of PCBs in Estarreja is dominated by hexa-

chlorinated congeners which can be considered a tracer of long-term pollution.  
 

Concentration of PAHs in Estarreja soils is comparable with soils of other European 

cities. PAHs pattern found is usually associated with the combustion of fossil fuel and 

other burnable materials. Samples likely to be affected by the presence of high molecular 

weight PAHs are mainly agricultural samples located outside the urban area but very 

close to each other. However, samples affected by lighter PAHs are located inside the 

urban area and close to the main road. Moreover, the contamination of PAHs in Estarreja 

represents a health hazard as almost 40% of the PAH emitted are considered 

carcinogenic.  
 

 Concerning the influence of land use on the indicators of soil quality, organic matter 

content is the parameter that seems to be more affected. In addition, Cu and Pb show 

higher concentrations in roadsides, even though not statistically proved. On the other 

hand, Zn, Hg, PAHs and PCBs show higher concentrations in agricultural sites, probably 

as a result of point source contamination. Moreover the point sources of potentially toxic 

metals identified were the Antuã river, the chemical complex and the Esteiro the Estarreja.  
 

 The parent material is a very important factor that will influence not only the natural 

concentrations of potentially toxic metals but also the soil properties itself. Moreover, 

general parameters characterization is in accordance with the expected results for this soil 

type and management practices. General properties of the soils, especially organic 

matter, show an influence on potentially toxic metals distribution. However, Hg and Cd are 

outliers in behaviour probably due to deposition from anthropogenic sources. In addition, 

organic contaminants distribution is not influenced by general soil parameters. An 

exception is the effect of the C/N ratio in SumPCBs distribution, that also showed an 

influence in the case of Hg.  



 

 

   GEOCHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF URBAN SOILS

 Contributing to the control of the distribution/levels of potentially toxic metals (both 

those with recognized natural origin and the ones with anthropogenic origin), natural 

features of soils sampled (e.g., soil texture and especially organic matter content) results 

in some occurrences of low concentrations of most metals probably due to lixiviation of 

soils resulting in contaminations of the quaternary aquifer and streams. 

 This natural spatial variability of soils and the genesis of urban soils bring some 

difficulties regarding the assessment of the soils quality, being difficult to assess whereas 

contamination is due only to industry or if there is also a contribution of the urban area 

itself. In addition, the city size and the traffic density is expected to have a minor 

contribution to the pollution levels observed. Moreover all studied area seems to be 

affected by pollution. A larger set of sampling sites would allow a clear perception of the 

influence of the chemical complex: samples (with similar characteristics of texture and 

organic matter) collected at increasing distances from this source would more accurately 

highlight the importance of contamination arising from the chemical complex and the area 

of influence. A bigger set of sampling sites, with more samples of each land use type, 

would also enable to distinguish the real influence of each type of land use on soil quality. 

In the present study this influence was partially diluted by the specific characteristics of 

each sample.  
 

 In what concerns human health, the major threat is likely to be from agriculture and 

dust inhalation from the park near the river Antuã, with high levels of PTM, where children 

engage in ludic activities. Considering diet as a primary transfer pathway, it should be 

highlighted that the highest levels of persistent organic pollutants were found in agriculture 

sites, increasing the exposure risk through the ingestion of contaminated crops. This 

potential health hazard is relevant attending that it was found that in Estarreja, a 

significant fraction of PAHs are carcinogenic. Furthermore, the contamination observed in 

two agricultural sites in the east side of the study area should be further investigated in 

order to confirm the extent of the contamination and to determine its source. 
 

 Concluding, the set of indicators chosen can be used for a sustainable urban planning, 

allowing a more efficient management of resources available as well as an effective 

control of state changes occurring in the environmental quality of urban ecosystems. 

Moreover they allow to take some conclusions about the aptitude of a soil to the use, if 

soil is playing its role as a sink of contaminants and whereas it represents or not a hazard 

for human health.
