resumo 
 

 

O presente trabalho pretendeu explorar as potencialidades de 
nanocompósitos, baseados em nanoestruturas de carbono e nanopartículas 
metálicas, para a deteção de biomoléculas através da técnica de difusão de 
Raman intensificada por superfície (SERS, surface-enhanced Raman 
scattering).  
Primeiramente foram preparados nanocompositos de álcool polivinílico com 
nanopartículas de prata sintetizadas através de dois métodos, ainda sem a 
presença de nanoestruturas de carbono. Verificou-se que estas membranas 
apresentaram bons resultados na identificação de ácidos nucleicos por 
SERS.  
A síntese e caracterização do óxido de grafeno que serviu de base para a 
preparação dos nanocompósitos de prata e ouro foi objecto de estudo. A sua 
redução química com diferentes agentes redutores foi explorada, uma vez 
que o grau de redução deste nanomaterial pode ser um fator determinante 
para a aplicação pretendida (interação com biomoléculas).  
A preparação de nanocompósitos de óxido de grafeno com prata e ouro foi 
realizada com diferentes agentes redutores. A atividade de SERS destes 
novos nanocompósitos foi então explorada na presença de vários analitos, 
em diferentes condições de aquisição dos espectros de Raman, bem como 
em diferentes tipos de suporte. Verificou-se que os nanocompósitos 
preparados com prata apresentaram a particularidade de permitirem a 
intensificação dos sinais de Raman das bandas D e G do grafeno. É de 
salientar a introdução de um novo agente redutor amigo do ambiente para 
síntese de compósitos de grafeno com nanopartículas metálicas: o extrato de 
eucalipto. Outra variável introduzida foi a preparação de nanopartículas de 
ouro em forma de nanoestrelas sintetizadas com hidroxilamina na presença 
de óxido de grafeno, tendo-se obtido assim um novo nanocompósito com 
potencialidades em SERS. 
Com o objectivo de preparar suportes para SERS com uma topografia e 
porosidade adequadas à criação de locais privilegiados para a agregação de 
nanopartículas metálicas e para a penetração das moléculas do analito foram 
produzidas mantas por electrofiação. Para tal, selecionaram-se os polímeros 
álcool polivinílico e poliacrilonitrilo. Com esta técnica preparam-se igualmente 
nanocompósitos de ouro ou prata e grafeno. Estudaram-se algumas variáveis 
de síntese, tais como a introdução de nanopartículas e nanocompósitos in 
situ, (isto é, durante o processo de electrofiação), deposição posterior das 
nanopartículas e dos nanocompósitos nas fibras poliméricas (preparadas 
previamente) e funcionalização superficial das mantas com o objectivo de 
ligar os nanomateriais a posteriori. 
Por fim, foi também explorada a potencialidade em SERS de novas 
estruturas compostas por florestas de nanotubos de carbono com cobertura 
de ouro produzidas por deposição química de vapor. Verificou-se que a 
detecção de bases de ADN e o próprio ADN é possível usando estes 
materiais.

abstract 

 
The present work aimed to explore the potential of new nanocomposites based 
on carbon nanostructures and metal nanoparticles for the detection of 
biomolecules through surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).  
In a first step, polyvinyl alcohol composites were prepared incorporating silver 
nanoparticles by two different reduction procedures. At first without introduction 
of carbon nanostructures. These composites showed good results for the SERS 
identification of nucleic acids.  
Next, the synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide was studied to be 
used in the preparation of silver and gold nanocomposites. The reduction of this 
nanomaterial with different chemical agents was explored, since its reduction 
degree may be a determinant factor for the application envisaged (biomolecules 
interaction).  
The preparation of the nanocomposites with silver and gold was performed with 
different reducing agents. The SERS activity of these new nanocomposites was 
then explored in the presence of different analytes, varying the experimental 
conditions for Raman spectra acquisition. It was interesting to verify that the 
silver containing nanocomposites presented the particularity to intensify the 
graphene D and G bands. It is also important to highlight that a new eco-friendly 
reducing agent was tested for the synthesis of the graphene oxide composites, 
an Eucalyptus Globulus extract. Other variable introduced was the preparation 
of gold nanostars synthesized with hydroxylamine in the presence of graphene 
oxide, which allowed the preparation of a new nanocomposite with SERS 
potential. 
Fibrous membranes were also prepared by electrospinning with the aim to 
prepare SERS supports with adequate topography and porosity for the 
formation of nanoparticles agglomerates for the creation of the so-called hot-
spots and also to allow the penetration of the analyte molecules. The polymers 
polyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylonitrile were selected for electrospinning. Using 
this technique, electrospun mantles with silver and gold nanoparticles and 
nanocomposites were prepared. Several variables were studied, such as the 
introduction of the nano-fillers during the electrospinning process, later 
deposition of the nano-fillers on the simple electrospun polymeric fibres and 
surface functionalization of the simple polymeric membranes to link the nano-
fillers.  
At last, the potentialities of using carbon nanotubes forests, produced by 
chemical vapor deposition and coated with gold film by sputtering, as new 
SERS substrates were explored. It was found that the SERS detection of DNA 
bases and ADN itself is possible using these substrates.

In this chapter a general framework of the content of the thesis is shown, to 

provide an overview on the work developed. 

The description of the main technique used in this thesis, surface-enhanced 

Raman scattering (SERS), is done. Also, the types and evolution of SERS 

substrates are described. The carbon nanostructures are also described here, 

with special relevance to graphene and carbon nanotubes. A brief description 

is made on graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide. The 

properties of these carbon nanostructures that are relevant for the study 

developed in this thesis are also mentioned. On the other hand, the carbon 

nanostructures are explored in relation to surface-enhanced Raman scattering 

research. 

The main objectives of this thesis which, in a generic way are to develop 

substrates based on carbon nanostructures that are active in surface-enhanced 

Raman scattering, are presented in the last topic.

1.1. Introduction 

Specific detection of proteins characteristic of some diseases plays an important role 

in biochemistry and biomedical research areas. In particular, the measurement of 

cancer biomarkers is of major importance for early detection and high reliability 

prognosis of such disease. This is a great challenge for the community that is 

dedicated to this type of scientific research, with the development of the interface 

between nanoscience and medicine one of the most interesting areas of science. 

Raman spectroscopy, in particular SERS (Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering) is a 

new and very promising approach for specialized investigation due to its ability to 

identify structurally a molecule with very high sensitivity1. The enhancement of 

Raman signals has been observed up to 106 getting the particular case of single 

molecule detection. This notable enhancement provides high sensibility and offers an 

opportunity of development of ultra-sensitive analytical methods for chemical and 

biochemical detection2. SERS has been used as a selective and sensitive method in the 

detection of proteins and oligonucleotides 3.  

Due to SERS recent development, it is expected that its applications are extended to 

the analysis of cells and tissues. The first studies have already started to be done 1,4 

however, more studies are needed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of 

SERS related to other techniques, particularly fluorescence microscopy that uses 

molecular fluorophores and quantum dots. In the case of experiments in vivo with 

nanoparticles and SERS labels, the biodistribution and toxicity have been studied 5,6.  

Eighty years after the discovery of the Raman effect, conventional Raman scattering 

has already made the transition to the clinics, for example, in the area of bacteria 

identification or in surgery for online monitoring by fiber optic probes. The next years 

will show whether SERS in targeted research as a relatively new approach will 

experience a similar success story3.  

Several research groups are actively working on improved designs of SERS probes 

with high sensitivity and reproducible signals, and the number of biomedical SERS 

applications is constantly increasing3. However, a good enhancement of the Raman

signal is required for the application to be successful being the SERS substrate the 

key factor7. 

Graphene is a promising material to be used as SERS substrate. Recently, graphene 

by itself was reported as a clear inducer of the enhancement of Raman signal 

intensity in adsorbed molecules8-10.  This enhancement was attributed to charge 

transfer between graphene and the molecules of the analyte. Graphene and gold 

nanocomposites have demonstrated good results as SERS substrates11 . The 

arrangement between gold nanoparticles and graphene can attribute a unique 

mechanism of electronic transfer or energetic between both phases which allows the 

observation of SERS. Also, silver nanoparticles were used in graphene-based 

nanocomposites to enhance Raman signals12. 

Graphene is aromatic, hydrophobic and chemical inert. It is also biocompatible and 

has potential bioapplications13. Due to exceptional charge mobility and atomic 

thickness graphene was been proposed as the basis to sensitive detection and 

chemical/biological free-label14. Graphene oxide (GO) is the oxidated form of graphene 

and this derivative can interact with nanoparticles to produce structural 

nanocomposites after its reduction15. Moreover, being a two-dimensional 

nanostructure with an adjustable chemical surface,  functionalized graphene can 

produce strong interfaces with biological systems without geometric limitations13. 

Graphene has also the facility to adsorb biomolecules due to ?-? stacking between its 

hexagonal cells and the carbon rings present in the majority of nano/biomolecules16. 

Currently, graphene has been employed in several areas that go from chemical 

sensors to transistors. The majority is based on the electric properties. In the last few 

years, researchers have become increasingly interested in developing SERS 

substrates based on graphene. In this work we will show the advances in this area.

1.2. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering 

 

1.2.1. Description of SERS technique 

SERS is almost 40 years old. The first SERS spectrum was recorded in 1947 by 

Fleischman and co-workers; and in 1977 it was shown by Jeanmaire and Van Duyne 

to possess what is surely the most iconic characteristic of SERS: a Raman cross-

section per molecule some million-fold larger than for the same molecule in solution17. 

In these four decades, SERS phenomenon is not yet completely understood neither is 

predictable. The enhancement factor can be understood as a contribution of two 

mechanisms: (a) electromagnetic and (b) chemical. The electromagnetic mechanism 

occurs because the intensity of Raman scattering is directly proportional to the square 

of the induced dipole moment, µind, which, in turn, is the product of the Raman 

polarizability, ?, and the magnitude of the incident electromagnetic field, E. As a 

consequence of exciting the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a 

nanostructured or nanoparticle metal surface, the local electromagnetic field is 

enhanced compared to Raman signal 18. This mechanism is consensual in research 

community. 

In the case of chemical mechanism, several theories are proposed: (i) metal-ligand 

complex formation19, (ii) the creation of new metal to molecule or molecule to metal 

charge transfer resonances much like those that are common in transition metal 

coordination complexes20, or (iii) the transient residence of hot electrons or electron-

hole pairs out of the metal on the molecule21. The surface plasmon (SP) was described 

as a superposition of metal electron-hole pairs formed through isoenergetic transitions 

of magnitude equal to the frequency of SP. The hot electrons can transitorily reside on 

the molecule added, forming a radical anion. So, it was suggested that the molecule 

added can accelerate the dephasing of plasmon. Such processes occur without any 

doubt in adsorbed-molecule-systems but are still a great deal to chemists and 

physicists. Nevertheless, none of the models presented here have yet yielded a 

quantitative or predictive theory. So it is hard to say to what extent they contribute to 

the enhancement17.

? Page 6 

 

Some confusion in SERS remains between the concepts of ?surface-enhancement? and 

?very strong Raman cross-sections? which may be endemic to the analyte adsorbed, 

even when it is in solution. Molecules, such as Rhodamine 6G (R6G), a known SERS 

probe, may have enormous Raman cross-sections and, therefore, their SERS spectra 

are very intense. If the molecule also fluoresces, Raman spectrum may only be 

recorded when such florescence is quenched, as happens when the molecule is 

adsorbed on a metal surface, or by using ultrafast techniques, essentially recording 

the Raman spectrum before the fluorescence intensity become greater, or when the 

system is stable enough to be able to overcome the shot noise, by using techniques 

that allow register the difference of intensity and an appropriate signal acquisition 

time. For that reason, a large Raman cross-section does not mean a large SERS 

enhancement17.  

The enhancement of Raman signal comes up to 1014 times higher than in conventional 

Raman scattering 22 and can detect quantities as small as single-molecule 23-25. The 

two major advantages of using SERS are the high sensitivity and molecular 

specificity. Although SERS mechanism remains uncertain, these are the reasons why 

this technique has being improved and medical applications and the design of 

portable devices for in vitro diagnosis are increasingly coming realities 26-28.  

 

1.2.2. SERS substrates 

Since the first SERS spectrum was observed using a rough silver electrode, substrates 

have started being developed: (1) substrates without uniformity prepared by 

electrochemical oxidation – reduction cycles or by deposition in vacuum; (2) colloidal 

solutions prepared by chemical synthesis and composed by nanoparticles with a big 

size distribution; (3) nanoparticles with size and shape controlled by a chemical 

method; (4) nanostructured surfaces with size, shape and inter-particle spacing well-

structured prepared by self-assembly, mold or lithography; and (5) atom-thickness 

materials, such as graphene and graphene oxide, with or without metal nanoparticles 

intercalated. Specially, in the last two to three years, SERS substrates have been 

more structurally controlled due to nanoscience and nanotechnology improvement.    



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

? Page 7 

 

The enhancement of the spectroscopic signal obtained can be 104 – 106 for Ag, Au e 

Cu, and 10 – 104 for other transition metals, such as Fe, Co, Ni, Rh, Pd and Pt by 

using substrates prepared by electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycles. This method 

is easy to use, produces stable substrates and their contamination have less chances 

to occur29,30. Colloidal suspensions of gold and silver nanoparticles started to be more 

used as SERS substrates after shape, size and composition of the nanoparticles could 

be controlled by synthetic methods. Theoretical calculations indicate an enhancement 

of 103 – 104, in the case of Au, and 106 e 107, for Ag31. Normally, SERS signals 

obtained by colloidal suspensions are weak. In order to improve this result, depositing 

colloidal suspension of metal nanoparticles onto solid substrate is a common 

technique to prepare a nanoparticle monolayer to induce their coupling. Apart from 

being a very simple alternative it has shown very effective results. However, a 

nanoparticle monolayer may not have a uniform distribution and, therefore, SERS 

signals are not similar from equivalent substrates. Best results can be achieved by 

concentrating the colloidal suspension and controlling the drying time of the 

suspension over the solid substrate32.  

With the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, metal nanoparticles of 

different sizes and shapes have been synthesized using various methods, such as 

chemical reduction, chemical replacement, electrochemical reduction, photochemical, 

thermal decomposition, and ultrasonic decomposition methods29. The most widely 

used and the simplest method is the chemical reduction, in which a metal salt is 

reduced to metal nanoparticles in aqueous or non-aqueous solution using reducing 

agents, such as sodium citrate, NaBH433, hydrogen34 or alcohols34. Normally some 

surfactants, such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), poly(vinyl 

pyrrolidone) (PVP), or sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), are added to the solution as 

capping agents to prevent the aggregation or oxidation of nanoparticles. These agents 

have also the function of regulating the growth rate to control nanoparticles shape 

and size. The type of metal salt, reductant, surfactant and their relative 

concentration, the reaction temperature, and the solution pH influences the size, size 

distribution, the shape, and the aggregation state of metallic nanoparticles 26,29. SERS 

substrates produced by metallic nanoparticles show some advantages: easy synthesis 

and low-cost; the size and shape can be controlled by reaction conditions in order to 

obtain the desired optical properties and maximize the enhancement signal effect; 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

 

? Page 8 

 

nanoparticle aggregates can provide a higher enhancement in the specific sensitivity 

35,36.  

The methods to prepare highly ordered SERS substrates include the nanoparticle 

assembly method, the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method, and lithography. A chemical 

assembly method is used to modify the solid substrate (Si, glass, indium tin oxide 

(ITO), or Au film) with bifunctional molecules. One molecular moiety interacts with 

the solid substrate originating a compact layer and the other moiety interacts with 

the nanoparticle through electrostatic or chemical interaction to form a well-arranged 

layer of nanoparticles. Size, concentration, and surface charge of the nanoparticles, 

and the type do bifunctional molecules are the parameters of which depend the 

surface coverage and uniformity of the assembled layer. In order to prevent the 

aggregation of nanoparticles and to form a uniform substrate during the synthesis 

process, capping agents are usually added. However, the presence of the capping 

agent will lead to a large repulsion between nanoparticles and prevent the formation 

of a compact assembly layer. In the latter case, the electromagnetic interaction 

between nanoparticles is not highly effective and the SERS activity is low37. To 

overcome this problem, further growth of the nanoparticles by chemical or 

electrochemical methods has been proposed in order to reduce the interparticle 

spacing and increase the SERS activity38. The main advantage of this type of 

substrate, which gives an homogeneous SERS signal and has a significant surface 

area (up to several cm2), is that it can be produced in a normal laboratory without 

complicated equipment. An alternative method is to functionalize the Au nanoparticle 

surface with CTAB to form a positively charged molecular bilayer which subsequently 

will be deposited in an ITO substrate. This type of nanoparticles will not form 

aggregates due to bilayer positive charge in their surface. The substrate has a very 

uniform SERS signal and good reproducibility and stability. One of the limitations is 

the CTAB signal present in SERS spectra which implies poor results when this 

system is applied to detect some molecules that have weak interaction with the 

substrate or weak Raman signal. Although this method can effectively avoid the 

aggregation of nanoparticles, allowing total surface of nanoparticle interacting with 

analyte molecules, it is still difficult to obtain a defect-free surface and to obtain a 

substrate with a large area.

? Page 9 

 

All the problems above described can be solved using Langmuir-Blodgett technique 

which originally was used to prepare amphiphilic molecular films with large area on 

solid substrates39. By dissolving an amphiphilic molecule in a water-immiscible 

volatile solvent and dispersing the solution on the surface of the aqueous phase it 

forms a molecular monolayer at the interface after solvent evaporation. By changing 

the position of the movable barrier in the LB trough, one can change the density of 

the monolayer film. The film can then be deposited on the substrate by the dipping 

and pulling method. By dispersion of the solution of metal nanoparticles into the 

water phase, a layer of randomly distributed nanoparticles will be left at the interface 

after the evaporation of the solvent. As a result of compression of the layer through 

moving the barrier, an ordered layer of nanoparticles will be formed on the surface. 

During the compression process, the interparticle spacing will decrease, leading to 

strong electromagnetic coupling between nanoparticles and a significant shift of the 

LSPR band. The nanoparticle film can then be deposited on glass or a Si wafer by 

transfer to form a substrate with a surface area as large as 20 cm2. At present, the LB 

technique has been successfully used to fabricate SERS films of nanorods, nanowires, 

and spherical, cubic, cuboctahedral, and octahedral Ag nanoparticles40,41.  

Lithography of nanospheres can also be used to produce homogeneous substrates. 

Aggregates of polystyrene spheres or silica with appropriate size deposited on a 

substrate (glass, ITO glass, silica or metallic film) form a multilayer film, where 

nanospheres are highly ordered and the conditions of aggregation are controlled. The 

formed film is used as template for vacuum deposition or electrochemical deposition to 

form on the template a metal film of the desired thickness29.  

As was described, a variety of methods such as chemical functionalization or 

lithography techniques can be used to immobilize plasmonic nanoparticles uniformly 

on conventional substrates such as glass, quartz and silicon substrates (which are not 

flexible for standard use), but the substrates need to be flexible and easily processable 

for the development of low cost sensors for everyday life applications. For that reason, 

one of the future challenges ahead of researchers is the fabrication of SERS-active 

devices that bring the technology from the laboratory to real-world applications7.  

Some authors have already published some works that reveal this concern. The 

flexible substrates can be divided into plasmonic substrates for sensing, cellulose

paper-metallic nanoparticles, polymer-metal nanofiber mats, polydimethylsiloxane 

(PDMS)/plastic-metallic nanoparticles, carbon nanotube-plasmonic nanoparticles and 

graphene-metal nanoparticles7.  

Recently, electrospinning has been presented as an interesting technique used to 

directly assemble gold nanorods on aligned electrospun nanofibres42-44. Aligned 

nanofibres act as micro-and nanochannels causing preferential alignment of the 

anisotropic Au nanorods along the fibre axis, resulting in globally anisotropic 

plasmonic and SERS properties. Such massive alignment of AuNRs, combined with 

the porous polymer fibrous mat, which provides efficient access to the analyte, showed 

excellent SERS effect. It is worth noting, that even with a modest density of Au 

nanorods on the surface of the electrospun fibres, the SERS intensity was 

dramatically enhanced compared to the planar counterpart. The porous nature of the 

nanofibrous mat enables efficient sorption and transport of the analyte molecules to 

the surface of the Au nanorods facilitating the observed high SERS effect. 

 

1.3.  Carbon nanostructures 

1.3.1. Graphene and graphene oxide 

Graphene belongs to a new class of carbon nanomaterials composed by sp2 carbons 

arrange in a honeycomb structure (Figure 1.1).  

 

Figure 1.1 – Graphene 2D structure 

Several experimentally measured properties of graphene have already surpassed 

those observed in other types of materials. With enhanced electrical conductivity, high 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

? Page 11 

 

mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high impermeability to gases and 

optical transparency, graphene holds great promise as the next wonder material. 

Such an ideal is, however, achievable only if the large scale production of high quality 

graphene is attained45. 

The current state of graphene production is divided between two approaches – the 

bottom-up and top-down. The bottom-up approach seeks to build graphene sheets 

from scratch, starting with simple carbon-based molecules such as methane and 

ethanol. On the other hand, the top-down approach relies on the fundamental idea of 

extracting layers of graphene from graphite. Both methods provide graphene of 

contrasting quality and yield. However, in terms of high yield and low cost, the top-

down approach via chemical oxidation of graphite is the most convenient method to 

date. Moreover, graphene obtained via such chemical treatments is important for a 

large portion of the graphene community that endeavours to use graphene in 

applications such as composites, coatings, paint/ink, transparent conductive layers, 

bioapplications and energy storage.  

 

1.3.1.1. Graphene  

Although ?graphene? is a term widely used for a variety of carbon-based materials, 

the definition provided by IUPAC, in 1997 indicates that ?the term graphene should be 

used only when the reactions, structural relations or other properties of individual 

layers are discussed.”46. This misunderstanding happens because when graphene 

oxide is reduced it restores almost the graphene structure but a certain amount of 

oxygen groups remain in the structure, so it is important to know the differences 

between all the graphene derivatives (graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) 

and graphene itself. 

Graphene can be produced by two approaches: bottom-up or top-down. At the first 

one, graphene can growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), arc discharge or 

epitaxial growth 47-53. At the second approach, graphene is produced by 

electrochemical process, sonication or micromechanical exfoliation. In fact, the latter 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

 

? Page 12 

 

was the method used to isolate graphene monolayer and gave Physics Nobel Prize, in 

2010, to Geim and Novoselov 54. 

Graphene is a single layer of honeycomb structure of carbons with sp2 hybridised 

carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice and partially filled ?-orbitals above and 

below the plane of the sheet. However, obtaining a single layer is an extremely 

difficult process. In most cases, a structure with fewer layers of graphene is achieved 

and generally the properties refer to this group. In fact, the term ?graphene? is 

commonly used to ?monolayer?, ?bilayer? or ?few-layer?. This categorization has been 

made as the electronic properties of bi and few-layer (where ?few? is not rigorously 

defined but is generally accepted as being &amp;lt;10 layers) are distinct from the properties 

of graphite55. Besides the number of layers, the oxidation state is another important 

feature in terms of characterization. As a single layer of carbon atoms, graphene is 

the thinnest material known, yet it is impermeable to gases and it is stronger than 

steel (Young‘s modulus ~ 1TPa)56. Moreover, thermal conductivity of graphene at 

room temperature (up to ~ 5000 Wm-1K-1) rivals the values obtained for bundles of 

carbon nanotubes and is over double the next thermal conductor known, the 

diamond57. Being single layer, graphene also has an extremely high surface area with 

a theoretical value of 2630 m2g-1 and is almost transparent, absorbing only ~ 2.3 % of 

white light58. Graphene has also shown good ?foldability? recovering its electrical 

properties after bending and unbending[46].  

 

1.3.1.2. Graphene oxide 

Graphene oxide was discovered much earlier than graphene. In 1840s, Schafhaeutl 

reported the intercalation of graphite using small-molecular species, such as an acid 

or alkali metal, between the carbon lamellae; the exfoliation of graphite was made 

with sulfuric and nitric acid59. In 1859, Professor Brodie attempted to measure the 

molecular weight of the graphite. For that purpose he has used nitric acid, potassium 

chlorate and heat the mixture. The material was washed and re-oxidised under the 

same conditions up to four repetitions. The final product was termed ?graphic 

acid? and was the first sample of graphite oxide prepared experimentally60. In 1898, 

Staudenmaier improved the oxidation method by adding potassium chlorate in small 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

? Page 13 

 

portions and further acidifying the mixture with concentrated sulphuric acid. The 

final product was practically the same but more convenient since it does not require 

four repetitions of oxidation61.  

In 1958, Hummers and Hoffman presented a safer approach by using potassium 

permanganate as oxidant in a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid and sodium 

nitrate62. The Hummers method was very well received and has been adopted by 

many researchers. In an effort to improve the oxidation method, Marcano in 2010 

replaced in situ production using nitric acid with less corrosive phosphoric acid63. The 

method claimed to provide a more oxidised form of graphite oxide and highlighted a 

more intact graphitic basal-plane. Besides that, the possibility for large scale 

production of graphene oxide seems possible since the method does not involve large 

exothermic or release toxic gases45. 

In the last decade, graphene chemically modified has been the subject of intense study 

in the context of many applications such as polymer composites, energy storage and 

conversion, sensors, materials like ?paper?, field effect transistors (FET), and 

biomedical applications, due to the excellent electrical, optical, and mechanical 

properties38.  

Graphene oxide consists in stacked carbon-based sheets with many oxygen functional 

groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl, epoxide and carbonyl groups) which makes this compound 

a good candidate for the above mentioned applications. The introduction of oxygen 

functionality groups significantly alter van der Waals interactions between the layers 

and endow GO with strong hydrophilicity. The presence of these functional groups 

destroys the planar sp2 carbons of graphene and converts them to sp3 carbons by 

covalent bond to oxygen (Figure 1.2). Therefore the ?-? electronic conjugation of 

graphene is destroyed in GO, resulting in a significantly decrease in electrical 

conductivity64. 

Notably, it has been reported that the electrical conductivity of GO can be restored 

close to the level of graphene by chemical reduction64. The electrical conductivity of 

reduced GO (rGO) achieves 200 – 42000 Sm-1 depending on the reducing conditions 

(reduction time, temperature, annealing time, and annealing temperature) 65-67. The 

specific capacitance of rGO has been found significantly higher than that of GO. 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

 

? Page 14 

 

However, the dispersibility and transparency of rGO remains poorer than those of 

pure GO. The reduction process removes oxygen-containing functional groups which 

results in a decrease of rGO dispersability in different solvents. The restoration of ?-

electronic conjugation and the colour change from brown to black are the main 

reasons for the observed decrease in transparency64. 

 

 

Figure 1.2 – Graphene oxide structure and the oxygen functionality groups that can be formed after the 

oxidation process 68,69. 

 

1.3.1.3. Reduction of graphene oxide 

The reduction of graphene oxide (rGO) can be made by chemical, thermal, 

electrochemical or a combination of these processes. In the chemical reduction there 

are several chemical compounds that can be used such as: hydrazine70, 

hydroquinone71, sodium borohydride72, ascorbic acid73, or poly (sodium 4-

styrenesulfonate)74. This type of graphene oxide reduction has been efficient and is 

not an expensive process. The toxicity of the reducing agent is a concern due to the 

final applications of the reduced graphene oxide; hydrazine is one of the most toxic 

chemical used in the reduction of GO and ascorbic acid is labelled as eco-friendly 

reducer.  

Thermal reduction of GO is carried out by heating the GO in various atmospheres 

(ultra-high vacuum, Ar, H2, NH3), or with different heating sources such as 

microwave, flash light, plasma, electric current, or heated AFM tip. In this method, 

oxygen functionalities are removed in the form of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon 

monoxide. The results show that high conductivity could be achieved when GO is 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

? Page 15 

 

submitted to this type of treatment75. In comparison to chemical and thermal 

reduction, electrochemical reduction of GO is green and fast, and the reduced material 

is contaminant-free. The electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability of rGO 

produced by this method are higher than those of chemically or thermally obtained64.  

In addition to this three conventional reduction techniques, various other methods 

were used to deoxygenate GO. Cote et al. reported a chemical-free flash reduction 

process using a photographic camera flash to instantaneously deoxygenates GO by 

photothermal heating. The hydrophilicity of the flashed area was also significantly 

decreased than that of pure GO. In comparison to the three conventional reduction 

methods flash reduction is rapid, chemical-free, and energy efficient. This technique 

holds great promise for patterning GO films for device and composite applications76. 

The choice of reduction method is made according to the final application purpose of 

rGO. For example, in the case of sensors where the combination of metal 

nanoparticles and rGO are used, chemical reduction is the most suitable technique 

because this process allows the simultaneous reduction of metal nanoparticles and 

GO. 

 

1.3.1.4. Graphene characterization by Raman spectroscopy 

Raman spectroscopy has been widely used in electronic properties characterization of 

graphitic materials77-80 . Besides being non-destructive and fast, this technique allows 

the characterization in terms of layers quantification and chirality of functionality 

groups that modifies graphene 81,82. 

According to the electronic properties of graphitic materials, in Raman spectroscopy 

the main important bands are between 1200 and 3000 cm-1. At 1350, 1580 and 2700 

cm-1 are the bands denoted by D, G and 2D (or G‘), respectively 85,86 (Figure 1.3 - A). G 

band is associated to E2g phonon at the Brillouin zone center87 . D band specifies the 

defects of graphitic material analyzed83. The 2D originates from a two phonon double 

resonance Raman process and because of that is closely related to the band structure 

of graphene layers 85-88.

A rapid and precise method to determining the number of graphene layers is needed 

in order to improve the graphene research and his applications. Although atomic force 

microscopy (AFM) measurement is the most direct way to identify the number of 

graphene layers, the method has a very slow throughput. Furthermore, an 

instrumental offset of ~0.5 nm (caused by different interactions forces) always exists, 

which is even larger than thickness of a graphene monolayer and data fitting is 

required to extract the true thickness of graphene sheets86. The obvious difference 

between Raman characteristic of graphene monolayer and graphite is 2D band 

(Figure 1.3 – B). For monolayer, the 2D band can be fitted with a sharp and 

symmetric peak while that for graphite can be fitted with two peaks. The 2D band 

becomes broader and blueshifted when the number of layers increases (Figure 1.4). 

When the Raman spectrum has a sharp and symmetric 2D band it is consensual say 

that we are in the presence of a graphene monolayer 89 (see Figure 1.3 – B). 

Unfortunately, the differences in the 2D band between two and few layers of graphene 

sheets are not unambiguous in the Raman spectra. Although there are differences in 

the 2D band, the intensity of the G band increases almost linearly as the graphene 

thickness increases. This can be readily understood as more carbon atoms are 

detected for multi-layer graphene. Therefore, the intensity of the G band can be used 

to determine the number of graphene layers84.  

As was already said, graphene characteristic bands in the Raman spectrum are 

dependent on the substrate (Figure 1.5); however, this effect is not meaningful as was 

shown by Ni and co-workers84,90. Single-layer graphene (SLG) sheet was produced on 

transparent (glass and quartz), flexible (PET and PDMS), conductive materials (NiFe 

and Si) and also in most widely used substrate SiO2/Si; Raman spectrum of epitaxial 

graphene growth on SiC is also shown. The most important difference is between 

Raman spectra of epitaxial graphene growth on SiC and graphene deposited on all the 

others substrates. The first one shows a significant 2D band blueshift which can be 

explained by the strain effect of the substrate. 

The oxidation and exfoliation processes generate changes in graphene Raman 

spectrum when compared to graphite (Figure 1.6). Raman spectroscopy is a widely 

used tool for the characterization of this type of materials because the conjugated and 

double carbon–carbon bonds lead to high Raman intensities. Multi-layer graphene

oxide is the one with more differences from graphite. D and G bands are slightly more 

intense. G band is larger, and shows a shift to higher frequencies. This shift has two 

reasons: the existence of areas that were not oxidised and the resonance of double 

bond at higher frequencies than G band of graphite, being this the main reason for 

the band shift91.  

 
Figure 1.6 – Evolution of the Raman spectra during the oxidation and exfoliation processes for graphite, 

GO, and FGS (few layer graphene sheets). All the spectra correspond to an exciting laser wavelength of 

514.5 nm. The position of the G band in graphite is indicated by the vertical dashed line91. 

All the studies about carbon-based materials here presented show the importance of 

Raman spectroscopy in structural studies useful to distinguish graphene and 

graphene oxide, mono- or multi-layer.

The Figure 1.7 shows the growing interest of graphene-based nanocomposites by 

researchers and their effort to improve this nanomaterial as an efficient SERS 

substrate. 

In 2010, a new material was used as active-SERS substrate: graphene. Ling and co-

workers9 used graphene to detect popular molecules widely used as a Raman probe: 

phthalocyanine (Pc), rhodamine 6G (R6G), protoporphyin IX (PPP), and crystal violet 

(CV). Such molecules were deposited equally on graphene and a SiO2/Si substrate 

using vacuum evaporation or solution soaking.  By comparing the Raman signals of 

molecules on monolayer graphene and on a SiO2/Si substrate, it can be observed that 

the intensities of the Raman signals on monolayer graphene are stronger than on 

SiO2/Si, indicating a clear Raman enhancement effect on the surface of monolayer 

graphene. In the case of solution soaking, the Raman signals of the molecules are 

visible even though the concentration is low to 10-8 mol dm-3 or less while there is only 

a fluorescence background from the SiO2/Si substrate. The intensities decrease with 

an increase in the number of graphene layers and the signals are not observed on 

graphite and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The Raman enhancement 

factors were between 2 and 17 and were calculated by taking the signals on the 

SiO2/Si substrate as references, and they were dependent on the symmetry of the 

molecules. This was the first report about the Raman enhancement on the surface of 

graphene and this work was a contribution to the SERS phenomenon explanation 

especially in terms of charge transfer between the analyte and the substrate. 

Although the positive results with graphene as SERS substrate, the enhancement 

factors were not high enough for practical applications. For that reason, a 

combination of graphene with plasmonic nanoparticles can be foreseen for the design 

and fabrication of novel devices with sensing capabilities11.  

 

1.4.1.1. Association of metal nanoparticles with graphene 

nanostructures 

Xu et al12 have reported the first study using graphene and silver nanoparticles. In 

such report, silver-nanoparticle films using graphene oxide sheets as substrates were

prepared through the silver-mirror reaction. The enhanced Raman signal of graphene 

oxide sheets in the composites indicated the SERS activity of such silver particle 

films, and the degree of enhancement could be controlled by adjusting the density of 

the silver particles. Such SERS-active silver films may hold some advantages as 

generic SERS substrates for the study of a variety of target molecules, for example, 

the structural and electronic characteristics of graphene oxide sheets. Additionally, 

these studies also indicate the feasibility of using graphene oxide sheets as substrates 

for the preparation of nanoparticle films, including metal, semiconductor, and 

insulating particle films.  

 

 

Figure 1. 8 – Scheme of nucleation and formation of gold nanoparticles on graphene oxide sheet surface11. 

 

The first report using graphene and gold nanoparticles as SERS substrate was 

published by Gonçalves et al11. In this work, was shown that the presence of oxygen 

functionalities at graphene surface provides reactive sites for the nucleation and 

growth of gold nanoparticles (Figure 1. 8). Gold nanoparticles are effectively grown at 

functionalized graphene surfaces using a simple chemical method in aqueous 

medium. The nucleation and growth mechanism depends on the degree of oxygen 

functionalization at the graphene surface sheets, no gold nanoparticles were obtained 

at totally reduced graphene surfaces. Additionally, these studies have shown that the 

graphene/gold nanocomposites act as substrates for surface enhanced Raman 

scattering.  

After these two major contributions to developing new SERS substrates based on 

graphene and metallic nanoparticles, other publications have shown the potentialities 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

? Page 21 

 

of this type of nanocomposites as sensors. Only in the last two years, about 80 papers 

were published on the subject. 

Gold and silver nanoparticles are the metallic nanoparticles that were used in almost 

all the works with graphene and SERS. Also, Ga92, Pd93 and Cu94 were used to 

decorate graphene sheets in order to enhance Raman scattering. The introduction of 

Ga nanoparticles on graphene sheets allows the study of charge transfer and 

plasmonic coupling contribution to the enhancement of Raman modes of graphene. 

Besides that, Ga nanoparticles on graphene/SiC show a surface plamon resonance 

that can be tailored from UV to the visible range92. CuGO nanocomposites were 

prepared by a reduction in situ using NaBH4 as reducing agent. The copper 

nanoparticles on graphene surface produced by this method were distributed 

homogeneously with a controlled size94. The study of the introduction of Pd 

nanoparticles on graphene sheets surface was made in comparison to Au 

nanoparticles. Fu et al. have shown that Pd nanoparticles have not the plasmonic 

properties to enhance the Raman scattering because as SERS substrate they were 

considerably weaker than graphene and Au93.  

The investigation of metal nanoparticles and graphene composites has evolved to 

achieve greater enhancement factors. For this, the use of gold and silver nanoparticles 

with shapes different from spherical95 has been greatly explored as well as the 

combination of these two metals in a single composite96. Popcorn-shaped gold 

nanoparticles were attached on graphene sheets and this hybrid material was used to 

detect HIV DNA without any labeling. Furthermore, experimental data with this 

novel SERS substrate show excellent reproducibility of the SERS signal97. Gold nano-

pyramids were deposited on graphene surface to develop a biocompatible SERS 

platform that enables single molecule detection and provides a reproducible and 

uniform response. This shape of gold nanoparticles generates a high density of ?hot 

spots? with SERS enhancement factors over 1010. Gold nanoparticles were also tuned 

as hexagonal and triangular on graphene by thermally annealing between 600 and 

800 ºC and their growth is dependent on the number of layers. The platform based on 

graphene and these so-called gold islands exhibit excellent SERS effect on Raman 

spectra of few-layer graphene with the enhancement factors up to several hundreds98. 

In Lee work99 it is possible to see that gold nanospheres, nanorods and nanooctahedra 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

 

? Page 22 

 

assembled on graphene sheets by electrostatic interactions show SERS evidence. In 

this study, nanorods have the highest enhancement factor of the three types of gold 

nanocrystals synthesized99. Gold-silver-graphene (Au@Ag-G) composites were 

prepared and are SERS-active substrates100,101.  

The nanocomposites based on graphene and metal nanoparticles are mostly produced 

by chemical reduction of both graphene oxide and a metal salt because the chemical 

reduction of graphene oxide is easier to obtain in large-scale. Moreover, the oxygen 

functionalities of graphene oxide allow the nucleation of metal nanoparticles and, 

consequently promote a good dispersion of these nanoparticles on the graphene sheet 

surface11. Some of the chemical reducing agents used are sodium citrate11, ascorbic 

acid102, tannic acid103, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)104, and etilenoglycol93. Gum 

arabic, a natural polymer, was also used to exfoliate graphene sheets and reduce 

silver nitrate into silver nanoparticles105.  

 

1.4.1.2. Different structure of SERS substrates based on 

graphene nanocomposites 

The enhancement of Raman scattering may be promoted by a substrate containing 

plasmonic nanostructures, originating the SERS effect. As was mentioned in SERS 

sub-chapter, lithography is described as the best technique to make the substrates 

with this feature and to have the best results in terms of enhancement factors. 

However, this technique is expensive and requires specific laboratory equipment. 

There are studies where metal nanoparticles were deposited on a support and 

graphene single-layer was deposited on the top of such nanoparticles. Wang has 

shown a hybrid SERS-active platform consisting in a single layer of graphene 

covering quasi-periodic Au nano-pyramid arrays. The hexagonally arranged sharp Au 

tips, almost identical in size and topology, support markedly enhanced local fields and 

play a key role in the ultrahigh sensitive system. The tipped substrate can be 

fabricated in large scale with superior reproducibility106. Another example of using 

direct imprint is described in the paper of Long107.  Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 

substrates were imprinted by using porous anodic alumina (PAA) stamps with 

featuring periodic hexagonal cells, which were followed by evaporation of gold films. 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

? Page 23 

 

The topography was tuned to optimize the enhancement factor by adjusting the of 

gold deposition time. Then a single-layer graphene covered the optimized gold 

nanostructures serving as the passivation layer; the final material exhibit significant 

SERS enhancement107.  

To overcome the disadvantages of lithography, some researchers have applied the 

functionalization of graphene with metal nanoparticles in order to create an active-

SERS substrate with a very good dispersion of plasmonic nanostructures and aligned 

spacing interparticle. Chitosan (CS) was used to functionalize the surface of graphene 

oxide sheets. The negatively charged silver nanoparticles are disposed to form 

aggregates on GO/CS via electrostatic interaction, which is extremely beneficial to the 

SERS detection of aromatic molecules and the final composite remarkably enhance 

the main peaks of l-phenylalanine, in comparison with the silver nanoparticles alone, 

showing great potential for biomedical applications108. In other work, silver 

nanoparticles are attached to graphene functionalized with N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl) 

ethylenediaminetriacetic acid trisodium salt (TETA). With such a substrate, p-

aminothiphenol (p-ATP) and melamine were detected with concentration as low as 2 × 

10?8 and 2 × 10?7 M by SERS109. A globular protein, ?-lactoglobulin (BLG), was also 

used to decorate reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGO) and the obtained BLG-RGO 

composite that can be dispersed in aqueous solution with pH-sensitive solubility. Due 

to the adsorption of ?-Lactoglobulin on the surface of graphene sheets, the BLG-RGO 

composite was further used as template for Au nanoparticles assembly. These Au 

nanoparticles assembled on the BLG-RGO composite were shown to yield a large 

SERS enhancement for Rhodamine 6G110. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) 

(PDDA), a polyelectrolyte, was used to functionalize graphene oxide sheets which 

were decorated with silver nanoparticles. The GO/PDDA/AgNP composite was used 

successfully to detect folic acid with ultrahigh sensitivity. In fact, with this substrate 

it was possible to detect folic acid in water in a concentration of 9 nmol dm-3 111.  

In order to develop a specific sensor to detect 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), the surface 

of silver nanoparticles were modified with p-aminothiophenol (PATP) and after that 

were supported on graphene sheets. This SERS substrate allows the detection of TNT 

with concentration as low as 10-11 mol dm-3 112. Other example of nanoparticle surface 

modification is the functionalization of gold nanoparticles with 2-mercaptopyridine. 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

 

? Page 24 

 

These modified nanoparticles were then attached on graphene oxide and reduced 

graphene oxide sheets via ?-? stacking and other molecular interactions113.  

In most of the examples mentioned the physical structure of the SERS substrate is as 

colloidal suspension or as deposited on some solid support, such as SiO2/Si. Only a few 

attempts were made towards fabricating flexible plasmonic devices using such 

assembled graphene – plasmonic particle nanocomposites, despite the fact that 

graphene or graphene oxide can be easily processed into free- standing flexible 

substrates 12,114. For example, Xu et al.12 demonstrated the fabrication of flexible free-

standing metal nanoparticle films using a graphene oxide substrate by simply drying 

the concentrated graphene oxide–metal nanoparticle dispersion on a glass substrate. 

More recently, Xu et al.114 reported a new kind of flexible SERS substrates, the so 

called G-SERS (graphene-mediated SERS) tape by depositing Au nanoparticles on 

atomically flat graphene by vacuum thermal evaporation. In such SERS tapes, the 

??hot spots‘‘ that are generated in the deposited Au nanostructures by strong LSPR 

coupling through the single layer graphene render the graphene surface a hot surface 

for SERS. They also observed that the SERS signals from G-SERS were cleaner than 

those of pure Au nanoparticles on rigid SiO2 substrates. Such substrates could be used 

for real time analysis of samples and they were even reusable by washing the 

substrate after the measurement. Other example was shown by Li et al. where a 

flexible reduced graphene oxide paper modified with silver nanoparticles was used to 

detect R6G with a concentration of 10-8 mol dm-3. this type of SERS substrate is easy 

to process in large scale and also acts as a portable antibacterial substrate115. As these 

substrates are flexible, they could be useful for the ultrasensitive detection of any 

contaminants on substrates that are not flat. The field of graphene– plasmonic 

nanoparticle composites is relatively new and there is plenty of room for exploring the 

large scale fabrication of low cost flexible plasmonic sensing devices based on flexible 

graphene– plasmonic composite substrates7.

1.4.1.3. Graphene-surface enhanced Raman scattering 

(GERS) 

As was already mentioned, graphene itself show an enhancement in the Raman signal 

of some molecules9, phenomenon called by some authors as Graphene Surface-

enhanced Raman scattering – GERS. But it can be said that the main advantage of 

the use of graphene as SERS substrate is the research about chemical enhancement. 

There are some works which use only graphene, others use graphene and metal 

nanoparticles and even others compare graphene to its derivatives in terms of SERS 

results.  

The enhancement of Raman spectral features of graphene itself was studied using 

metal nanoparticles. The Au nanoparticles improved spectroscopic characterization by 

quenching fluorescence, allowing the graphene D and G bands to be quantified, and 

yielding a surface enhancement 93,116,117.  Also SERS of graphene was studied using a 

modified Au electrode. In the latter system, both D- and G-band wavenumbers 

linearly depend on the potential applied. The effect was explained in terms of changes 

in the C-C bond length induced by electrochemical doping118. Other approach of 

graphene SERS is made with the use of silver nanoparticles. The Ag deposition on 

graphene induced a large enhancement in the Raman signal and caused a shift in the 

characteristic bands positions 119,120. Other parameter that was also used to 

characterize graphene by Raman spectroscopy is the ratio of the intensities of D and 

G bands (ratio D/G) which increased when graphene was deposited on Ag substrate121.   

Graphene as SERS substrate by itself was firstly shown in the work of Ling et al9. 

The enhancement of Raman peaks of some dyes were compared between graphene 

single-layer and SiO2 substrates and the results have showed a clear enhancement 

with graphene indicating the Raman enhancement effect on the surface of monolayer 

graphene. With this system, Raman enhancement factors were taking using Raman 

intensity ratios. The Raman enhancement factors were quite different for different 

peaks, changing from 2 to 17, and can be distinguished through three classes that 

correspond to the symmetry of the molecular vibrations. This enhancement was 

attributed to charge transfer between graphene and the molecules, which result in a 

chemical enhancement. After this study there were some others to improve this 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

 

? Page 26 

 

concept. The enhancement factors were shown to be dependent of the reduction time 

of graphene oxide and SERS spectra of RhB molecules on reduced graphene oxide 

reproduced all important spectral fingerprints of the molecule with a negligible 

frequency shift122. Copper phtalocyanine (CuPc), a planar molecule, was used to 

investigate the effect of molecular orientation on the intensity of chemical 

enhancement using graphene as SERS substrate. In this work it was shown that the 

stronger the interaction, the more the Raman signal is enhanced, and the analyte-

substrate interaction depend on the different molecular orientation of the analyte. 

Besides their contribution to understand the chemical enhancement this work has 

shown that the magnitude of the chemical enhancement can be used to evaluate the 

degree of interaction between the molecules and graphene123. Other contribution to 

chemical enhancement studies was developed by Yaghobian et al., where graphene 

sheets are used to enhance Raman signals of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) with 

reproducible enhancement factors124 . R6G was the molecule chosen to study 

systematically charge transfer on graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene 

oxide. Although their structural similarity, the three different substrates have shown 

different spectral features due to different enhancement contributions from the local 

chemical groups and the global ?-conjugation network of the substrates. The Raman 

signals of R6G were increased with the number of GO layers, while shown inverse 

trend when graphene and reduced graphene oxide were used due to a dominant ?-? 

stacking mechanism. The absence of electromagnetic enhancement and the rich 

chemical structure makes GO an excellent choice as a tunable substrate in order to 

study the chemical enhancement resulting from the adsorbent-substrate 

interaction125. 

Finally, Sil et al.126 query the existence of SERS phenomenon using graphene. The 

work has shown Raman signals of different analytes adsorbed on carbonaceous 

materials, such as, chemically reduced graphene, graphene oxide (GO), multi-walled 

carbon nanotube (MWCNT), graphite and activated carbon. The analytes selected for 

the study were Rhodamine 6G (R6G) (in resonant conditions), Rhodamine B (RB), 

Nile blue (NBA), Crystal Violet (CV) and acetaminophen (paracetamol). All the 

analytes except paracetamol absorb and fluoresce in the visible region. Raman signals 

were due to resonant effect, with fluorescence suppression (in the case of fluorescent 

samples) owing to efficient adsorption on various carbon substrates. The enhanced 



? 1. Carbon nanostructures: novel components for SERS substrates 

? Page 27 

 

signals observed at 10-9 mol dm-3 concentrations for R6G are more due to the 

resonance effect rather than surface enhancement by the carbon substrates. Using 

this results it was shown that chemically synthesized graphene is ??really‘‘ not a 

unique substrate for observing surface enhanced Raman signals. The results 

described, including the data from multiwalled carbon nanotubes, indicate that the 

possibility of Graphene induced surface enhanced Raman effect and the fluorescence 

quenching effect are open questions126. 

 

1.4.2. Carbon nanotubes 

Carbon nanotube (CNT) is theoretically described as a cylinder fabricated of rolled up 

graphene sheet. It can be divided into a single or multiple walls. Nanotubes with a 

single wall are, commonly, denoted by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and 

were first reported in 1993127 while the ones with more than one wall are multi-walled 

carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and were first discovered in 1991 by Iijima128.  

These one-dimensional carbon allotropes are of high mechanical strength, rich 

electronic properties, high surface area, excellent chemical and thermal stability129. 

Such properties allow CNT be explored in many research fields: biomedicine (artificial 

implants, tissue engineering, cancer cell identification)130,131, energy132-134, 

electronic135,136  and sensor devices137,138. As in graphene research, also CNT have been 

exploited when functionalized with metal nanoparticles. These nanocomposites can be 

applied in catalysis, fuel cells or chemo/biosensors139. The last application can be made 

by using electrochemical measurements or SERS identification technique140. 

In SERS, the functionalized CNT were used dispersed in solution141, as an endoscope 

tip142,143, specifically functionalized for use as an intracellular probe144,145 or vertically 

aligned in a silicon support146-148. Vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes 

(VAMWCNT), or CNT forests, functionalized with gold nanoparticles showed highly 

sensitive SERS signals at very low target concentration down to 10 fmol dm-3 due to 

the high-density of gold nanoparticles, in a unit volume, by the densification of 

nanotubes149. Moreover, the design of 3D gold covered VAMWCNT SERS substrates 

on silica supports allows the patterned arrays for multiplex SERS detection148.

Besides the advances in SERS detection using VAMWCNT arrays and the good 

results obtained, it still has a long way to optimize and fabricate uniform 3D SERS 

substrates. 

 

1.5. Aims of the thesis 

Based on the potential of SERS in the detection of biomolecules and the 

characteristics of carbon nanostructures, the research presented in this thesis was 

directed toward the development of nanostructures that can be a contribution to 

active SERS substrates. 

The approach of getting closer the real world and the research work was one of the 

concerns in this project. The development of SERS substrates that could be used 

without restrictions and in a practical way in the chemical analysis laboratory was 

always present throughout the work. To this end, also the materials used in the 

synthesis of the nanoparticles, as well as the basis used to support graphene and 

nanoparticles were eco-friendly. 

The general objectives of this work are: 

1) Development of carbon nanocomposites based on the in situ synthesis of metal 

nanoparticles using graphene oxide. Optimize the synthesis procedure testing several 

reducing agents.  

2) Evaluation of the performance of graphene nanocomposites in SERS, using several 

supports, a variety of analytes and different Raman setups.  

3) Development of rigid structures that can support well distributed metal 

nanoparticles to enhance the Raman signal of molecular analytes. Optimize the 

process of polymeric membranes synthesis using the freeze-thawing technique and 

electrospinning. Introduce graphene nanocomposites in membranes produced by 

electrospinning in order to contribute for an enhancement of the detection limit of the 

tested analytes.

5) Optimization of the production of vertically aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes 

(VAMWCNT) covered with gold to achieve the best conditions to assess SERS activity 

for the detection of biomolecules.

2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer 

composites as SERS substrates for 

nucleic acid and DNA detection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This chapter focuses the importance of the morphology of SERS substrates to achieve 

the best enhancement in the Raman signals of biomolecules. 

Here, a novel method to prepare composites of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with silver 

nanoparticles,  is proposed. The silver nanoparticles are prepared using sodium 

citrate (Ag1) and glucose (Ag2) for silver (I) reduction. The synthesis in situ of silver 

nanoparticles in PVA (Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA) and subsequent crosslinking by freeze-

thawing allows a good distribution of silver nanoparticles through the membranes. 

The drying time of hydrogels, the interaction time between the analyte and substrate, 

and the detection limit are parameters that are here evaluated for two different types 

of hydrogels of PVA and silver nanoparticles. 

Both types of substrates allow the detection of nucleic acids and DNA in two 

conformations (double stranded and single stranded). The positive results obtained 

with Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA for nucleic acids and DNA, after four months of the 

preparation of hydrogels, indicate the stability of such SERS substrates.

2.1. Introduction 

Detection of chemical and biological agents plays a pivotal role in medical, forensic, 

agricultural and environmental sciences.1-3 Sensitive methods that allow 

identification of biomarkers such as proteins and nucleic acids at early state disease 

provide the prospect of better health and more effective therapy.4 Technological 

platforms that provide sensors of high sensitivity, selectivity and stability are 

therefore in high demand. In particular, efforts are required for the development of 

efficient sensors with the ability to detect analytes in complex biological fluids like 

blood, urine, serum, etc.5,6 

Since its discovery in the seventies, SERS (Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering) has 

received increasing attention from researchers, not only because of its high sensitivity 

and the small volume of sample needed, but also due to the possible wide 

applicability. 7-9 Compared with normal Raman signals, SERS scattering cross-

sections of molecules residing at or near the surface of roughened or nanostructured 

materials may be enhanced by factors up to ?1014 or close to that of fluorescence. 10 

This huge enhancement factor arises from the strong light-induced electric field at 

locations in metallic nanostructured spaces, often called ??hot spots‘‘, which offer 

opportunities to develop ultrasensitive SERS-based biosensors. 2,11 In addition to high 

sensitivity, SERS features narrow Raman bands that lead to minimal background and 

favour multiplexing assays. Also, Raman scattering is insensitive to humidity, 

oxygen, and foreign species that often induce fluorescence quenching, making SERS a 

particularly suitable tool for applications in different environments. Consequently, 

SERS is recognized as one of the most promising tools for ultrasensitive chemical and 

biological analysis with the target of attaining the single-molecule level. 2,11,12 

For SERS, the emphasis to achieve strong enhancement is how to get a good 

substrate. The development and use of highly reproducible substrates is critical in the 

advance of SERS as a mainstream spectroscopic technique. This is particularly 

important in studies of large, complex molecules such as DNA or proteins, because the 

SERS signal in these molecules also depends significantly on molecular conformation, 

orientation, and binding specificity to the substrate surface. 13,14 Three major factors 

determine the quality of SERS substrates: the enhancement factor, the 

reproducibility, and the fabrication complexity.15

As SERS spectra of molecules adsorbed on metallic nanostructured films are much 

more stable and reproducible when compared with those in metal colloidal 

suspensions, there is much interest in the development of solid SERS substrates with 

large Raman enhancements and good reproductibility.16,17 Several technologically 

demanding or costly approaches like electron beam lithography or focused ion beam 

milling are applied for fabricating SERS substrates with varieties of nanostructures; 

however these are too expensive for practical application.18,19 The implementation of 

SERS as a widespread analytical tool requires large-scale manufacture of new 

substrates that, among other features, are inexpensive, easy to implement in diverse 

analytical contexts and of easy processing.20 

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) could be considered as a good host material for metal and 

semiconductor nanoparticles, due to good thermo-stability and chemical 

resistance.21,22 PVA hydrogels prepared by a physical method, so called freezing-

thawing, are totally discharged from toxicity, have greater mechanical strength and 

elasticity than the gels produced by other processes, besides having a high swelling 

degree, and do not need a particular apparatus for its preparation.23,24 

In the present work we describe the use of PVA as a silver nanoparticles (AgNP) 

supporting solid membrane. AgNP were prepared in situ, in the presence of PVA, by 

reaction with two environmental friendly reducing agents: sodium citrate25 and 

glucose26. The obtained Ag-PVA composites were characterized by UV-vis 

spectrometry and SEM analysis and their ability to be used as active SERS substrates 

was tested first with rhodamine 6G (R6G). A systematic study was developed in order 

to optimize the drying conditions of the Ag-PVA composite and the interaction time 

between the analyte solution and the substrate before SERS detection. The limit of 

detection of the R6G with respect to each substrate was also determined.  

The optimized Ag-PVA composites were then tested to detect nucleic acid bases 

(adenine - A, cytosine - C, guanine - and thymine G - T) and deoxyribonucleic acid 

(DNA) in its two conformations (single stranded - ssDNA, and double stranded - 

dsDNA) with distinguished sensitivity and uniformity.

2.2. Results and Discussion 

 

2.2.1. Characterization of Ag-PVA substrates 

Ag-PVA hydrogels were prepared by freeze-thawing, a simple technique that produces 

3D polymeric networks able to support metallic nanoparticles.27 Here, this 

methodology was applied by exposing an aqueous suspension of PVA and silver 

nanoparticles to repeated cycles of freezing at -20 ºC and thawing at room 

temperature. This process results in the formation of crystallites, due to the folding of 

PVA chains, that serves as physical crosslinks to render the material insoluble in 

water.28 The organization of the PVA molecules is almost random and the areas filled 

with water molecules create a porous structure 29,30 as seen in Figure 2.1. where the 

porous microstructure is observed in the PVA composite after lyophylization. This 

simple method is done without need for specific equipment or additional chemical 

agents that could influence further SERS results with this substrate such as trace 

detection. 

The Ag-PVA hydrogels were prepared using two different reducing agents for the 

silver ions, sodium citrate (Ag1-PVA) and glucose (Ag2-PVA). Figure 2.1). shows the 

SEM images of PVA, Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA immediately after its preparation (indicated 

by 0 h) and lyophilization. The SEM image of PVA alone shows a very porous and 

reticulated microstructure. The preparation of PVA composites with silver changes the 

porous structure of PVA. Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA composites look more compact and 

with a different porous organization as shown in the SEM images (Figure 2.1). The 

presence of silver nanoparticles is not very clear in the SEM images, in particular for 

Ag1-PVA it seems that the silver nanoparticles are imbibed in the PVA structure.

Figure 2.1 – SEM image of PVA membranes dried by lyophylization 

 

The Ag-PVA hydrogels were dried both at room temperature (RT) (for 5, 24, 48 and 72 

h after preparation, respectively) and at 105 ºC (for 3h). The aim was to analyze the 

influence of the presence of water inside the 3D structure of the composites and the 

consequent swelling degree of its PVA matrix, when using the composites as SERS 

substrates. After drying, the SEM images show clearly the silver nanoparticles at the 



? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection 

? Page 47 

 

composites surface (Figure 2.2). A porous morphology is also shown for both 

composites, not regular in porous size or shape. The Ag1-PVA composite shows a 

lower amount of Ag nanoparticles than Ag2-PVA, according to the preparation 

methods in which it was used 3.6 and 8.9 mmol Ag+ per g PVA, respectively. The Ag 

nanoparticles in Ag1-PVA are smaller than in Ag2-PVA, when the composites were 

dried at RT. Drying at 105 ºC originates the smallest Ag nanoparticles (Figure 2.2) 

 In these images it is shown that there are silver nanoparticles at the composites 

surface and possibly they are also at inner layers. Regarding the silver nanoparticles 

size, shape and distribution, the SEM images suggest that the Ag1-PVA composite 

has a lower amount of Ag nanoparticles than Ag2-PVA, being the size and shape of Ag 

nanoparticles in Ag1-PVA not so well defined as in Ag2-PVA, where the presence of 

Ag nanorods together with spherical nanoparticles is observed. Also the presence of 

some nanoparticle agglomerates randomly distributed is observed in both cases. 

Furthermore, the presence of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the membranes of 

PVA becomes more intense with increasing drying time and drying at 105 ° C (Figure 

2.2). 

Figure 2.3 shows that an increase in the drying time at RT, originates an increase in 

the amount of silver particles observed at the composites surface, better noticed in the 

SEM images shown of Ag2-PVA, which contains a larger percentage of silver. This 

effect is possibly due to shrinking of the PVA matrix while drying. PVA shrinking 

could originate a migration of the Ag particles towards the PVA surface where they 

tend to aggregate. The Ag particles aggregation or growth is clear from the increase in 

particle size when comparing the SEM image after 48 h drying with the one after 24 h 

drying at RT (Figure 2.3). After 72 h drying at RT, the SEM images of Ag2-PVA show 

two distinct regions, one with small spread Ag particles and other with much bigger 

aggregates, as depicted in Figure 2.3. Drying at 105 ºC originates a quicker process, 

with shrinking of the PVA matrix and migration of the Ag nanoparticles to the 

surface, but without growing and aggregation of the Ag particles (SEM images for 

both Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA in Figure 2.2, for Ag2-PVA also in Figure 2.3 for 

comparison purposes). The latter effect is also supported by the SERS results shown 

below, and will be further discussed, with the composites dried at 105 ºC being the 

best SERS substrates. The porous nature of the composites shown in Figure 2.2 and 



? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection 

 

? Page 48 

 

Figure 2.3, makes also possible the presence of Ag particles inside the pores and at 

the inner surface of the material, in particular for Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA dried at 

105ºC that show the smallest Ag particles (Figure 2.2).

The reflectance spectra of the two substrates dried at different conditions, recorded in 

a UV-VIS spectrometer in the solid state, are plotted in Figure 2.4. In these spectra 

two main absorption bands are observed, the PVA band at lower wavelengths (a band 

at 274 nm is referred for pure PVA27) and the Ag nanoparticles band at higher 

wavelengths (around 400 nm). The minimum of reflectance of the PVA band was 

found to be sensitive to the drying of the matrix presenting a red shift as the polymer 

is becoming drier (Figure 2.4). This trend is observed for both substrates, being the 

values of the minimum of %R detected for higher wavelengths in the case of Ag2-PVA. 

This could be attributed to a lower transparency of the Ag2-PVA caused by a higher 

content of Ag nanoparticles as may be inferred by the colour of the wet membranes 

(insets in Figure 2.4) and also in agreement with SEM analysis (Figure 2.2). With 

respect to Ag nanoparticles peak reflection values, the results differ between Ag1-PVA 

and Ag2-PVA substrates. In the Ag1-PVA substrate, the minimum of reflectance 

values of the band attributed to Ag undergo a slight blue shift with the drying 

process. For the Ag2-PVA substrate, the minimum reflectance values for Ag are 

detected for lower wavelengths and there is not a defined variation with the drying of 

the substrate. The mean value of 397 nm for the minimum of reflectance is close to 

the reported value of 395 nm observed in pure Ag colloids and is characteristic of the 

plasmon resonance absorption for Ag spheres in water31. Though, in the SEM analysis 

(Figure 2.2) Ag nanorod structures were also observed. From the literature, rod-

shaped silver may present two main absorption bands: longitudinal plasmon 

resonance at ~ 570 nm for smaller length, and a transverse plasmon mode (at ~380 

nm) for higher length, and it is referred that as the length of the nanorods grew with 

time, the longitudinal plasmon resonance essentially disappear32. So, in this case the 

obtained spectra probably present the result of the contributions from some isolated 

Ag spheres together with rods contribution from the transverse plasmon mode. 

 

2.2.2. SERS results 

To register the SERS spectra, 10 µL of an aqueous solution of the analyte was added 

to a small portion of solid substrate (around 5x5 milimiters) and dried in air at room 

temperature. For comparison purposes, the Raman spectrum of a drop of the analyte 

in a glass slide was also recorded, after dried in air at room temperature. In the latter 



? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection 

 

? Page 52 

 

case, the spectrum obtained corresponds to the Raman of the solid analyte, very 

distinct from the SERS spectrum, the intensity depending on the solution 

concentration. 

 

2.2.2.1. Influence of substrate drying time in SERS signal 

The substrates Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA were prepared and dried both at 105 ºC (in an 

oven for 3 hr) and at RT for 0, 3, 5, 7, 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively.

? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection

The substrates were tested for SERS just after the drying time was over (or after 

cooling down to RT, when it was heated at 105ºC), with 10 µL of a 10-3 mol dm-3 

aqueous solution of R6G. The first 7 hours of drying time testing were planned to 

confirm if there was any influence of the substrate water content on the SERS signal 

of the analyte. Since during this period there was not a significant effect, longer times 

were used (24, 48 and 72 h) so that the amount of water within the hydrogel could 

further decrease (the drying process can be followed just by looking at the sample 

aspect that goes from a wet gel to a dried flat solid). The drying process in an oven at 

105ºC was performed to assure that no water remained in the hydrogel structure of 

those substrates. The results show that, in fact, the drying time after preparation (or 

the drying temperature) influences the analyte detection by SERS (Figure 2.5).

Immediately after preparation, the Raman spectra of the hydrogels Ag1-PVA and 

Ag2-PVA (Figure 2.6) show a set of bands that could not be identified. The first 

attempt to identify these bands was running a SERS of the PVA hydrogel itself in an 

aqueous silver colloid, but no similarities were found with this SERS spectrum 

(Figure 2.7). The same pattern was observed in the Raman spectra recorded during 

the first seven hours of substrate drying time at room temperature. After 24 h drying 

no Raman signal was detected for Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA. Also, there was no 

significant Raman signal from the hydrogels dried at 105ºC (Figure 2.6).

colloid for comparison purposes (b). 

 

For the evaluation of SERS activity in Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA, when varying the 

drying time or when dried at 105 ºC, a solution of R6G 10-3 mol dm-3 was used as 

analyte (Figure 2.5). In the Raman spectra recorded for R6G in the several substrates 

obtained during the first seven hours of drying time at room temperature (Figure 2.5 

b-e), the previous pattern was still observed, as obtained without addition of R6G 

(Figure 2.5 a and Figure 2.6). After 48 hours drying, only the characteristic SERS 

bands of R6G are clearly obtained both in Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA substrates (Figure 

2.5 e). For the hydrogels dried at 105ºC, a good quality SERS spectrum was also 

obtained for R6G (Figure 2.5 f).  



? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection 

? Page 55 

 

For both composites, if at the beginning of RT drying it seemed that the Ag particles 

were imbibed in the PVA matrix (SEM images in Figure 2.1), and could not be 

reached by the analyte, it seems that after 48 h there are plenty of Ag particles 

available that show the right aggregation state to become SERS effective (SEM 

images in Figure 2.2). This is shown by the SEM images and by the Raman spectra 

that start to show the SERS signal of R6G with a drying time of 48 h (that was not 

shown at 24h drying). 

A completely dried substrate seems to be required to obtain the SERS spectrum of the 

analyte. Before drying the composites, the Ag particles seem to be imbibed in the PVA 

matrix and silver surface may be occupied (originating the Raman signal observed) 

and thus cannot be reached the adsorption of by the R6G molecules, which adsorption 

is blocked. The initial set of bands for the wet gel (Figure 2.6), similar in Ag1-PVA 

and Ag2-PVA, is possibly due to polymer or other retained in contact. SERS spectra 

from R6G were obtained for both Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA substrates after 48h drying 

or dried at 105ºC. The substrates used for further testing were those dried at 105ºC 

(assuring complete dryness) that showed the smallest silver nanoparticles and for 

which the best SERS signals of R6G were obtained. 

 

2.2.2.2. Influence of interaction time between analyte and 

substrate in SERS signal 

Since these new Ag-PVA substrates have a three-dimensional porous structure, it is 

important to assure that there is time for contact between the R6G analyte molecules 

and the metal nanoparticles inside the reticulated PVA support, before running the 

Raman spectra.  

The following study aims to evaluate the interaction time between the analyte and 

the substrate that will possibly originate the best SERS signal. R6G (10 µL of aqueous 

R6G 10-3 mol dm-3) was added to Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA substrates, respectively, that 

were previously dried at 105ºC. Raman spectra were collected after the following 

times: 0, 1, 3, 24 and 72h (Figure 2.8). R6G characteristic bands are visible in the 

SERS spectra immediately after addition of R6G to both Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA 

substrates. The R6G bands intensity increases for both substrates increasing the time 



? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection

of interaction until 3 h. The SERS spectra obtained after 24 h are better defined. It is 

very interesting that after 24, or even 72 h, the SERS signal can still be observed from 

the R6G/Ag-PVA samples, almost without changes. When colloids are used to record 

SERS from distinct analytes, colloid aggregation usually occurs after 10 to 30 minutes 

and the SERS signal can no longer be observed.

Figure 2.9 – Evaluation of SERS detection limit for R6G in Ag1-PVA (A) and Ag2-PVA (B) (both 

previously dried at 105ºC; interaction time analyte-substrate of 96 h in all spectra.). Raman spectra of 

the substrate only (a), and SERS from a R6G solution with the concentrations 10-3 (b), 10-5 (c), 10-6 (d) 

and 10-7 (e) moldm-3, respectively, in both substrates. 

 

substrates Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA dried in 105ºC and after 96 hours analyte 

incubation in substrates. As the previous results showed that the trend is the higher 

incubation time more defined spectra are, therefore it was decided to study the limit 

of detection of these substrates after 96 hours of interaction between the polymeric 

composite and R6G. The initial concentration was 10-3 mol dm-3 because was tested 

before in these two types of substrates with positive results. In Figure 2.9, we can see 

that the characteristic peaks of R6G (1650, 1450, 1300, 1190 and 600 cm-1) are present 

in SERS spectrum for 10-3 mol dm-3 R6G aqueous solution when we used Ag1-PVA. 

For a concentration of 10-5 mol dm-3 of the same analyte, only 1650 and 1450 cm-1 

bands are present in the SERS spectrum, using also Ag1-PVA. In the case of Ag2-

PVA, it can be seen that the same characteristic peaks of R6G, observed for Ag1-PVA 

with analyte solution in concentration of 10-3 mol dm-3, are present when we used also

R6G in 10-3 and 10-5 mol dm-3. The peaks 1650, 1450, 1300 and 1190 cm-1 remain 

present in the SERS spectrum of concentration 10-6 mol dm-3 but are not present in 

the 10-7 mol dm-3. 

In conclusion, the SERS detection limit of R6G aqueous solutions for Ag1-PVA is 10-5 

mol dm-3 and for the substrate Ag2-PVA it is 10-6 mol dm-3. This result may is possibly 

be related with the higher amount of silver nanoparticles in Ag2-PVA be the substrate 

with more quantity of silver nanoparticles. 

 

2.2.2.4. DNA and nucleic acids detection 

The specific detection of DNA has gained importance in recent years because the 

number of DNA sequences of different organisms is being determined. Such sequence 

information can be used for the identification of the genus or species of 

microorganisms, diseases, or even a single individual. Fast and reliable DNA 

detection is not only used in research and development, it also finds increasing 

applications in areas like forensics, food safety control, and agriculture33.  

SERS offers several advantages for the detection of biomolecules: it is a rapid non-

destrutive tool, it yields compound-specific information, and has the potential for 

multi-component analysis33. But recent advances in the research of DNA 

identification has been made through the use of substrates produced by using complex 

techniques and expensive such as nanolithography, and using DNA chain with a 

specific constitution of oligonucleotides34 or a pre-treatment35,36. Besides, many 

existing DNA discrimination assays exploit the use of a synthetically attached label 

group that is used to detect hybridization and/or follow DNA denaturation 37-39. This is 

a common problem with many DNA detection and discrimination assays, where the 

time, difficulty, and expense of synthetically pre-treating a target analyte greatly 

diminish their effectiveness. To this end, there has been a growing interest in ?label-

free detection?, that is, the detection and discrimination of DNA without the 

requirement to synthetically pre-treat the DNA to be detected prior to analysis40. 

After testing a standard molecule (R6G) successfully in these new SERS substrates, 

in different experimental conditions and with different limit detections, DNA in the 



? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection 

? Page 59 

 

two conformations (double stranded – dsDNA and single stranded – ssDNA) and its 

bases (adenine - A, cytosine - C, guanine - G and thymine - T) were applied as analyte. 

This work presents two substrates which identify the DNA into its two conformations, 

as well as their constituent bases without any pre-treatment, fluorescent label or 

design of oligonucleotide chain. The DNA and their bases are used as received by 

provider. In addition, the substrates are produced from a simple technique without 

requiring specific equipment.  

In general, all DNA bases were detected by both studied substrates. The identification 

of the analyte, in this case, depends on its structure and on the substrate used (Figure 

2.10). Adenine has two peaks for the Ag2-PVA, one of them well defined, and for Ag1-

PVA has only one peak. Ag1-PVA substrate is a good substrate to identify cytosine 

and thymine; on the other hand, with Ag2-PVA was possible identify also these bases 

and the guanine. The wavenumber of the main peaks relating to adenine (730 cm-1), 

cytosine (795 cm-1), and guanine (650 cm-1) (Figure 2.10; Table 2.2) in observed SERS 

spectra are in agreement with the values found in literature41. Regarding thymine, in 

published works it is verified that this is the DNA basis with lower resolution in the 

SERS spectrum. Badr et al 42conducted a study of thymine SERS spectrum on the 

silver nanowires surface in which used the 1064 nm laser and the obtained values of 

wavenumber are consisted with those found in this study, with two substrates.  

SERS spectra of ssDNA (10-3 mol dm-3) were obtained with both Ag1-PVA and Ag2-

PVA substrates; for dsDNA SERS was obtained with Ag1-PVA only (Figure 2.11).  As 

it can be seen in Figure 2.11, the substrate Ag1-PVA allows identification of the basis 

constituents of ssDNA: 733 (A), 970 (C), 1170 (T) and presumably 1279 cm-1 (G). The 

value assigned to guanine is in agreement with the value found in the SERS spectrum 

of this base from the substrate Ag2-PVA. These values are in accordance with the 

results obtained by Green et al43, where analyzes the SERS spectra of oligonucleotides 

composed only by one of the bases (oligo A, oligo C, oligo G and oligo T).  In the case of 

the Ag2-PVA, the two peaks observed in the spectrum of ssDNA (731, 1320 cm-1) refer 

to adenine. Also this is the only base identified when the DNA is in a double helix 

conformation and using the Ag1-PVA substrate.

Figure 2.10 – SERS of nucleobases (10-3 moldm-3 aqueous solution) using Ag1-PVA (A‘) and Ag2-PVA 

(B‘) substrates (both previously dried at 105ºC; interaction time analyte-substrate of 72 h in all spectra). 

The characteristic bands of nucleobases are labeled in the corresponding SERS spectra: adenine (A), 

cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). 

 

The dominance of adenine modes observed in the SERS spectra is not due to the 

abundance of adenine base nor to its relative proximity to metal nanoparticles13.  The 

731 cm-1 band is assigned to a breathing mode; and the multi-component band 

peaking at 1320 cm-1 is assigned to mixed in-plane stretching motions of the six-

member ring (ring skeleton vibration)43 and indicates the denaturation of DNA44, 

which is the treatment used in this experiment to produces ssDNA from double 

stranded DNA.

Single stranded DNA is more easily detectable than dsDNA with SERS technique due 

to its high surface affinity for metallic surfaces based on electrostatic interactions. So 

ssDNA has greater number of exposed bases, therefore an increased signal intensity 

is generated34.  This is the reason why we were able to better detect ssDNA than 

dsDNA.

2.2.2.5. Stability of the substrates for nucleobases detection 

Besides the reproducibility, the SERS substrates should be stable for a long period of 

time. In this work the stability of the substrates and its reproducibility were tested. 

The same substrates Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA previous described were tested four 

months after its preparation. The nucleic acids aqueous solutions at 1×10-3 moldm-3 

and DNA (single stranded and double stranded) were the analytes chosen to perform 

these experiments. The analytes solutions were freshly prepared. 

Generally, both SERS substrates remain its activity. All the nucleic acids (adenine, 

cytosine, guanine and thymine) were identified (Figure 2.12). In fact, not only the 

same peaks present in Figure 2.10  are present at SERS experiments performed after 

four months but there are some new ones. SERS spectrum of adenine shows the peak 

at 731 cm-1 detected by Ag1-PVA substrate and other two: 999 and 1323 cm-1. On the 

other hand, in adenine SERS spectrum using Ag2-PVA is very similar to those 

acquired four months earlier. The detection of cytosine only have three peaks 

registered in this step of the work; at Ag1-PVA was not detected the peak around 

1144 cm-1 and the peak 1026 at Ag2-PVA. The guanine has a peak at around 1000 cm-

1 which is not present in Figure 2.10, when Ag1-PVA was used; the Ag2-PVA was not 

able to detect the peaks at 853 and 1352 cm-1. The peak around 1300 cm-1 of thymine 

was not present in the SERS experiments performed four months earlier neither the 

peaks present in such SERS experiment was not present in Figure 2.12 (for Ag1-

PVA). In the case of Ag2-PVA, thymine shows two peaks at 900 and 1435 cm-1.

Figure 2.12 – SERS of nucleobases (10-3 moldm-3 aqueous solution) using Ag1-PVA (A‘) and Ag2-PVA (B‘) 

substrates (both previously dried at 105ºC; interaction time analyte-substrate of 72 h in all spectra). The 

characteristic bands of nucleobases are labeled in the corresponding SERS spectra: adenine (A), cytosine 

(C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These experiments were performed after four months of substrates 

preparation. 

 

The situation that occurred to ss and dsDNA (Figure 2.13) was similar to those 

nucleobases. The single stranded DNA showed the peaks 1331 and 1370 cm-1 besides 

those that were present when the substrates were used immediately after its 

preparation, for Ag1-PVA. In the substrate Ag2-PVA, the peaks at 806, 845, 955, 1443 

and 1512 cm-1 are now present besides the other two that were identified at SERS 

spectrum four months earlier. The double stranded DNA aqueous solution was the 

analyte that showed more peaks besides those were showed at SERS spectra of Ag1-

PVA and Ag2-PVA, immediately after its preparation.

Figure 2.13 - SERS of ssDNA (a) and dsDNA (b) using Ag1-PVA (A) and Ag2-PVA (B) (substrates 

previously dried at 105ºC; interaction time analyte-substrate of 72 h in all spectra) after four months of 

substrates preparation.  

 

 

2.3. Conclusions 

PVA hydrogel membranes impregnated with silver nanoparticles were prepared using 

the freeze-thawing process. Two different reducing agents (sodium citrate and 

glucose) were used to prepare the Ag nanoparticles. The final materials were 

designated as Ag1-PVA and Ag2-PVA, respectively. 

The SERS activity of these membranes was studied using rhodamine 6G as probe 

molecule. The parameters studied, that could affect the SERS activity were: the 

membrane drying time; the time of interaction between the analyte and the 

membrane; and detection limit of the membranes. 



? 2. Ag-Poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer composites as SERS substrates for nucleic acid and DNA detection 

? Page 65 

 

The best SERS results were achieved when these polymeric matrix were dried at 105 

ºC for 3 hours. The SERS signals could be obtained for long time of interaction with 

the membranes, almost without changes. The probe molecule showed that Ag1-PVA 

had a limit detection of 1×10-5 and Ag2-PVA of 1×10-6 moldm-3 for this analyte.  

These membranes were demonstrated to be good substrates to detect nucleobases and 

DNA in two conformations, single and double-stranded. Although the characteristic 

peaks of these analytes were not present in both types of Ag-PVA substrates(Ag1-PVA 

performed better), the adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine were detected in each 

substrate. The same conclusions can be taken for the cases of ssDNA and dsDNA.  

The substrates of Ag-PVA showed a good stability for long time. Moreover, the nucleic 

acids solutions and DNA were detected four months after preparation of the polymeric 

matrices.  

The proposed polymeric membranes are promising potential in SERS-based detection 

and stable SERS substrates. Furthermore the Ag-PVA membranes are easy to handle, 

to prepare, are low cost and environmental eco-friendly.  

 

2.4. Experimental Procedure 

 

2.4.1. Preparation of Ag-PVA hydrogels 

Hydrogels45 containing 14 wt% PVA were prepared from silver nitrate solutions using 

two different reduction methods (method 1, sodium citrate reduction;25 method 2, 

glucose reduction26).  

Method 1: 7 g of PVA was added to an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.5 mmol dm-3, 50 

mL) and the suspension formed was heated with stirring until it reached 80ºC. Then 

3.76 mL of sodium citrate 0.085 M was added dropwise and the suspension was kept 

stirring at 80ºC during 3 hours, after which a clear solution was obtained.  

Method 2: a solution of AgNO3 (0.01 mol dm-3, 0.0839 g in 50 mL of H2O) was 

prepared. D-(+)-glucose (1.2 g) was added to the solution and sonicated for 5 minutes.

After, 1 mL of ammonia aqueous solution (25 % weight) was added, followed by 5.6 g 

of PVA. The final suspension was heated at 80 ºC for 3 hours, with stirring. 

Freeze-thawing technique was used to promote crosslink of the polymer. The gel 

produced was distributed in glass containers (±1 g) and submitted to three cycles of 

freeze–thawing (-20ºC, +20ºC), promoting the cross-linking. After this process was 

complete, some of the obtained membranes were dried at 105 ºC, showing a rigid 

structure like a film, and the other ones were stored at +5º.  

 

2.4.2. Preparation of analyte solutions 

Aqueous solutions of adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, ssDNA and dsDNA 10-3 mol 

dm-3 were prepared. To prepare ssDNA the solution of dsDNA was heated at 90 ºC for 

20 minutes and cooled in ice immediately after. Both types of DNA solutions were 

prepared without using any buffering agent. 

 

2.4.3. SERS measurements 

For testing both substrates in terms of interaction time and limit of detection we used 

R6G solution in different concentrations, and 10 µL of each solution was placed on the 

surface of the substrates.  For SERS measurements of nucleic acids, also 10 µL of each 

solution was placed on the membrane and remained in interaction for 72 hours. The 

Raman spectra and SERS were recorded using a Bruker RFS100/S FT-Raman 

spectrometer (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm excitation).

The synthesis of well exfoliated graphene oxide (GO) was a fundamental step for this 

research work. The method chosen to prepare GO was reported by Marcano, because 

it starts from the exfoliation of graphite flakes with chemical agents, that at the end 

allows to obtain large-area GO sheets with a high quantity of oxygen functional 

groups. These characteristics are of major importance for the synthesis the noble 

metal nanoparticles at the GO surface (NPs-GO). 

During the preparation of the NPs-GO nanocomposites, the GO surface is reduced, 

because of that we considered of importance the study of the reduced GO (rGO) 

properties with the same chemical agents used to prepare the nanocomposites. 

The characterization of the as-prepared GO showed that the nanomaterial had a good 

exfoliation and oxidation degree. It was found that the degree of reduction of the GO 

surface depend on the chemical agent used.

3.1. Introduction 

The development of simple, ultrasensitive, highly selective and cost-effective 

biosensing platforms is essential for biological assays and clinical diagnostics. 

Biosensor platforms used for diagnosis purposes would benefit greatly from the 

development of new graphene-based nanocomposites due to the unique physical and 

chemical properties of graphene1-6.  

Recently, numerous graphene-based biosensing platforms have been reported to 

detect different biological molecules on the basis of various mechanisms being the 

enhancement of Raman signal one of them7-10. 

Graphene, the two-dimensional sheet of sp2-hybridized carbon, shows excellent 

electrical conductivity, high transparency and flexibility. Such particular 

characteristics has inspired many of the envisage future applications of graphene 

such as sensor-devices, roll-up and wearable electronics, energy storage materials, 

polymer composites, and transparent electrodes11. Because of this plurality of 

applications, in the last years, the production of graphene has been a hot topic in the 

scientific community. Several methods have been developed such as micromechanical 

exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)12, chemical vapour 

deposition13,14, epitaxial growth, unzipping of carbon nanotubes by chemical, 

electrochemical or physical methods15-17, each of these methods presenting advantages 

and disadvantages. 

Although, the previously referred methodologies able the production of high quality 

graphene sheets, most of them present the disadvantage of low production rate, high 

cost of the process and the need of specific apparatus which are not available in all the 

laboratories18. For these reasons, indirect methodologies to prepare graphene at a 

higher mass production rate, lower cost and without the need of special equipment, 

were explored based on the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). GO is obtained after  

the exfoliation of graphite powder in the presence of oxidant compounds and strong 

acids, following methodologies described by the Brodie19, Staudenmaier20, Hummer21 

or Marcano22. The purpose of the oxidation is to introduce oxygen-containing 

functional groups into the basal structure of graphene sheets. The oxygen groups are 



? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction 

? Page 74 

 

introduced to reduce the Van der Walls force between the carbon layers within 

graphite, as well as to improve the stabilization of the resulting nano-sheets in water. 

The majority of the methods uses then ultrasonication treatment to enforce the 

exfoliation of GO into monolayers. GO can be then reduced to graphene using 

different chemical agents23 or thermal treatments24. The basic strategy involve the 

complete exfoliation of GO into individual GO sheets followed by their in-situ 

reduction to produce individual graphene-like sheets.  

However, as refereed before, in chapter 1, the quality of the final graphene sheets 

obtained from the reduction route of GO is not as high as the quality obtained from 

the physical methodologies, due to some defects that remain in the carbon network 

after the reduction process. That is the reason why these methodologies are avoided to 

produce graphene for applications where the conductive properties of graphene are 

essential25. Reduced GO (rGO) is not perfect graphene with lower electricity, because 

small amounts of functional groups remain in the basal structure and defects (holes) 

in the carbon network. 

However, the intermediary carbon phase, GO, that presents an hydrophilic character 

due to the large number of oxygen-containing functional groups generated during the 

oxidation process is of great interest, mainly from the chemical point of view, since 

these groups allow the implementation of traditional chemistry methodologies to grow 

different organic and inorganic structures at GO surface26,27. This form of graphene 

may develop into the cheap precursor of choice to yield processable graphene in large 

quantities. In conclusion, the benefit of GO is its high potential to be the most 

versatile starting material for the preparation of functionalized graphene. It was first 

shown by Gonçalves et al10, that the presence of the oxygen-groups at the surface of 

GO allows the nucleation and growth of the metallic nanoparticles in the carbon 

network. Since the GO surface has a large number of oxygen-containing functional 

groups28, the distribution of the metallic nanoparticles at its surface can be 

successfully achieved. This approach is a possibility to prepare the so-called platforms 

that can be tested as SERS substrates because the electromagnetic sites (provided by 

the noble metal nanoparticles) are well distributed on the carbon network, which is a 

major requirement to obtain a good Raman signal enhancement. However, other 



? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction 

 

? Page 75 

 

applications for metal nanoparticles dispersed on graphene have already shown 

enhanced catalytic activity as well as novel optoelectronic properties29. 

In this work, and for the reasons previously exposed, we have prepared and used GO 

to promote the synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles at its surface. For this 

purpose we needed to select a reducing agent to promote simultaneously the reduction 

of the metallic ions and of the GO. There are several reducing agents referred in the 

literature23, and our selection was based on the use of eco-friendly reducing agents, 

whenever it was possible. 

Following these objectives we choose sodium citrate30,31 and D(+)-glucose32,33, which 

are the most common ones for gold and silver nanoparticles production. Additionally, 

we used natural sugars and phenolic compounds present in Eucalyptus globulus 

Labill bark aqueous extracts to prepare the nanoparticles at GO surface34. 

Furthermore, and based on a recent work published by Nergiz S.Z. et al35 we also 

tried to prepare gold nanostars at GO surface using in this case, hydroxylamine, as 

reducing agent36. Hydroxylamine has a high reduction capability but weak reactivity 

with water and other solvents that make it an appropriate reductant for the GO 

reduction in aqueous suspension36. In resume, four different reducing agents were 

used to prepare the metal nanoparticles-GO nanocomposites. 

In this chapter we present the results of the preparation and characterization of the 

GO used in this work. Initially, we present the morphologic characteristics of the as 

prepared GO evaluated by SEM, TEM and AFM. The evaluation of the chemical 

composition and structure of the same GO is then presented in the following section 

together with the reduced GO materials by the different chemicals, for a more clear 

comparison. The main idea is to evaluate the capacity of each of the selected 

chemicals to reduce the GO nanosheets, that is, to restore the ?-network.

3.2 Results and Discussion 

3.2.1. Synthesis and morphological characterization of 

graphene oxide  

Graphene oxide with two-dimensional structure was successfully prepared via the 

Marcano‘s method22 described in the section 3.4.1. Synthesis of graphene oxide (page 

93). 

Briefly, we started from graphite flakes (Figure 3.1(a)), the oxidation procedure was 

applied and followed by an intensive washing procedure. After a suitable ultrasonic 

treatment, such exfoliation can produce stable dispersions of very thin GO sheets in 

water. The GO product obtained exhibited the traditional brown colour (Figure 3.1(b)). 

It still retains a layered structure, but is much lighter in colour than graphite due to 

the loss of electronic conjugation brought about by the oxidation37.  

The aqueous GO solutions can be then lyophilized to obtain GO in the dry state, that 

is constituted by fluffy powder with a very large volume as exemplified in Figure 3.1(c). 

 

Figure 3.1 – Photographs of (a) graphite flakes, (b) GO aqueous solution and (c) dried GO by 

lyophilisation. 

The morphology and structure of the dried GO nanosheets was investigated by SEM 

and TEM. Figure 3.2 presents representative SEM images of free-standing GO 

nanosheets with lateral sizes bigger than 3 ?m, revealing a crumpled and rippled 

structure which can result from the drying process. The TEM images obtained are 

characteristics of single to few layers of graphene sheets (Figure 3.3). The presence of 



? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction 

 

? Page 77 

 

corrugations (signed with the arrow in the high magnified image) results from 

stresses created during the transference of this nanomaterial to the TEM grids and 

also because of drying, as referred before.

magnifications. 

 

Figure 3.3 – Transmission electron micrographs of graphene oxide at lower (LEFT) and higher (RIGTH) 

magnifications. 

AFM analysis of GO deposited on a silica substrate, revealed the presence of sheets 

with uniform thickness (?1.3 nm; an example is shown in Figure 3.4). These well-

exfoliated samples of GO contained no sheets either thicker or thinner than the 

referred value, leading to a conclusion that an efficient exfoliation of GO down to few-



? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction 

? Page 78 

 

layers GO sheets was indeed achieved under these conditions. While a pristine 

graphene sheet is atomically flat with a well-known van der Waals thickness of ?0.34 

nm38, GO sheets are expected to be thicker due to the presence of covalently bound 

oxygen and the displacement of the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms slightly above and 

below the original graphene plane.

3.2.2. Chemical reduction of graphene oxide with different 

reducing agents and its characterization 

The chemical agents used for the reduction of graphene oxide involved two chemicals 

traditionally used to prepare silver or gold nanoparticles. These were sodium citrate 

and glucose. Another two chemical were also used, a natural extract of Eucalyptus 

Globulus prepared by the members of the research team and hydroxylamine, a 

chemical with the particularity to promote the growth of gold nanostars, under 

particular chemical medium conditions39. 

A representation of the chemical structures of the previous referred molecules is 

shown in Figure 3.5.

The specificity of each of the methodologies involved in the different reduction 

processes is described in the experimental section at the end of this chapter. 

Hereafter, we present the results of the structural characterization of GO in 

comparison with reduced GO (rGO) by the diverse methods. 

 

3.2.2.1. UV-vis spectroscopy 

The formation of stable aqueous rGO dispersions enables the reaction process to be 

monitored using UV-vis spectroscopy. According to the literature, GO presents two 

UV-vis absorption peaks centered at 230 and 300 nm, which decay gradually with the 

increase of reduction, eventually disappearing depending on the reduction degree40. 

Meanwhile, a new absorption peak show up around 264 nm, and red-shifted with the 

reduction efficiency, also the absorption in the whole spectral region may increase41, 

indicating that the electronic conjugation within the reduced graphene sheets was 

revived upon reduction of graphene oxide42. It can be readily observed that the 

reduction causes a change in colour from yellow (GO) to black (rGO) in water. 

The UV-vis spectra of GO and reduced GO with the different chemical reducing 

agents is represented in Figure 3.6.

Figure 3.6 – Absorbance spectra of GO and rGO obtained with sodium citrate, glucose, hydroxylamine 

and eucalyptus extracts. 

The UV/Vis spectrum of GO exhibits the two characteristic peaks, a maximum at 230 

nm, which corresponds to ?-?* transitions of aromatic C–C bonds, and a shoulder at 

300 nm, which is attributed to n-?* transitions of C=O bonds43,44. The rGO produced 

by hydroxylamine, follows the disappearance of the GO peaks with the presence of a 

new peak at 266 nm corresponding to rGO according to literature. The observation of 

the curves corresponding to the GO reduction particullarly with hydroxylamine and

sodium citrate, but also with Eucalyptus extracts shows an increase of absorption in 

the whole spectral region providing a first hint that the GO might be reduced and the 

aromatic structure might be restored40. Finally the curve corresponding to the GO 

reduction by glucose seems to maintain the original GO characteristics peaks (~230 

and 320 nm), together with the appearance of the rGO peak at around 270 nm. Also, 

in this case the absorbance of the GO peak at around 230 nm is very high, when 

compared with the others. 

 

3.2.2.2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of GO and rGO obtained 

with the different chemical agents are shown in Figure 3.7. 

In all the spectra, we observe a strong and broad absorption peak between 3000 –3700 

cm-1 in the high frequency area corresponding to the stretching and bending vibration 

of OH groups of water molecules adsorbed on the materials45.  

Based on the literature and specifically starting with GO the attribution of the peaks 

is as follows:  the C=O stretching of COOH groups situated at edges of GO sheets are 

present at 1726 cm-1. The absorptions due to the O–H bending vibration, epoxide 

groups and skeletal ring vibrations (sp2-hybrided C=C) are observed in the range of 

1500-1600 cm-1 46. The absorption at 1393 cm-1 may be attributed to tertiary C–OH 

groups. The C-O stretch from epoxy groups is responsible for a peak at 1232 cm-1 and 

finally, the alkoxy C-O stretch is visible at 1060 cm-1 47,48.

Figure 3.7 – FTIR spectra of GO and rGO reduced with the different chemical reducing agents.  

With the reduction methodologies applied to GO, it was expected that the intensity of 

peaks associated to the oxygen functional groups would significantly diminish or even 

disappear, concomitantly with the restoration of the sp2-hybrided C=C. However, as 

can be observed in Figure 3.7, the oxygen functional groups are still present, being 

difficult to conclude if there is a reduction of oxygen presence or not based on these 

spectra. Yet, the rGO produced from hydroxylamine treatment shows the most visible 

differences. A strong peak is visible at 1568 cm-1, this can be attributed to C=C 

stretching vibration, the other broad peak centred at 1200 cm-1 is possibly the sum of 

the contributions from remaining C-O from epoxy and alcoxy groups. 

The FTIR spectrum of rGO_glucose shows more peaks than those attributed to GO 

structure. Such presence of these peaks can be explain by the adsorption of glucose at 

the surface of GO.

3.2.2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis 

The decomposition profiles of these samples could be understood as consequences of 

the different oxidation states of the carbon structures. The thermogravimetric (TG) 

and the corresponding differential TG (DTG) curves of the samples obtained under 

nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 ºC min-1 are shown in Figure 3.8 and Figure 

3.9, respectively.  

All the samples show a slight mass decrease from room temperature to 100 °C 

attributed to adsorbed water. In the case of GO, a significant decrease from 150 °C to 

200 °C caused by pyrolysis of the oxygen-containing functional groups, generating CO, 

CO2 and stream is observed. The mass of GO slowly further decreased up to 620 °C 

along with burning of GO by dehydration of carboxyl and epoxide groups. The 

temperature at which the decomposition of carbon sheets takes place is related to the 

integrity of the sp2 system. Since GO has a broken sp2 system, the thermal stability of 

carbon sheets is poor and GO decomposes totally at a quite low temperature with 

little residual graphene49. 

After the reduction treatment of GO with the different chemical agents, the removal 

of the thermally labile oxygen functional groups by chemical reduction results in 

much increased thermal stability for the reduced GO. It is expected that the system, 

partially or totally recovers the integrity of the sp2 system, depending on the 

reduction method. This fact should lead to restoring the additional thermal stability. 

Regarding the reduction with sodium citrate, there is an initial mass decrease at 

around 100 ºC due to water adsorption. The mass loss at 300 ºC corresponding to a 

very sharp DTG peak seems to be attributed to the loss of adsorbed citrate ions50 at 

rGO surface. Small mass decrease peaks are observed that when compared with the 

initial GO material corresponds to a much lower presence of oxygen-containing 

functional groups, indicating a high reduction degree. The thermal stability of this 

material is much higher than GO, indicating a good level of reduction.

Figure 3.9 – DTG curves of GO and rGO reduced with sodium citrate, glucose, eucalyptus extract and 

hydroxylamine. 

 

Concerning glucose, the TG curve shows a continuous mass loss until the maximum 

temperature tested (800 ºC). The initial two mass loss peaks corresponding to water 

and oxygen functional groups presents a displacement to higher temperatures when

compared to GO, this may indicate that some glucose molecules are adsorbed at rGO 

surface. This appears to be confirmed by a decomposition phase around 300 ºC which 

matches the temperature of thermal depolymerization of the polysaccharide51.  

The TG and DTG curves of the GO reduced by the Eucalyptus extracts follow the GO 

thermal behaviour with some small mass peak loss deviations. However, the total 

amount of labile oxygen functional groups is considerable lower in the reduced form. 

The reduction with hydroxylamine shows the most thermally stable rGO, suggesting 

that a significant amount of the water and labile oxygen groups were removed by the 

hydroxylamine reduction. 

 

3.2.2.4. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy 

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to elucidate the 

evolution of oxygen groups and confirm their degree of removal upon reduction 

treatment, also to determine the nature of the residual oxygen containing functional 

groups that remain after reduction and to clarify how the reduction treatment affects 

the electronic structure of GO. 

The typical C 1s spectra of the samples surface under study are represented in 

Figures 3.10 and 3.11, also the deconvolutions of the C 1s spectra are represented in 

these figures. The relative concentrations of surface functional groups obtained from 

the deconvolution of the C1s XPS regions are summarized in the Table 3.1. The 

attribution of the chemical groups to the peak positions was done according to the 

literature28,52,53.  

The deconvolution of the C 1s XPS spectrum of the GO sample (Figure 3.10) show the 

presence of three different types of carbon bonds, with peaks centred at 285.0, 287.0 

and 288.6 eV, corresponding to C=C/C–C, C–O/C-OH, and C=O/COOH groups, 

respectively53. From the Table 3.1, the determined ratio C/O is 0.7 which allows to 

verify the predominance of the carbon atoms in the oxidized state.

The rGO_SC exhibits a significant decrease of the peak intensity for the C-O/C-OH 

(from 49.4 at% in GO to 17.9 at% in rGO_SC), an increase of the peak intensity for the 

C=C/C–C (from 40.7 at% in GO to 69.1 at% in rGO_SC), and an increase of the C/O 

ratio (0.7 to 2.2 (Table 3.1)) which is indicative of GO reduction. However, there was an 

increase of the C=O band at 288.3 eV (from 9.9 at% in GO to 13.1 at% in rGO_SC) 

which derives from sodium citrate absorption on the surface of rGO, in good 

agreement with TG results. 

With respect to rGO_HDA, the ratio C/O of 4.4 clearly indicates the higher 

deoxygenation of the initial GO (Table 3.1). In the case of rGO_HDA is possible 

identify separately the groups C=C and C-C (Figure 3.10). An increase of the quantity of  

C=C and C–C (from 40.7 at% in GO to 76.5 at% in rGO_HDA) is observed together 

with a decrease of the oxygen groups (C-O/C-OH from 49.4 at% in GO to 18.7 at% in 

rGO_HDA and the disappearance of C=O/COOH in rGO_HDA). It should also be 

noted that a new peak emerges at 286.3 eV corresponding to the C-N bonding 

resultant from the functionalization of GO surface by hydroxylamine chemical 

treatment53.  

In the case of rGO_EE sample an increase in the intensity of the peak attributed to C-

C/C=C bonds at 285 eV is observed (Figure 3.10). However the ratio C/O has the same 

value (0.7) as the GO sample. Moreover, rGO_EE shows an increased peak intensity 

for the C-O/C-OH band at 286.6 eV (from 49.4 at% in GO to 55.6 at% in rGO_EE) and 

a decreased intensity for the C=O band at 289 eV (from 9.9 at% in GO to 4 at% in 

rGO_EE). This can be explained by the possible interactions of EE molecules with GO 

structure. The EE are composed by several types of sugars and phenolic compounds34, 

what difficult the identification of the possible interactions. In the same way, the 

sample rGO_glucose didn‘t allow obtaining credible XPS data. The curves are shown 

in Figure 3.11, however as can be observed, in this case there is an increase of the 

oxygen functional groups, what does not correspond to a reduction reaction. The 

explanation for this fact can be, once more, related with the interaction of glucose 

with GO surface.

3.2.2.5. Raman spectroscopy 

The reduction of GO may be evaluated by the D/G peaks intensity ratio of the Raman 

spectra. The variation of the relative intensities of G band to D band in Raman 

spectra of GO during reduction usually reveals the change of electronic conjugation 

state. This change suggests an increase in the number of sp2 domains with the 

reduction of GO54. 

To analyse the best performance of the reducing agents in reduction of GO, we 

analysed the D and G bands of the Raman spectra. For such analysis, previously was 

made the normalization of GO, rGO_SC, rGO_EE, rGO_G and rGO_HDA regarding 

the maximum of G peak. After that the fit of each band was made according to the 

type of curve. The function more appropriate to fit D band is the Lorentzian and to fit 

G band is the Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF), since G band is an asymmetric curve caused 

by its resonant dispersion55.  

The ratio ID/IG is the most commonly used parameter to identify the reduction degree 

of GO, however recently another parameter was introduced which can also be helpful 

for this evaluation: the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of D peak55. The G 

peak has a complex origin that produces an asymmetric curve which is difficult to fit 

whereas D peaks fit the Lorentzian shape well. For that reason, the FWHM of (D) was 

chosen as new parameter to assess the reduction degree, as mentioned above.  

The Raman spectra presented in this chapter were obtained using the lasers of 488 

nm and 1064 nm (Figure 3.12 and Figure 3.13, respectively). The latter is not widely used 

to characterize graphitic materials; however this was the one most available for the 

present thesis work.  

The Figure 3.12 show the two parameters ID/IG and FWHM (D) as a function of FWHM 

(G). The positions of the G bands are also inserted as function of two parameters 

chosen. The values of FWHM (G), obtained with Raman curves from the compounds 

analysed with Raman laser of 1064 nm, decrease as ID/IG increases by the following 

order: GO, rGO_SC, rGO, EE, rGO_G and rGO_HDA (Table 3.2). This tendency is also 

followed when FWHM (G) is shown as a function of FWHM (D).

GO reduction increases as follows: rGO_EE, rGO_SC, rGO_G and rGO_HDA. Also 

this series can be observed when FWHM (G) is evaluated as function of D band width. 

However, in the latter case, it seems that the reduction of GO are similar for rGO_EE 

and rGO-SC. The ID/IG values obtained using Raman laser of 488 nm (Table 3.3) reveal 

that sodium citrate is more effective than eucalyptus extracts in the reduction of GO.

The Figure 3.14 shows the mapping (25 spectrum of each sample; the acquisition 

points are 40 µm from each other) and ?Raman images? obtained from GO, rGO_SC, 

rGO_EE, rGO_G and rGO_HDA.  

The homogeneity of the reduced samples can be observed by mapping images. The 

changes of the colour in the graphics show the changes in ID/IG. The image mapping of 

GO, rGO_EE and rGO_HDA are the most homogeneous. Besides, the mapping of 

rGO_SC shows a great change of colours its statistic values of ID/IG is similar to the 

results obtained after the fitting of D and G bands. In the case of rGO_G, the 25 

spectra were not acquired due to the inhomogeneity of the film. However, the results 

obtained with the possible spectra revealed a statistic value of ID/IG , once again, close 

to the obtained with Lorentzian and BWF fitting of D and G peaks.  

From the present analysis and based on these parameters, it is possible see that the 

higher rGO was obtained with glucose and hydroxylamine. 

 

3.3. Conclusion 

Graphene oxide was produced showing a good exfoliation (~1.3 nm of sheet thickness), 

a lateral size bigger than 3 µm and the oxygen-functional groups were confirmed by 

FTIR spectrum.  

Hydroxylamine proved to be the most effective reducing agent of the set of chemical 

agents selected to reduce GO. This conclusion was confirmed by all characterization 

techniques (UV-vis, FTIR, TGA, XPS and Raman). Raman and UV-vis spectra showed 

that glucose seems the second more effective chemical agent to reduce GO; however 

this sugar was adsorbed at the surface of GO sheets as was seen in the results 

obtained by the techniques of FTIR, TGA and XPS.  

In the case of the sodium citrate and eucalyptus extracts, the Raman analysis was not 

clear in what was the best to restore sp2 C network whereas X-ray Photoelectron 

Spectroscopy results showed that sodium citrate was more efficient. However, the 

eucalyptus extracts show the same behaviour as glucose and was adsorbed at GO 

surface as was seen in FTIR spectra.  



? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction 

 

? Page 93 

 

With the previous results it is possible to highlight the good quality of GO produced at 

the laboratory and conclude that the reducing agents used showed different efficiency 

in restoring the sp2 carbon network of GO. Not all the oxygen functional groups were 

removed using these chemicals, under the experimental conditions used, and some of 

the chemicals were adsorbed at the final rGO material. 

 

3.4. Experimental procedure 

3.4.1. Synthesis of graphene oxide 

GO was prepared by Marcano‘s method22. Briefly, 360 mL of H2SO4 were added to a 

mixture of 3 g of graphite flakes and 18 g of KMnO4. 40 mL of H3PO4 were added to 

previous mixture very slowly. After 24 hours with stirring, the high viscous 

suspension formed was carefully added to ice. Then 10 mL of H2O2 were added and 

the suspension was heated to 50 ºC, 4 hours and after that was in sonication 1 hour. 

The product obtained was filtered several times and washed with deionized water. In 

order to obtain a GO suspension with pH 6 – 7, the filtered suspension was submitted 

to dialysis. 

 

3.4.2. Reduction of graphene oxide 

rGO_sodium citrate. A suspension of 0.15 mg/mL of GO (50 mL) was heated until 

80 ºC, after 1.880 mL of sodium citrate (0.085 mol dm-3) was added dropwise. The 

experimental conditions were maintained during 1 hour.  

rGO_glucose. 1.2 g of D-(+)glucose was dissolved into 40 mL of a suspension of GO 

(0.75 mg/mL). The mixture was in sonication about 5 min. Then, 1 mL of ammonia 

(25%) was added and the final suspension was again in sonication, during 5 min.  

rGO_eucalyptus extract. 70.75 mg of eucalyptus extract was added to a suspension 

of GO (0.50 mg/mL, 100 mL). The mixture was stirring for several minutes.  



? 3. Synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide and its reduction 

? Page 94 

 

rGO_hydroxylamine. 2 mL of NH2OH (100 mmol dm-3) were added to a suspension 

of GO (0.5 mg/mL, 10 mL). The suspension was in stirring during 30 minutes and the 

brown yellow initial became darker. The pH was adjusted to 12 with NaOH aqueous 

solution (0.1 mol dm-3). After that, the suspension was heated to 80 ºC, during 1 hour.  

All the reduced nanocomposites were washed by centrifugation.

substrates was investigated. After the preparation and characterization of these 

nanocomposites, the influence of the metal nanoparticles in the enhancement of the 

Raman of graphene itself was studied. Different types of supports for the SERS

4.1. Introduction 

Recently, graphene has been shown to have a clear Raman enhancing effect, related 

to its unique flexible and smooth 2D honeycomb structure with a one-atom thickness1-

4. By decorating graphene nanosheets with silver nanoparticles a significantly 

enhanced Raman signal of graphene was found by Xu et al.5 Additionally, 

combination of these two materials can also be used to detect molecules at very low 

concentrations6. Among known strategies for generating graphene-based 

nanomaterials, starting from graphene oxide is the most versatile and easily scalable 

method. Graphene oxide has a single or few layers of carbon structured nanosheets 

strongly oxygenated which are able to nucleate the metal nanoparticles5,7. Silver and 

gold nanoparticles display plasmon excitation in the visible spectrum, are very easy to 

prepare8-10 and their incorporation in several nanocomposites is well-known11-13.  

Combining the characteristics of graphene with those of silver or gold nanoparticles, 

the resultant nanomaterial can act as a SERS substrate. There are several reducing 

agents that have been used to synthesize graphene-based nanocomposites. Hydrazine 

is one of the most common and effective reducing agent for the reduction of graphene 

oxide but due to its toxicity and environmental protection measures, nowadays 

researchers are trying to replace it by eco-friendly reducing agents14. In this work, 

this was one of the concerns for the preparation of the metal nanoparticles-graphene 

oxide (MGO) nanocomposites and the reducing agents chosen were: sodium citrate, 

glucose and eucalyptus extracts. Sodium citrate have been already used in our 

research group to synthesize gold-graphene nanocomposites which have shown SERS 

activity7. Glucose is a well-known reducing agent used in the formation of MGO 

nanocomposites15,16. The extract of eucalyptus was also recently reported by our group 

as a reducing agent17 and used to prepare MGO nanocomposites.  

 

4.2. Results and Discussion 

The nomenclature adopted to identify the MGO nanocomposites prepared with the 

different chemical agents was the following: MGO_sodium citrate, MGO_glucose and 



? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates 

? Page 102 

 

MGO_eucalyptus extract (M = Ag or Au), in some cases it will be used to abbreviate 

MGO_SC, MGO_G and MGO_EE, respectively. In the case of gold nanocomposites 

hydroxylamine was also used as reducing agent18 (AuGO_hydroxylamine or 

AuGO_HDA). The previous nanocomposites were evaluated for its capacity as SERS 

substrates in varied conditions. 

 

4.2.1. Characterization of AgGO and AuGO 

nanocomposites 

The AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites were synthesized according to the experimental 

procedure described in section 4.4. The reducing agents used were sodium citrate, 

glucose and eucalyptus extract (Scheme 4.1); in the case of AuGO hydroxylamine, 

NH2OH, was also used. 

   

   citrate         glucose eucalyptus extract 

Scheme 4.1 – Reducing agents used for the in situ synthesis of MGO nanocomposites. 

 

The presence of oxygen-groups in the surface of GO allows the nucleation of metallic 

nanoparticles7. In the GO surface, due to the large number of oxygen-containing 

functional groups, the distribution of metal nanoparticles can be successfully done 

(Scheme 4.1). This approach is a possibility to obtain platforms that can be used as 

SERS substrates because the electromagnetic sites are well distributed almost 

?ordered?, which is a requirement to obtain a good Raman signal enhancement19. The 

reduction process will affect both the metal ions, originating the metal nanoparticles,

and the graphene oxide that will be converted to reduced graphene oxide (Scheme 

4.2). 

 

Scheme 4.2 – In situ synthesis of silver or gold nanoparticles in the presence of graphene oxide. 

 

 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-vis absorption were used to characterize 

the as-prepared graphene-based nanocomposites (Figure 4.1 and 4.2). UV-vis spectra 

of the metal colloids obtained with the same reducing agents but in the absence of 

GO, and of GO itself were also recorded. Observing the SEM images it is possible to 

see the differences in the nanoparticles size depending on the reducing agent used. 

The reduced graphene oxide present in the metal nanocomposites continues to show 

transparency and the characteristic wrinkles which means that GO keeps its well 

exfoliated structure even after the composites preparation. In Figure 4.1, the silver 

nanoparticles grown in AgGO_sodium citrate and AgGO_eucalyptus extract show a 

very similar size, between 40 and 60 nm. This is confirmed by the UV-vis spectra of 

both nanocomposites and is according to previous results reported17. Using glucose as 

the reducing agent, the silver nanoparticles (AgNP) obtained are bigger than the 

AgNP obtained with the other two methods. The AgGO_glucose nanocomposites show 

AgNP with 100-200 nm of diameter. Such size differences will influence the SERS 

signals obtained using these composites as substrates, as will be shown later in this 

thesis.

In Figure 4.2, the UV-vis results indicate that when sodium citrate was used the gold 

nanoparticles should be quite similar in size to those produced with eucalyptus 

extract. However, in the SEM images, the gold nanoparticles present in the 

AuGO_sodium citrate nanocomposite are larger. The reduction with hydroxylamine 

originates gold nanoparticles with a star shape that cannot be observed in the SEM of 

AuGO_HDA, but is clearly shown in the SEM image of the gold colloid obtained by 

reduction with hydroxylamine (Figure 4.3). The ?max in the UV-vis of  the latter colloid 

is near 600 nm which is in agreement with the literature18.

4.2.2. SERS studies  

4.2.2.1. SERS of graphene in AgGO and AuGO 

nanocomposites 

The typical Raman bands D and G of graphene can be enhanced in the presence of 

metal nanoparticles. As mentioned in the introduction section of this chapter, Xu et 

al.5 have demonstrated that by introducing AgNPs on reduced graphene oxide film 

there was an enhancement in the graphene Raman bands. 



? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates 

 

? Page 107 

 

Here, we have studied the influence of growing metal nanoparticles at a GO surface, 

prepared by reduction with sodium citrate, glucose, eucalyptus extract and 

hydroxylamine, respectively, in the Raman spectra of the composites. For such 

analysis, the Raman laser of 488 nm was used. In Figure 4.4, each reducing agent are 

shown the Raman spectra of the initial GO (without reduction), rGO obtained with 

this agent, and the respective MGO composite. 

The Raman spectrum of GO displayed the characteristic prominent D band around 

1365 cm-1 and G band around 1595 cm-1 20. The Raman spectra of the AgGO 

nanocomposites showed a clear enhancement of the main typical bands of graphene, 

D, G and 2D, independently of the preparation method (Figure 4.4). The enhancement 

of the Raman bands of graphene observed in the composites is due to a SERS effect 

originated by the metal nanoparticles present. 

The ID/IG ratio increases in rGO and AgGO when compared with GO, with the use of 

the three reducing agents (Figure 4.4). According to literature6 this change suggested 

the decrease in the average size of the sp2 domains, but more numerous in numbers 

upon reduction of the exfoliated GO. The exception occurs to AgGO_EE where the 

ID/IG decreases from 0.92 of GO to 0.90, which means that the reduction of oxygen 

groups of GO using eucalyptus extract in the presence of silver is smaller than using 

the other reducing agents. It is also important to refer that, in the three cases studied, 

the ID/IG ratio slightly decreases from the rGO to AgGO nanocomposites, this could be 

probably related with the presence of the AgNPs that disrupt the sp2 domains. 

It is referred that the Raman signals of graphene enhanced by silver nanoparticles, 

mainly arise from the SERS EM effect 4. However, the enhancement of the Raman 

signals of the three AgGO nanocomposites varied significantly, which can be seen by 

the results obtained from ID (AgGO)/ID (GO) and IG (AgGO)/IG (GO) (Figure 4.6).

In the case of AuGO nanocomposites (Figure 4.7), only the nanoparticles of gold 

synthesized with hydroxylamine increase the intensity of D and G bands of the 

graphene matrix.

Likewise the ID/IG increases in reduced GO, also the ID/IG in the presence of gold 

nanoparticles increases with the use of the four reducing agents (Figure 4.8). This 

change suggested the decrease in the average size of the sp2 domains, but more 

numerous upon reduction of the GO6. The reduction of hydroxylamine is noticeable 

with ID/IG of 2.9. 

It is well-known that the Raman signals of graphene can be enhanced by gold 

nanoparticles, which mainly arise from the SERS EM effect. However, in this case, 

the intensification of Raman signals were not noticeable (Figure 4.9). In the case of 

AuGO_glucose, the ratios ID (nanocomposite)/ ID (GO) and IG (nanocomposite)/ IG (GO) 

show a decrease of Raman intensities of D and G bands. All the other composites have 

a slightly enhancement of such bands.

4.2.2.2. SERS substrates with AgGO and AuGO 

nanocomposites 

Although the AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites, with the potential SERS activity, 

were characterized in suspension (as produced), the fabrication of SERS active 

substrates with easy to handle properties at low cost was one objective. One way to 

achieve this purpose is to support these suspensions by spreading in an adequate and 

easily to handle material. To support the nanocomposites suspensions we chose 

materials that were already available in the laboratory (filter paper and glass slides) 

or that were easy to produce (PVA membranes). These supports present different 

roughness which is one of the materials characteristics that can influence the SERS 

activity itself. 

The MGO_sodium citrate and MGO_glucose (M = Ag and Au) were the selected 

nanocomposites and the laser used was the 1064 nm. For this study, thiosalicylic acid 

(SHsal) was the analyte chosen to test the SERS activity. The silver and gold 



? 4. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites as SERS substrates 

 

? Page 113 

 

nanocomposites were tested in suspension or deposited in glass slides, filter paper and 

in PVA membranes (Figures 4.11 to 4.14). 

To test the homogeneity of the substrate the AgGO nanocomposite was chosen, a 

SERS mapping of 25 regions of AgGO_sodium citrate with SHsal 1×10-3 mol dm-3 

deposited on a glass slide was made. This type of mapping was recorded using a laser 

of 488 nm. Observing the spectra in Figure 4.10 it is possible to see the homogeneity 

of the SERS activity in the several points of the substrate area tested.

AgGO_sodium citrate. 

 

In the following Figures 4.11 to 4.14 the spectra on the left correspond to substrates 

reduced with sodium citrate, and the spectra on the right correspond to substrates 

reduced with glucose (as stated on the top). The study includes the SERS substrates 

used as suspension and deposited in the supports chose, namely glass slides, filter 

paper and PVA membranes.

Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12 show a comparative study of the AgGO nanocomposites 

and Ag colloids (obtained under the same reduction conditions), as SERS substrates 

in the detection of SHsal. A clear SERS spectrum of SHsal was obtained in the 

substrates of AgGO_sodium citrate both in suspension and supported in filter paper. 

In the case of AgGO_glucose, the composite originated the SERS bands of SHsal in all 

conditions (suspension and supported in glass slides, filter paper and PVA 

membranes). Ag_glucose deposited in glass slides was the only substrate of silver 

nanoparticles only, without graphene, to originate the SERS of SHsal. The 

experiments with the nanocomposite AgGO_glucose also show the SERS bands of 

graphene, together with the bands of SHsal when the analyte was added. 

AgGO_glucose deposited on glass slides was the support that showed the best 

performance for the detection of SHsal molecules with more intense bands than in the 

other supports. 

Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14 show a comparative study of the AuGO nanocomposites and 

Au colloids (obtained under the same reduction conditions), as SERS substrates in the 

detection of SHsal. A clear SERS spectrum of SHsal was obtained in the substrates of 

AuGO_sodium citrate both in suspension and supported in glass slides and in filter 

paper. In the case of AuGO_glucose, the composite originated the SERS bands of 

SHsal in suspension and supported in PVA membranes. Au_glucose deposited in PVA 

membranes was the only substrate of gold nanoparticles only, without graphene, to 

originate the SERS of SHsal. The experiments with the nanocomposite AuGO_glucose 

also show the SERS bands of graphene, together with the bands of SHsal when the 

analyte was detected. AuGO_glucose deposited on PVA membranes was the support 

that showed the best performance for the detection of SHsal molecules. 

Similar studies with the nanocomposites MGO_eucalyptus extract (M = Ag or Au) and 

AuGO_hydroxylamine, did not show a SERS signal for SHsal.

4.3. Conclusion 

The environmental eco-friendly reducing agents, sodium citrate, glucose and 

eucalyptus extract, can be used to prepare nanocomposites of graphene and silver or 

gold nanoparticles. Glucose was the reducing agent that originated the biggest 

nanoparticles (around 100 nm) in the case of silver. 

Using the laser of 1064 nm and for detection of SHsal ethanolic solution, both AgGO 

and AuGO nanocomposites were active as SERS substrates. The best substrates for 

SERS, with SHsal as analyte, were AgGO_glucose deposited on glass slides and 

AuGO_glucose deposited on PVA membranes; with better performance than the 

correspondent nanometal substrates without graphene.

4.4.1. Preparation of active SERS substrates 

4.4.1.1. AgGO and AuGO nanocomposites 

4.4.1.1.1. Sodium citrate 

The reduction of metallic complexes was made by sodium citrate7. 7.5 mg of GO was 

added to a 5 mg of AgNO3 (HAuCl4) dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water (6x10-4 mol 

dm-3 of AgNO3 and 2.4x10-4 mol dm-3 of HAuCl4). The mixture was with stirring 

during 30 min to promote the interaction of silver (gold) ions with graphene oxide 

surface. After that, the suspension was heated until 80 ºC, after which 3.760 mL of 

sodium citrate (85 mmol dm-3) was added dropwise. The experimental conditions 

were maintained during 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension 

was washed by centrifugation.

4.4.1.1.2. Glucose 

The synthesis of nanocomposites was based on method used by Zhao et al16. 1.2 g of D-

(+)glucose was dissolved into 30 ml of a suspension of GO (1.5 mg/mL) under 

sonication during 5 min. 1 mL of ammonia (25%) was added to 10 mL of AgNO3 (0.050 

mol dm-3, 0.0839 g, v = 10 mL). Both phases were mixed and kept in sonication during 

5 minutes. After 24h, the suspension showed a grey precipitate, confirming the 

formation of AgGO_glucose nanocomposite. The same procedure was made using 10 

mL of 0.050 mol dm-3 HAuCl4 (0.1970 g). 

 

4.4.1.1.3. Eucalyptus extracts 

The synthesis of AgGO_eucalyptus extract was made dissolving 0.0068 g of AgNO3 in 

40 mL (1x10-3 mol dm-3) of GO 0.5 mg/mL17. In the case of AuGO_eucalyptus extract 

0.0157 g of HAuCl4 in 40 mL (1x10-3 mol dm-3) of GO 0.5 mg/mL. The mixture was in 

stirring during 10 minutes and after that the eucalyptus extracts (0.0283 g) were 

added. The stirring was kept for about 5 minutes to ensure the complete dissolution of 

reducing agent. The silver nanoparticles were formed after 24 hours17. 

 

4.4.1.1.4. Hydroxylamine  

An aqueous solution 100 mM (2 mL) of NH2OH was prepared and the pH was 

adjusted to 12.0 – 12.5 with a 0.1M NaOH solution in stirring18. 200 µL of a 10 mM 

solution of HAuCl4 in water and 255 µL of 4mg/mL GO suspension (final 

concentration of GO was 0.51 mg/mL) were, simultaneously, introduced into the vial 

under vigorous stirring. The color of the solution changed to dark blue/black. The 

nanoparticles were purified by centrifugation to remove the NaOH from the 

suspension. The AuNS were stored in water at room temperature.

4.4.1.2. PVA membranes 

14 g of PVA (Mw 89,000 – 98,000; 99% hydrolysed) was dissolved in 100 mL of water 

during 4 hours, at 80 ºC with vigorous stirring. Approximately, 1 g of this solution was 

placed in a glass container and was crosslink by three cycles of freeze-thawing (+20 

ºC, -20 ºC)4 21. After complete this process, the final membranes were dried by 

lyophilisation.  

 

4.4.2. SERS measurements 

The Raman spectra and SERS were recorded using a Bruker RFS100/S FT-Raman 

spectrometer (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm excitation). Micro-Raman experiments were 

performed at room temperature using the 488 nm line of an Ar+ laser with an 

incident power in the 1–8 mW range. The light was focused and collected with an 

Olympus microscope (100_ objective) and a ?super-notchplus? filter from Kaiser was 

used to eliminate elastic light. The scattered light was analyzed with a Jobin Yvon 

HR-460 monochromator coupled to a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD. 

Suspension. 500 µL of each substrate was mixed with 20 µL of thiosalicylic acid 

ethanolic solution 0.1 M. The final suspension was analysed as prepared by placing 

200 µL in NMR tube.  

Glass slices and filter paper. SERS measurement was made by placing 20 µL of 

the suspension previous prepared on a glass slice/filter paper and allowing drying at 

room temperature.  

PVA membranes. The PVA membranes were dipped on 500 µL graphene-

nanocomposites suspensions during 24 hours. After that, they were removed from 

suspensions and let dry at room temperature. Thiosalicylic acid was dropped (10 µL) 

on the top of PVA membranes and 30 minutes after that SERS effect was assessed.

5.1. Introduction 

Different types of SERS substrates have been developed involving either pure or 

supported nanostructured metals, mostly gold and silver. A fundamental limitation of 

these planar metal SERS-active surfaces is that analyte molecules must rely on slow 

diffusion from the bulk solution to the surface to facilitate molecule-metal 

interactions, an essential prerequisite for SERS detection. Thus long detection times 

are required to achieve reasonable sensitivities for planar SERS sensors, which is 

unfavourable for online real-time analysis. At the same time, the effective surface 

area of planar nanoparticle-presenting substrates is limited. A simpler and widely 

employed approach to SERS detection is to directly mix metal colloids with target 

analytes1. The metal nanoparticle aggregates containing many ?hot spots? in solution 

can present a large total surface area, thus facilitating effective interactions with 

analytes and generation of strong Raman scattering emission. In comparison to SERS 

sensing using nanostructured metal films, which are inherently planar detectors, this 

approach allows direct probing of analytes within a defined volume of solution, 

thereby providing higher sensitivity. However, metal colloid aggregates are inherently 

unstable and tend to precipitate from solution, resulting in loss of SERS signals. The 

addition of surfactants or hydrophilic polymers can stabilize the colloids, but these 

reagents are known to interfere with the SERS signals of target analytes2,3. It would 

thus be advantageous to develop a SERS detection element capable of providing high 

sensitivity through the use of volumetric detection together with the excellent 

stability of planar nanostructured surfaces, while simultaneously offering enhanced 

analyte-metal interactions for rapid online detection.  

Interestingly, natural nanofibrillar structures such as bacterial cellulose (BC) with 

silver nanoparticles can act as active SERS substrates4. Bacterial cellulose was used 

as a template to grow Ag nanoparticles. Due to the distinctive three-dimensional (3D) 

nanofibrillar structure of BC, the resulting nanocomposites were made up of 

interconnected nanofilaments with discrete Ag nanoparticles at their surfaces 

originating active SERS substrates. The high interfacial area provided by Ag-BC 

cellulosic matrix for the deposition of Ag nanoparticles where organic ligands can 

adsorb, lead to strong Raman enhancement. The importance of substrate three-

? Page 128 

 

dimensionality for SERS was highlighted by several researchers 3,5,6. In contrast to 

conventional planar SERS detectors, 3D structures combines convective flow and 

short diffusion length scales to significantly reduce the time required for analyte 

molecules to reach the SERS-active surfaces. Furthermore, when compared to 

colloidal solutions, the 3D nanostructures concentrate the metal and present a very 

high surface area, resulting in much greater interaction between analyte molecules 

and SERS-active sites. However, most of the methodologies used to prepare these 

substrates such as sputtering, physical vapour deposition or electron beam 

lithography are extremely difficult to find in conventional laboratories. To further 

facilitate and broaden the SERS application, it is important to explore facile, cost 

effective, scalable, and reproducible approaches for the preparation of nanostructured 

SERS substrates with controlled morphologies and structures of nanoparticle 

aggregations to achieve ultrahigh SERS activities/sensitivities. 

Electrospinning is a remarkably robust and versatile approach to synthesize large-

scale 3D networked nanofibre membranes with extremely high surface area-to-volume 

ratios, uniformity and mechanical resilience which could be used as nanostructure-

frameworks to assemble hierarchical nanostructures for 3D SERS substrates7. The 

nanomaterials-processing technique of electrospinning provides a versatile approach 

for the convenient fabrication of fibres with diameters typically ranging from tens to 

hundreds of nanometers. 

Noble metal nanoparticles embedded electrospun nanofibres have been studied widely 

due to their applications in catalysis, antimicrobial, microelectronics, etc8. The SERS 

application of these types of structures has also raised the interested of several 

researchers9-13. 

The preparation of SERS substrates containing noble metal nanoparticles involves 

two main routes: The noble metal NPs can be embedded in the electrospun nanofibers 

or assembled onto the outer surfaces of the electrospun nanofibres. In the former case, 

the analyte molecules are required to permeate into the nanofibres to access the 

SERS-active noble metal NPs encapsulated inside the polymer nanofibres, which may 

be not applicable to some target analytes. In the second possibility, the assembled 

nanoparticles are more available to directly interact with the analyte.  



? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles

For example, Xiaofei Li et al.11 prepared electrospun PVA nanofibres embedded with 

Au–Ag alloy NPs. The NPs were obtained by co-reduction of AgNO3 and HAuCl4, with 

sodium citrate as a reducing agent in the presence of dilute PVA aqueous solution. 

Then, the substrates of PVA/Au–Ag nanofibers were successfully prepared by 

electrospinning. Different SERS signals of PVA/Au–Ag nanofibre could be observed 

with different analyte molecules (4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA), pyridine, and 

thiophenol) molecules. Interestingly, the electrospun PVA/Au–Ag nanofibre substrate 

showed the better SERS sensitivity in comparison with the drop-cast film. Minhua 

Cao et al12 also prepared PVA nanofibres with high concentration of Au NPs on the 

fibres and high sensitivity in the surface enhanced Raman scattering was obtained. 

The high concentration of Au NPs was prepared in 10 wt% PVA solution by one step 

synthesis. The distance between adjacent Au NPs became closer with the increasing 

the amount of NPs. SERS spectra showed a significant Raman signal enhancement of 

4-MBA molecules, which were absorbed on the surface of PVA/Au nanofibres, even 

under a relatively low concentration (10?6 mol dm-3). The nanofibres also showed the 

better SERS performance in comparison to the cast-films. 

The assembling of SERS-active noble metal NPs onto the outer surfaces of the 

electrospun nanofibres was also tested for several authors. For example, Ag 

nanoparticles were decorated on polyacrylonitrile14 or poly(methyl methacrylate) 

nanofibre frameworks15 via wet-chemistry routes, and Au nanorods were assembled 

on poly(2-vinyl pyridine) nanofibre-frameworks by a drop-cast method16 or 

immobilized onto polycaprolactone nanofibre-frameworks via polyelectrolyte 

decoration. In these cases, the assembled NPs on the outer surface of the electrospun 

nanofibres are the key building blocks to achieve SERS-activity, which facilitate 

analyte molecules to be trapped directly onto the ?hot-spots?. 

From the above, it is clear that when considering the development of highly active 

solid substrates for SERS, the surface geometry, that is the micro- and nano-

topography of the substrates, is an important parameter to consider. In this chapter 

we present the work developed with the aim to obtain efficient and free standing 

SERS substrate materials prepared by electrospinning. Electrospun nanofibrous 

membranes can combine the flexible and portable properties of the polymeric 

membrane mats and the plasmonic activity of noble NPs with and without graphene.

Since poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used to produce membranes with silver 

nanoparticles as SERS substrates (Chapter 2) and this polymer is also widely used to 

produce electrospun fibres, we studied the preparation of such type of fibres with Ag 

NPs and AgGO nanocomposites.  

We also tested the assembling of previously prepared NPs and NPs/GO 

nanocomposites on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) electrospun mantles used as a physical 

support for the suspensions.  

 

5.1. Results and Discussion 

Many parameters can affect the electrospinning process, including (a) the solution 

properties such as polymer molecular weight, viscosity, conductivity, elasticity, and 

surface tension; (b) process parameters such as electric potential, flow rate, distance 

between needle tip and collector, needle inner diameter; and (c) ambient parameters 

like temperature, humidity, and air velocity in the electrospinning chamber. For 

example, the polymer solution for electrospinning should have a concentration high 

enough to maintain polymer entanglement, but not too high to inhibit deformation 

caused by the electric field. Improper distance between needle and collector may 

result in a rough and beaded mat with the porosity also severely decreased. The 

applied voltage can produce ionized solution and generate elongation and splitting, 

which would form a uniform fibre structure at a proper level. Whereas, boosting the 

voltage to an extreme high value would result in an unstable electrospinning. In a 

word, electrospinning parameters are quite essential which deserve serious attention. 

The polymeric structures of the two polymers used to prepare the electrospun 

membranes, PVA and PAN, are represented in Figure 5.1.

b) polyacrylonitrile. 

 

We used three different approaches to prepare the electrospun mats for SERS 

measurements. These different approaches were selected sequentially as a 

consequence of the successive results obtained during the experimental work. 

-In the first case, we prepared PVA suspensions with the addition of Ag colloid (Ag-

PVA) or AgGO suspension (AgGO-PVA). In both cases, glucose was used as the 

reducing agent of silver. These suspensions were directly electrospun after the 

adjustment of the electrospinning parameters; 

-In the second case, we choose PAN because we found that it was easier to process the 

fibres from this polymer than from PVA. First, we prepared simple PAN fibres and 

after, the NPs or the nanocomposites were assembled by dipping the PAN mantle 

inside the suspensions aiming to promote a physical adsorption of the NPs and the 

nanocomposites on the electrospun membrane. The materials produced by this 

method were denoted by NP_sodium citrate_PAN, NP_glucose_PAN, NPGO_sodium 

citrate_PAN and NP_glucose_PAN, according to the reducing agent used; 

-Finally, we treated the as-spun PAN fibres with hydroxylamine (HAD) aiming to 

promote the surface functionalization through amidoxime (-C(NH2)=N-OH) groups, 

following a method described by Lifeng Zhang14. The amidoxime group is a 

coordinating/chelating group with high affinity to metal ions, then allowing the 

nucleation of metal nanoparticles. The introduction of graphene in this system was 

also performed as described in the experimental methodology. The prepared materials 

were denoted by nanocomposites-HDA-PAN.

5.1.1. Ag-PVA electrospun membranes 

The 14% (w/w) PVA mantle produced by electrospinning presented an inhomogeneous 

size distribution of the fibres without beads (Figure 5.2 (left)). In the presence of Ag 

NPs, the fibres presented similar morphology to the ones without Ag NPs but with 

beads formation (Figure 5.2 (right)). From SEM observation, only a few Ag NPs 

prepared by the method described by Zhao et al.17 are visualized. It‘s not 

straightforward to say if these Ag NPs are at the surface, or impregnated in the 

fibres. However, most of the Ag NPs should be inside the fibres, the UV-vis 

spectroscopy indicates its presence by the localized plasmon resonance surface, typical 

for silver at 436 nm (Figure 5.5).

Figure 5.4 – Detection of SHsal in Ag-PVA with SERS technique. SHsal solid (a) was inserted as 

reference. SHsal solution was deposited on the Ag-PVA membranes at (b) 10-1 mol dm-3, (c) 10-2 mol dm-3, 

(d) 10-3 mol dm-3, (e) 10-4 mol dm-3 concentrations.

The SERS activity/sensitivity of Ag-PVA nanofibrous membranes was studied with 

thiosalicylic acid (SHsal) as the probe molecule. In a first approach, the Ag-PVA 

membrane was tested as SERS substrate using SHsal ethanolic solution at a 

concentration of 10-1 mol dm-3. In Figure 5.3 (LEFT) it is possible to observe that when 

the SHsal solution was deposited on Ag-PVA membrane (red line) Raman signals 

from SHsal (at 1583, 1558 and 1032 cm-1) are present. All the other peaks are from 

PVA polymer. Since the Ag-PVA substrate showed no characteristic Raman peaks 

from PVA (grey line), it is possible say that the peaks signed at red curve (except 

1583, 1558 and 1032 cm-1) are the confirmation of SERS effect with respect to PVA. 

However, the peaks attributed to SHsal are not SERS effect but are Raman peaks. To 

confirm this statement, the same quantity of SHsal solutions 10-2 and 10-3 mol dm-3, 

which was used in the Ag-PVA membranes, was deposited on a glass slice and let it 

dry. After dried, the Raman spectra of such solutions were made and are shown in 

Figure 5.3 (RIGHT). The solution of SHsal at concentration of 10-2 mol dm-3 showed 

Raman peaks which means that the peaks attributed to SHsal (10-1 mol dm-3) when 

such solution was deposited on Ag-PVA cannot be described as SERS effect but as 

Raman signals.  

These results showed that Ag-PVA can act as SERS substrate for PVA. However was 

important verify the sensitivity of this material to the analyte solution. In Figure 5.4 

are the Raman spectra of SHsal in several concentrations (10-1 to 10-4 mol dm-3) 

deposited on Ag-PVA. It is possible observe that Ag-PVA has the capability of detect 

SHsal solution at 10-3 mol dm-3 by SERS technique.  

Figure 5.5 shows the ?max of the Ag-PVA with SHsal in several concentrations. The 

change in the local dielectric due to molecule absorption was measured by a shift in 

the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) ?max18. When the SHsal was deposited 

on the Ag-PVA nanofibrous membranes, the ?max shifted depending on the 

concentration of SHsal ethanolic solution. Although more studies are needed to 

accurate the tendency of Ag-PVA ?max shifts according the concentration of Raman 

probe molecule it can be said that the results showed in Figure 5.5 confirm the results 

of SERS spectrum in terms of limit detection of SHsal in Ag-PVA nanofibrous 

membranes.

The capability of sensing SHsal at the 10-3 mol dm-3 concentration and the 

enhancement of PVA Raman peaks made the Ag-PVA nanofibrous membrane a 

substrate active in SERS analysis. 

 

 

5.1.2. AgGO-PVA electrospun membranes 

There is increasing number of studies with focus on exploring the SERS efficiencies of 

composites of metal nanoparticles and graphene given the superior SERS capabilities 

of both metal nanoparticles and graphene based materials. SERS signals arising from 

graphene/metal hybrid structures are also shown to be higher compared to the

individual components19. For instance, SERS signals of probe molecules such as 

rhodamine 6G and methylene blue are shown to be further enhanced several-fold 

when compared against those of pure metal nanoparticles, with detection limits 

reaching nanomolar (nM) levels20.  

To try to enhance the limit detection of the previously prepared Ag-PVA fibre 

mantles, we prepared AgGO suspension using glucose as the  reducing agent based on 

the method described by Zhao et al.17. These AgGO nanocomposites were then 

introduced in the PVA solution before electrospinning. 

Although PVA has good mechanical properties in the dry state, its applications can be 

limited by its hydrophilicity21. During the experimental work we started to face this 

limitation and because of that we decided to introduce the crosslink procedure to 

these fibres. Linear polymer can be joined by other chains at points along their 

lengths to make cross-linked structures for the improvement of mechanical properties 

and anti-water solubility21. PVA hydrogels can be cross-linked through the use of 

bifunctional agents such as glutaraldehyde, by using electron beam or ?-radiation, or 

by a ?freezing-thawing‘ process. The later process avoids toxicity issues; furthermore, 

these physically cross-linked materials also exhibit higher mechanical strength and 

elasticity than PVA gels cross-linked by other methods22. Due to mentioned reasons, 

AgGO-PVA (about 0.06 AgGO/PVA (w/w)) was exposed to freeze-thawing crosslinking 

and the effects of this process in SERS measurements were considered.  

  

Figure 5.6 – SEM images of AgGO-PVA (about 0.06 AgGO/PVA (w/w)) without crosslinking effect (LEFT) 

and after freeze-thawing process (RIGHT). 



? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles

From the SEM observation, the entanglement of the AgGO-PVA nanofibrous 

membranes with and without crosslinking is identical. However, after cross-linking 

the fibres seems to show a small increment in the average size diameter (Figure 5.6, 

Left).  

Although, the presence of AgGO in the PVA mantles is not clear from the SEM 

observation, the Raman spectroscopy shows the presence of GO. The ratio ID/IG has 

the same value for both types of mantles, which was expected since the crosslinking 

process should not change the reduction degree of AgGO present in the PVA fibres 

(Figure 5.7).

Figure 5.8 – SHsal detection by SERS spectra using AgGO-PVA without crosslinking (A) and after with 

crosslinking (B). (a) SHsal solid was inserted as reference. SHsal was tested at (b) 10-1 mol dm-3, (c) 10-2 

mol dm-3, (d) 10-3 mol dm-3, (e) 10-4 mol dm-3, and (f) 10-5 mol dm-3 concentrations. In the case of AgGO-

PVA without crosslinking the concentration of 10-5 mol dm-3 was not tested since 10-4 mol dm-3 SHsal 

solution was not identified with this membrane.  

 

The typical peak of SHsal around 1030 cm-1 was identified by AgGO-PVA without 

crosslinking at concentrations of 10-3 mol dm-3. This limit of detection is the same as 

found with Ag-PVA nanofibrous membranes without GO. However, in this case it is 

possible to identify others SHsal Raman peaks at around 840, 1115 and 1150 cm-1. 

These SHsal peaks were not previously detected in the absence of GO.  

The detection limit of the SHsal at the freeze-thawed AgGO-PVA membranes surface 

increased until 10-4 mol dm-3, which seems to indicate that the crosslinking process 

improved the analyte detection by SERS. Moreover, besides the Raman peak of SHsal 

around 1030 cm-1, other two, at approximately 840 and 1150 cm-1, were identified also 

at the limit concentration detected.  



? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles 

 

? Page 139 

 

The reflectance spectra were made for the same samples tested in SERS experiments 

for AgGO-PVA with and without crosslinking, in the same way as to Ag-PVA samples 

(Figure 5.9). The ?max showed for the AgGO-PVA without crosslinking is at 348 nm 

whereas for the AgGO-PVA with crosslinking is at 359 nm which means that the 

agglomeration of the silver nanoparticles is different. In the case of the Ag-PVA with 

crosslinking shows that the cycles of freeze-thawing can be responsible for silver 

aggregates, since the LSPR ?max of Ag nanoparticles is redshifted. We should also 

remind that in the present case, the Ag NPs are localized at the graphene surface and 

nor freely dispersed in the polymer fibres. 

Contrary to the results obtained to Ag-PVA, the LSPR ?max of Ag nanoparticles 

present in AgGO composites did not show a direct relationship with the SHsal 

concentration deposited on the AgGO-PVA mantles (Figure 5. 10). One possible 

reason for this behaviour is that the presence of graphene sheets can also influence 

the LSPR of the silver nanoparticles.  

From the previous results and with respect to the detection limit of the testing 

molecule used, it seems that the crosslinking process can help to increase the 

potential use of these types of membranes as SERS substrates. A tentative 

explanation for this observation may be related with a rearrangement between the 

fibres, characteristic of the cross-linking procedure, that simultaneously promote the 

re-arrangement of the nano-fillers that may became closer and promote more SERS 

active sites.

5.1.3. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) mantles imbibed on 

colloidal suspensions 

The polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is widely used to form fibres by electrospinning. PAN is 

not soluble in water what can constitute an advantage over PVA if the final 

electrospun mantles are conceived as a substrate to detect analytes in aqueous 

solution.  

According to literature, metal nanoparticles attached to electrospun fibres can adsorb 

analytes directly on their surfaces, leading to larger SERS sensitivity. Such type of 

SERS substrates can be prepared by attaching metal nanoparticles onto electrospun 

fibres via methods such as drop-casting, electroplating, sputter-coating, chemical 

reduction, and electroless plating 16,23-27. These fibrous substrates possess interesting 

properties such as thermal diffusivity, conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and 

SERS sensitivity. For instance, Singameni et al. 16 described a high SERS sensitivity 

obtained from a substrate composed by oriented Au nanorods on electrospun 

nanofibres prepared using the drop-cast method.  

 

5.1.3.1. Non functionalized PAN electrospun mantles 

In this work, PAN 14% (w/w) electrospun mantle was produced according to the 

parameters described in 5.3.2.2 section. The resultant fibre PAN mats present several 

beads randomly dispersed through the fibres, as can be observed in the SEM images 

(Figure 5.11). Although it could be possible to continue optimizing the electrospinning 

parameters in order to minimize the beads presence, this was not considered of 

utmost importance for the present work, since these defects could somehow help the 

support of the NPs and NPsGO nanostructures.

Figure 5.11 – SEM images of electrospun PAN mantle. 

 

These fibre mantles were then used as a sorbent to support silver and gold NPs from 

colloidal suspensions, prepared by reduction using sodium citrate and glucose 

reducing agents. The same procedure was used with suspensions containing AgGO 

and AuGO nanocomposites in suspension prepared also using both reducing agents 

referred before.  

The characterization of these materials by SEM and UV-vis spectroscopy is 

summarized in Figure 5.12.

First of all, from these characterization results (Figure 5.12), it is possible to see that 

the nanomaterials were really entrapped in the PAN electropun network, particularly 

in the case of the NPsGO nanocomposites. This latter statement can be understood 

due to size constrains. 

The SEM images (Figure 5.12) show that the glucose produces metal nanoparticles 

bigger than those produced with sodium citrate. The ?max absorbance of Ag_sodium 

citrate_PAN was not according the SEM images; the ?max absorbance in 430 nm 

indicates bigger nanoparticle than in Ag_glucose_PAN (417 nm). The maximum 

absorbance peak positions of Au_sodium citrate_PAN (544 nm) and Au_glucose_PAN 

(550 nm) are according to SEM images.  

The distribution of silver and gold nanoparticles is uniform at the graphene oxide 

surface and these nanocomposites are really entrapped in the electrospun fibres. The 

metal nanoparticles prepared via glucose show some aggregates on the PAN fibres 

whereas the nanoparticles in Ag_sodium citrate_PAN and Au_sodium citrate_PAN 

are well distributed but difficult to identify by SEM due to their small size.  

All the produced PAN mantles were tested for SERS activity (Figure 5.13). Similarly 

to the previous PVA membranes, SHsal ethanolic solution at10-3 mol dm-3 

concentration was the Raman probe deposited on PAN membranes.  

Although the intensity was very weak, the typical Raman peak of SHsal, around 1030 

cm-1, was present in AgGO_sodium citrate_PAN, AgGO_glucose_PAN and 

AuGO_glucose_PAN. 

In the case of Au_glucose_PAN it was possible to identify four peaks of SHsal: 998, 

1070 and 1563 cm-1 with very weak intensity and at 1027 cm-1 with medium intensity.  

For Ag_glucose_PAN, seven peaks of SHsal were identified, one very strong (1029 cm-

1), three medium (1112, 1155 and 1558 cm-1) and three very weak (838, 1457 and 1579 

cm-1).

The present approach to prepare PAN mantles followed by its immersion on 

suspensions, in general, produces materials that can act as SERS substrates. The 

homogeneity and the good distribution of the nanoparticles and graphene oxide sheets 

at the top of PAN mantles can be exploited to other applications besides SERS, such 

as catalysis28,29.  

 

5.1.3.2. Functionalized PAN electrospun mantles 

Another approach to link the metal NPS to the electrospun PAN fibres was adapted 

from a methodology described by Zhang et al14. These authors prepared flexible and 

active SERS substrates by electroless plating of Ag NPs on the surface of electrospun 

nanofibers via a seed-mediated growth process. First they functionalized PAN 

microfibers using hydroxylamine (HDA), followed by seeding with palladium NPs to 

promote the Ag NPs growth. Here, this methodology was adapted to functionalize the 

electrospun PAN-based membranes before the interaction with Ag NPs and AgGO 

nanocomposites (please see section 6.4.3.2.2). The methodology followed to prepare 

these materials is schematized in Figure 5. 14. 

The surface modification and activation of the fibres produced by electrospinning can 

significantly influence the deposition of Ag NPs on the microfibers. The surface of 

PAN microfibers was modified through amidoxime (-C(NH2)=N-OH) surface 

functionalization. Amidoximation of PAN microfibers resulted in the formation of 

?C(NH2)=N?OH groups on the fibre surfaces, leading to a considerable increase of 

hydrophilicity for the microfibrous membranes14.

Figure 5. 14 – Preparation scheme of four different types of materials produced with PAN functionalized: 

Ag-HDA-PAN, AgGO-HDA-PAN, rGO-Ag-HDA-PAN and Ag-GO-HDA-PAN. 

 

As schematized in Figure 5.14, four different routes to prepare new materials were 

followed. A common initial preparation of the fibres was done: the activation of the 

PAN fibre surfaces with hydroxylamine (HAD). The amidoxime functionalized PAN 

fibres were then i) immersed on AgNPs colloidal suspension overnight (Ag-HAD-

PAN); ii) immersed on AgGO suspension overnight (AgGO-HAD-PAN); iii) on AgNPs 

colloidal suspension overnight dried and after immersed on a GO suspension 

previously reduced with HAD (rGO) for 24 hr, (rGO-Ag-HAD-PAN); iv) immersed in 

GO suspensions with different concentrations during 24 hr, followed by Ag NPs 

attachment as referred in the previous point. 

The presence of Ag NPs in the substrate Ag-HDA-PAN was confirmed by SEM (Figure 

5.15) and also qualitative EDS analysis confirmed the silver presence (not shown). 

The UV-vis absorbance shows a maximum at approximately 370 nm, which is a well-

known peak position that indicates the presence of silver nanoparticles30.

The SEM image of AgGO-HDA-PAN indicates the coating of the functionalized PAN 

fibres with the AgGO sheets, showing a good dispersion through the fibres (Figure 5.15). 

The substrate rGO-Ag-HDA-PAN, clearly show the presence of rGO covering the 

fibres with the Ag NPs on the top (Figure 5.15). In the Ag-GO-HDA-PAN, the presence 

of GO sheets is also clearly observed in SEM image; however it seems that the GO 

sheets were mainly wrapped around the PAN fibres (Figure 5.15).  

All the previous materials prepared were tested with Rodhamine 6G (R6G) for their 

SERS activity. The aqueous solution of Raman probe was drop-cast onto the surface of 

the substrates.

The substrate Ag-HDA-PAN showed a very good SERS spectrum for R6G at 10-3 mol 

dm-3 concentration, being possible to identify the peaks localized at 775, 1183, 1306, 

1360, 1449, 1505, 1597, and 1643 cm-1 (Figure 5.16). Almost the same peaks were 

identified at 10-5 mol dm-3. Surprisingly, at the concentration of R6G 10-6 mol dm-3 any 

peak was observed.  

The absorbance spectra of all these samples were acquired (Figure 5.17). The shift of 

LSPR ?max as function of R6G concentration shows that the shift of ?max starts to 

stabilize between 10-4 and 10-5 mol dm-3. Such result is according to SERS results in 

terms of limit detection of this substrate.

In the case of AgGO-HDA-PAN and Ag-rGO-HDA-PAN (Figure 5.18), the R6G 

molecule was only identified at 10-2 mol dm-3 in both substrates, which means that the 

peaks at 1360 and 1505 cm-1 are Raman intensities because the R6G at this 

concentration, deposited onto a glass slice, show the same peaks. In rGO-Ag-HDA-

PAN with R6G at 10-3 mol dm-3, there was a formation of a plateau between 1350 and 

1500 cm-1 which rises doubt if this effect indicates SERS activity. So the 10-4 mol dm-3 

concentration was tested and confirmed that only reliable R6G peaks occurs at 10-2 

mol dm-3. These results indicate that these two substrates did not act as SERS 

substrates. 

The quantity of GO in AgGO-HAD-PAN was 0.18 mg/mL, which means a proportion 

of 1:1 to Ag:GO. So, for the preparation of Ag-GO-HDA-PAN the quantity of GO 

chosen to be added was 0.18 mg/mL. The SERS spectrum of 10-3 mol dm-3 R6G 

indicates the presence of its most intense peak at 1505 cm-1 (Figure 5.19). However 

the intensity of the peak is very weak and because of that we decided to decrease the 

ratio between Ag:GO. New materials were prepared with 0.09 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL 

of GO repeating the experimental procedure. The SERS spectra of R6G with these 

new materials (Figure 5.20) show that the Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN was the more 

efficient one for R6G detection. The specimen with 0.09 mg/mL of GO shows the peaks 

of R6G localized at 775, 1181, 1308, 1360, 1509 and 1645 cm-1 at 10-3 mol dm-3, and at 

1509 cm-1 at 10-4 mol dm-3, although with very weak intensity.  

The presence of D and G bands at 1290 and 1580 cm-1 was shown in all SERS spectra 

of all the substrates based on PAN fibres. Its intensities can supress the identification 

of the probe molecule; on the other hand, when the SERS peaks show an intensity 

enough to overlap the D and G bands, it is possible say that we are in the presence of 

a good SERS substrate. This is what happens with Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN flexible 

microfibrous substrate.  

The work present here shows significant suggestions to tune a material that can 

combine the EM and CM in order to obtain a substrate that can be selective and 

sensitive to several biomolecules.

5.2. Conclusion 

In the present work the potentialities of several types of materials based on the 

polymeric electrospun fibres for SERS detection were shown. The PVA and PAN were 

the polymers chosen. 

The materials based on PVA, where the synthesis method is based on the inclusion of 

silver nanoparticles and graphene oxide into the fibres, the best results where achieve 

for the membrane with AgGO after the occurrence of the cross-linking process. SHsal 

was detected at 10-4 mol dm-3. For the PVA membranes the cross-linking seems to be 

crucial for the enhancement of the Raman intensities of the probe molecule. This 

could be related with the morphology of the substrates which may interfere with the 

SERS active sites. 

The substrates AgGO_sodium citrate, AgGO_glucose_PAN and AuGO_glucose_PAN 

acts as SERS substrates. In the first one, the presence of graphene oxide potentiates 

the enhancement of Raman peaks, since in the correspondent substrate without 

graphene there was no Raman peak of SHsal. In the other two substrates, the 

Ag_glucose_PAN and Au_glucose_PAN shows better enhancement of Raman 

intensities than the correspondent substrates with GO. So it can be said that with 

glucose as reducing agent, the presence of GO is not favourable to SERS substrate, in 

substrates prepared by drop-casting. 

The PAN activated substrates were tested for SERS experiments tuning the structure 

composition of the substrate. The best enhancement of Raman intensities was 

obtained for Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN substrate, however, the substrate which has only 

silver nanoparticles act as SERS substrates with a sensitivity to 10-5 mol dm-3 of R6G, 

with a very high resolution of SERS peaks. In fact, this is the best result in the set of 

materials produced based on fibres and showed in this work. 

All the results shown here contribute to the discussion of the preparation of flexible 

and manageable substrates to SERS applications.

5.3. Experimental procedure 

5.3.1. Synthesis of colloidal suspensions and 

composites-based on graphene 

Graphene oxide was prepared by Marcano‘s method31. 

GO-based nanocomposites were prepared by two different methods. The first one was 

denoted by ?metal_sodium citrate?. The reduction of metal complexes was made based 

on a previous method described by our work group32. 7.5 mg of GO was added to a 50 

mL of 0.24 mmol dm-3 HAuCl4.3H2O aqueous solution. The mixture was stirred during 

30 min to promote the interaction of gold ions with GO surface. After that, the 

suspension was heated until 80 ºC, after which 1.880 mL of sodium citrate (85 mmol 

dm-3) was added dropwise. The experimental conditions were maintained during 1 

hour. The final product was ?AuGO_sodium citrate?. The same experiment was made 

using silver nitrate (AgGO_sodium citrate). 

In the second method, denoted by ?metal_glucose?, the reducing agent used was 

glucose. The synthesis of nanocomposites was based on method used by Zhao et al17, 

using HAuCl4.3H2O. 1.2 g of D-(+)glucose was dissolved into 30 mL of a suspension of 

GO (1.5 mg/mL) under sonication during 5 min. 1 mL of ammonia (25%) was added to 

10 mL of HAuCl4.3H2O (50 mmol dm-3). Both phases were mixed and kept in 

sonication during 5 minutes. The final product was ?AuGO_glucose?. The same 

experimental procedure was followed to prepare silver and GO nanocomposites 

(?AgGO_glucose?). 

The experimental procedure described were repeated using only the metal complexes, 

without GO (Au_sodium citrate, Ag_sodium citrate, Au_glucose, Ag_glucose). Both 

type of suspensions, with and without GO, were used as prepared.

5.3.2. Preparation of electrospun nanofibrous 

membranes 

5.3.2.1. PVA 

5.3.2.1.1. Ag-PVA and AgGO-PVA 

700 mg of PVA was added to 5 mL of Ag_glucose performing a 14% PVA concentration 

(approximately). The mixture was heated at 80 ºC, during 3 hours with slow stirring. 

The solution was loaded into 5 mL syringe which had a properly tube attached at the 

open end, and such tube had a stainless steel needle at the opposite end. The needle 

was connected to the emitting electrode of high-voltage supply capable of generating 

DC voltages in the range of 0-50 kV. An aluminium foil (64 cm of length and 10 cm of 

width) was used as the collection screen which was connected to the ground electrode 

of the power supply (400 rpm) with the distance between the screen and the needle tip 

of 8 – 10 cm. The electrospinning was carried out at 19 ºC – 22 ºC, and relative 

humidity 22 % - 23%. In order to obtain continuous and homogeneous nanofibres, the 

voltage applied was 23 kV, in a rate of 0.1mL/h. The final mantle was dried in air 

before being detached from the aluminium foil. The same procedure was made using 

AgGO_glucose suspension. 

 

5.3.2.2. PAN 

1.4 g of PAN was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF, with stirring during approximately 18 h. 

The use of electrospinning apparatus was the same as describe in previous section. 

Here, the experimental conditions were the following: 2000 rpm of the collector at 12 

cm of the needle, the voltage applied was 20 kV, in a rate of 1.2 mL/h. The procedure 

was followed at 19 ºC – 22 ºC, and relative humidity 62 % - 50%.

5.3.2.2.1. PAN imbibed on colloidal suspensions 

Squares (7 cm x 7 cm, approximately) of PAN mantle were cut and placed upon a 

filter paper inside a Buckner funnel. 5 mL of each suspension of metal nanoparticles 

(Au_sodium citrate, Ag_sodium citrate, Au_glucose, Ag_glucose) and graphene 

nanocomposites (AuGO_sodium citrate, AgGO_sodium citrate, AuGO_glucose, 

AgGO_glucose) were filtered on PAN squares. As the filter papers showed the 

colouring of the suspensions, all the PAN squares and the correspondent filter papers 

were dried in air.  

 

5.3.2.2.2. Functionalization of PAN membranes 

Ag-HDA-PAN 

Prior to the growth of Ag NPs, as-electrospun PAN fibrous membranes were first 

treated in 1 mol dm-3 NH2OH aqueous solution at 70 °C for 5 min; some ?C?N groups 

on the surface of nanofibres reacted with NH2OH, leading to the formation of 

?C(NH2)=N?OH groups. After the treatment, the obtained amidoxime surface-

functionalized PAN (HDA-PAN) fibrous membranes were thoroughly rinsed in 

distilled water and dried before the growth of Ag NPs. 

The AgNPs colloidal suspension was prepared by Lee and Meisel method. 90 mg of 

AgNO3 was dissolved in 500 mL (0.18 mg/mL) of ultra-pure H2O and brought to 

boiling. A solution of 1% sodium citrate (10 mL) was dropwise added. The solution 

was kept on boiling during 1 hour. The Ag sol was yellow-greenish at the final of 

synthesis. 

Finally, HAD-PAN was immersed in 30 mL of Ag colloidal suspension overnight. The 

Ag-HAD-PAN was washed with distilled water and let dried in air. 

rGO-Ag-HDA-PAN 

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was previous prepared using hydroxylamine as the 

following description: hydroxylamine (final concentration of 100 mmol dm-3) was 

added to 50 mL of 0.5 mg/mL GO with vigorous stirring. The pH of mixture was kept 



? 5. Electrospun fibrous membranes decorated with noble nanoparticles 

 

? Page 157 

 

at 12 and heated in an oil bath at 85 ºC; meanwhile the colour of the mixture changed 

from yellowish brown to homogeneous black indicating the reduction took place. The 

Ag-HAD-PAN was impregnated with rGO (0.18 mg/mL) during ~24h. The fibrous 

membrane was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and dried in air before 

characterization and SERS evaluation.  

Ag-GO-HDA-PAN 

In this case, GO was used as the bridge between HAD-PAN and silver NPs. HAD-

PAN was immersed in GO suspensions with different concentrations, 0.18, 0.09 and 

0.06 mg/mL, during 24 h. After the interaction with Ag colloidal suspension, the 

mantle Ag-GO-HAD-PAN was tested in SERS. The substrates were referred as Ag-

0.18GO-HDA-PAN, Ag-0.09GO-HDA-PAN and Ag-0.06GO-HDA-PAN. 

AgGO-HDA-PAN 

Previously, a suspension composed by GO and Ag NPs was synthesized based on Lee 

and Meisel method. 18 mg of silver nitrate was added to 100 mL of GO 0.18 mg/mL 

suspension. The mixture heated until boiling. After 10 minutes of reflux, 2 mL of 

sodium citrate 20 mg/mL was added dropwise. The boiling was kept during about 60 

min and the suspension changed the yellow brownish colour to black. In this 

synthesis, the characteristic changing colour of Ag colloid was not present due to 

simultaneous reduction of GO. After that, the same functionalization described to Ag-

HAD-PAN was followed but in this case using the AgGO previous described in this 

section and at the final AgGO-HAD-PAN was produced. 

 

5.3.3. SERS experiments 

A piece of PVA and PAN composites was cut (approximately 5 × 10 mm) and 4 µL of 

SHsal in several concentrations were deposited on their surface. In the case of 

functionalized PAN mantles, 4 µL of R6G in different concentrations was deposited on 

the PAN pieces and let dried. Raman spectra were acquired using Bruker RFS100/S 

FT-Raman spectrometer (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm excitation). All the experiments

were acquired with 500 scans but the voltage used was dependent of the material 

used (50 – 300 mW).

covered by gold (VAMWCNT_Au) were used as surface-enhanced Raman scattering 

(SERS) substrates. The detection limit for nucleobases was investigated as well as the 

detection of DNA.

Scheme 6.1 – Nucleobases used as SERS analytes. 

 

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is an analytical tool for chemical and 

biological sensing due its capacity of Raman signal amplification by factors up to 10-

14 orders of magnitude, providing ultra-high sensitivity reaching single-molecule 

detection1. The enhancement factor is due to electromagnetic2 and chemical 

mechanisms3. The latter can be explained when the charge transfer-assisted complex 

formation occurs between the molecule and the surface. The electromagnetic 

mechanism is associated to a local electromagnetic field enhanced by excited surface 

plasmons on a metal surface. In order to increase the selectivity and the limit of 

detection, researchers have improved SERS substrates tuning size and shape of the 

1D metal nanostructures which are, normally, the basis of such platforms. Also the 

deposition of the metal nanoparticles was made in flexible supports (cellulose-paper, 

polymer mats4), in silicon wafers or glass, using several techniques such as 

lithography. Recently, 3D nanostructures (nanowires, nanorods, ordered Au particle 

arrays, nanoporous silicon, nanotube arrays, and cavity nano antenna arrays with 

dense plasmonic nanodots) have been proposed as SERS substrates. 

Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been the subject of extensive research because of their 

excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. The application of CNT in

SERS substrates is a research topic with increasing interest that has been addressed 

in several ways: vertically aligned in a silicon support5-7, used as an endoscope tip8,9 or 

specifically functionalized for use as an intracellular probe10. Vertically aligned multi-

walled carbon nanotube (VAMWCNT) arrays functionalized with gold nanoparticles 

generate hot-spots after the deposition of analyte solution. These hot-spots are the key 

for a better Raman signal magnification.  

In this work, we show the potential of the vertically aligned multi-walled carbon 

nanotubes covered with gold nanoparticles to detect the four nucleobases (adenine, 

cytosine, guanine, and thymine) and the deoxyribonucleic acid molecules. SERS 

results obtained for such molecules are stable during, at least, 24 hours, and the 

enhancement factors are between 103 and 105. 

 

6.2. Results and discussion 

6.2.1. Characterization of VAMWCNT-Au 

The SEM images in Figure 6.1 shows a uniformity of the structures with vertical 

aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes covered by gold (VAMWCNT_Au). 

The Raman characteristic bands of VAMWCNT_Au and their relative intensity in two 

different points of the material indicates its homogeneity. The ID/IG ratio in both 

locations was about 1.3. (Figure 6.2).

SERS results are dependent on composition, size, and interparticle spacing of 

plasmonic nanoparticles11 which, are the active components of SERS substrates. In 

this study the substrates were formed by VAMWCNT and gold nanoparticles, it was 

important to verify what was the concentration of AuNP that produced the best SERS 

results. For this study we chosen thiosalicylic acid (SHsal, 0.1M) which is a well-

known SERS probe. 4?L of an ethanolic solution of SHsal was deposited on the 

surface of VAMWCNT_Au substrates with different gold deposition time (5, 15 and 30 

minutes). All the spectra were acquired at the same conditions: 350 mW and 50 scans. 

The most intense peak of SHsal solution (~1030 cm-1) appears in all substrates but the 

spectrum which shows more SHsal bands and more intense was correspondent to 

VAMWCNT with 30 min of gold deposition (Figure 6.3). So, this type of substrate was 

the one used in the SERS studies of nucleic acids and DNA molecule.

The same deposition time of gold nanoparticles was made into a Si surface in order to 

compare, not only SERS substrates efficiency but also the thickness of gold 

nanolayers. The nanoparticles of gold were deposited during 30 min on Si and have 

about 5 nm of diameter (Figure 6.4). This calculation was made using the Image J 

software. The 30 min of gold deposition produced a layer of gold with 86 nm (Figure 

6.5). This statistic value was also calculated by using Image J.

After the application of nucleic acid solutions on VAMWCNT_Au, the top view of the 

substrates was changed from a flat-like surface to small gold islands (SEM images in 

Figure 6.6). This feature changes was the key-point to the enhancement of Raman 

intensity observed that will be observed with these substrates in all tested analytes.

This phenomenon was in agreement with the results obtained in the studies of Boisen 

et al on silicon nanopillars covered by silver12 or gold13.  

 

6.2.2. SERS studies  

VAMWCNT_Au substrates were tested with the four nucleobases and DNA solutions 

(Figure 6.7). Adenine was detected in a concentration of 10-5 mol dm-3 as lower limit. 

Also cytosine has shown some peaks at the same concentration. Guanine and thymine 

were detected at 10-4M. All the spectra acquired for all bases of DNA were repeated 

24h after the first acquisition and all have shown good reproducibility. For such 

reason, SERS results did not show dependence on interaction time between analyte 

and plasmonic surface with this type of substrates. For comparison, all the 

experiments were performed using gold substrates on Si (Figure 6.8). The adenine and 

cytosine were detected at the concentration of 10-5 moldm-3 whereas guanine and 

thymine was detected only at concentrations of 10-4 mol dm-3. This means that for all 

tested species, the limit of detection obtained was the same as with VAMWCNT_Au. 

But the identification of the analyte was more complete with the substrates that 

contain carbon nanotubes; the number of characteristic bands is smaller in the case of 

using Au_substrates. Moreover, the better quality of the spectra acquired from carbon 

structures covered with gold is evident. In this work, no spectrum was submitted into 

a mathematical treatment in order to improve the signal/noise ratio. The same 

procedure was made in the experiments where gold deposited on Si substrates was 

used. The signal/noise ratio was very low in the latter case being some analyte bands 

confused with noise. In fact, only the bands at 737, 795 and 666 cm-1 for adenine, 

cytosine and guanine, respectively, are well defined. All the other bands that were 

identified are poorly defined.

The contribution of each band of each analyte can be observed in Figure 6. 9. The 

SERS spectra of the 10-3 moldm-3 of each analyte were deconvoluted in order to 

analyse the contribution in terms of the analyte bands and CNT bands. With the 

exception of cytosine, in all SERS spectra the CNT bands (D and G) have the major 

contribution in terms of absolute intensity of the signal. The deconvolution was made 

by fitting the peaks with the Lorentz function using Origin 9.0 software. 

VAMWCNT_Au substrates provided a vibrational analysis very complete for the 

molecules studied. The proposal of the assignment bands are in the Table 6.1. to Table 

6. 4. The deconcolution made by Origin software was not able to show the contribution 

of all the peaks for thymine. The peaks localized at 1649 and 1394 cm-1 of thymine 

were assigned as ?very weak? which means that its intensity were very weak and, 

probably, this was the reason why identification was not possible by deconvolution.

Double-stranded DNA was also used as Raman reporter in VAMWCNT_Au substrates 

(Figure 6.10).  The signal/noise ratio showed by such spectrum was also good as with 

the other tested molecules. Once again, in the case of gold substrates the presence of 

noise affected the analysis of SERS signals. Table 6.5 shows the vibrations 

corresponding to the SERS bands obtained for DNA with the substrates studied in 

this work.

In the same way as in chapter 6 of this thesis, the shift of localized surface plasmon 

resonance (LSPR) of gold nanoparticles interacting with the analyte was evaluated. 

Figure 6.11 shows UV-vis spectra, in reflectance mode, of VAMWCNT after the 

deposition of 4 µL of each nucleobases solution with all tested concentrations. The 



?6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates

LSPR of gold nanoparticles showed a position displacement depending on the tested 

concentration. Cytosine, guanine and thymine have caused a major red-shift at the 

lowest concentration detected by SERS measurements, i.e., 10-5 moldm-3 in the case of 

cytosine, and 10-4 moldm-3 for the other two nucleic acids. Adenine showed a different 

trend, the SPR showed a red-shift with the concentration solutions decreasing (Figure 

6.11 and Table 6.6). In fact, by the graphics showed in Figure 6.12, where the LSPR 

positions are represented as function of the nucleobase concentration, it is possible to 

see that LSPR positions of VAMWCNT with adenine and cytosine becomes to start 

stabilizing at 10-5 moldm-3 and with thymine at 10-4 moldm-3. These results are in 

agreement with the detection limit found with SERS results.

6.2.3. SERS Enhancement Factor calculation 

The magnitude of SERS enhancement can be estimated calculating the enhancement 

factor (EF). Although this parameter is maintained only as a comparative factor, it is 

an important tool to assess the efficiency of the substrates. We have estimated the EF 

considering that the analyte molecules were adsorbed on the gold surface of 

VAMWCNT-Au substrates, in an estimated depth of 290 µm, as measured from the 

SERS images. 

The EF can be calculated using the following equation21: 

                                                  
          ?

       ?
                                               (1)    

Where ISERS and IRS are SERS and Raman signals intensities, NSurf is the number of 

analyte molecules adsorbed in the scattering volume of SERS spectra and Nvol is the 

average number of molecules present at the scattering volume of Raman spectra.  

An analyte aqueous solution 0.067 M was used to measure the Raman intensity for 

EF calculations. The scattering volume is the volume of analyte excited by the laser. 

Considering a laser spot diameter of 350 µm and the 5mm thickness of the glass tube 

used for the aqueous sample, the scattering volume for Raman was 4.81X10-7 dm3, 

and Nvol is 3.22X10-8 mol.  

NSurf is calculated by             , where µSERS is the density of the analyte in SERS 

substrate and VSERS is the scattering volume of SERS. When the drop of aqueous 

analyte solution (4X10-6 dm3, 1x10-3 M) was deposited on the substrate, the drop 

spread through it creating a volume in a cylinder shape with a diameter of 4 mm and 

290 µm height. VSERS was calculated using the laser spot diameter (350 µm) and the 

estimated value of its depth inside the substrate (37.150 µm). So, NSurf was 3.92X10-12 

and the final equation was

? 6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates

The EF was also calculated for flat gold-Si substrates. In this case, its height was 

estimated at 86 nm.  The diameter of the spreading solution analyte at its surface was 

considered the same as in the VAMWCNT-Au substrates (4mm), and EF equation was

Figure 6.13 – Comparison of the EF calculated for the several bands characteristic of adenine, cytosine, 

guanine and thymine present in SERS spectra obtained using VAMWCNT-Au and Si-Au substrates to 

detect 4 ?L of adenine 10-3 mol dm-3. 

 

The enhancement factor was calculated for all the bands identified which had 

correspondence to the Raman spectra of the concentrated aqueous solutions of the 

analytes (Figure 6.13). The carbon nanostructures based-substrates provided EF 

between 1x104 and 8x105 for the four nucleic acid molecules. In the case of Au_Si 

substrates the EF maximum obtained was 10 which confirms the efficiency of the 

VAMWCNT_Au. 



?6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates 

 

? Page 184 

 

The explanation of such EF provide from the leaning effect of the VAMWCNT_Au 

substrate12. When a droplet of an aqueous solution was deposited onto the substrate, 

and letting evaporate, surface tension caused the vertical aligned carbon nanotubes to 

lean towards their nearest neighbours, thus creating self-assembled hot spots. 

Analyte molecules adsorbed at the tips of the carbon nanotube were, then, located 

exactly in the hot spots as the nanotubes leaned together. This self-assembling 

mechanism creates a large number of electromagnetic hot spots inside the laser 

excitation area, as was shown in other published works using carbon nanotubes22 or 

silicon nanopillars12,13.  

 

6.3. Conclusions 

New substrates of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes covered by gold 

nanoparticles (VAMWCNT_Au) were prepared in order to evaluate its development in 

SERS detection. 

VAMWCNT_Au showed good performance in the detection of adenine and cytosine 

with concentrations as low as 10-5 moldm-3. Guanine and thymine were detected using 

the same type of SERS substrates with lowest concentrations of 10-4 moldm-3. Also the 

DNA molecule was detected. 

The well-defined Raman peaks of nucleic acids, enhanced by the presence of 

VAMWCNT_Au, is a novelty in biomolecules detected by SERS. This good definition 

allows the estimation of the analyte peaks and substrate peaks contribution.  

 

 

6.4. Experimental Procedure 

6.4.1. Preparation of VAMWCNT_Au and Au substrates 

CNT forest growth was carried out in a hot-wall thermal CVD reactor using a C2H2 

(purityP 99.6%, 300 ppm of H2O, Praxair)–H2 (purityP99,999%, 62 ppm of H2O, 



? 6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates 

 

? Page 185 

 

Praxair)–Ar (purity P99,9999%, 60.5 ppm of H2O, Praxair) gas mixture at 

atmospheric pressure. The reactor consists of a 5 cm inner diameter quartz tube 

housed inside a furnace, equipped with mass flows, electrovalves and a PC control 

station for automatic operation. 

In a typical growth run, the substrates were placed in a quartz boat and loaded into 

the cold zone of the reactor, with the furnace already heated at the temperature of 

set-point. The reactor tube was then pumped down to 3 Pa and subsequently filled up 

with Ar to reach the atmospheric pressure. Afterwards, the quartz boat was pushed to 

the centre of the hot zone using a stainless steel arm, allowing a fast heating. Then, a 

two stepped annealing process was initialised. Firstly, in an inert flow of Ar (1000 

sccm), followed by a treatment in a reductive flow of Ar/H2 (v/v) = 0.4 (700 sccm). 

Subsequently, the Ar and H2 flows were adjusted and the C2H2 was added for the 

CNTs synthesis. After the growth step, the C2H2 and H2 flows were cut off and the 

quartz tube was flushed with Ar flow to remove the reactive gases. Finally, the quartz 

boat was pulled to the cold zone for a fast cooling down to room temperature in 

around 2min. The furnace and the empty quartz boat were then purged with O2 in 

the hot zone during 10 min to burn out the carbon residuals, becoming the system, 

after that, ready for a new growth run23. 

The gold nanoparticles were deposited on the top of VAMWCNT and Si, using the 

sputtering equipment, under vacuum, for 30 min. The final substrates obtained were 

VAMWCNT_Au and Si_Au. 

 

6.4.2. SERS measurements 

The nucleobases solutions were prepared immediately before SERS experiments. 4 ?L 

of each analyte solution were deposited on the top of SERS substrates and dried 

during 30 minutes before the spectrum acquisition. After 24h, all the spectra were 

again acquired in order to check if the interaction time between the analyte and 

substrate has some influence on the sensibility of substrate.   



?6. Gold covered vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays as highly sensitive SERS substrates

All the spectra were acquired with 500 scans, using a FT-Raman Bruker RFS -100/s 

spectrometer, 1064 nm laser with power 350 mW.

In this chapter a reflection is made about the experimental work realized and 

the results obtained. Considerations are made about the positive results 

obtained together with some weaknesses that were also identified, towards the 

future preparation of easily manageable active SERS substrates for the 

detection of biomolecules.

The study was set out to explore the preparation of active SERS nanocomposites 

comprising metal nanoparticles associated to carbon nanostructures. The study was 

also directed to support these nanocomposites on a physical support (membrane or 

film) easy to handle, inexpensive and reproducible. The reason to explore the 

preparation of these nanocomposites and study their SERS activity is to contribute for 

the development of new substrates for the specific detection of biomolecules. 

In a first step, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composites were prepared incorporating silver 

nanoparticles initially without introduction of carbon nanostructures.  Several 

experimental parameters were considered to obtain the best SERS analysis. The dried 

samples at 105 ºC showed the best SERS results. These membranes were stable for 

long periods of time (more than 4 months) and showed the ability to identify nucleic 

acids by SERS.  

Next, the synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide (GO) was implemented to 

be used in the preparation of silver and gold nanocomposites. Well exfoliated GO 

nano-sheets (single or few layers) were produced at the laboratory. The reduction of 

this nanomaterial with different chemical agents was explored, since its reduction 

degree may be a determinant factor for the application envisaged (biomolecules 

interaction). The chemical reducing agents were selected based on a low toxicity 

criteria and were glucose, sodium citrate, eucalyptus globulus extracts and 

hydroxylamine. These reducing agents showed different efficiency to restore the sp2 

carbon network of graphene. Also, not all the oxygen functional groups were 

completely removed using these chemicals, under the experimental conditions used. 

Additionally, from the characterization results it was possible to conclude that some 

molecules from the reducing agent were adsorbed at the final rGO material (even 

after washing procedure) what could interfere with the SERS activity determination. 

The preparation of the graphene nanocomposites with silver and gold was performed 

with the different reducing agents previously referred. The SERS activity of these 

new nanocomposites was then explored in the presence of thiosalicylic acid, varying 

the experimental conditions for Raman spectra acquisition. It was interesting to

verify that both the silver and the gold containing nanocomposites presented the 

particularity to intensify the graphene D and G bands. 

Fibrous membranes were also prepared by electrospinning with the aim to prepare 

SERS supports with different topography and porosity able to promote the creation of 

particular nanoparticles distribution for the establishment of the so-called hot-spots. 

The polymers polyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylonitrile were selected for electrospinning. 

Using this technique, electrospun mantles with silver and gold nanoparticles and the 

corresponding graphene nanocomposites were prepared. Several variables were 

studied, such as the introduction of the nano-fillers during the electrospinning 

process, posterior deposition of the nano-fillers on the simple electrospun polymeric 

fibres and surface functionalization of the simple polymeric membranes to later link 

the nano-fillers. The results obtained showed that this is a promising methodology to 

prepare SERS active substrates, although much more optimization work is needed, 

there is still plenty of room for improvements of this methodology. 

At last, the potentialities of using carbon nanotubes forests, produced by chemical 

vapour deposition and coated with gold film by sputtering, as new SERS substrates 

were explored. It was found that these nanostructures were suitable for SERS 

detection of DNA bases and DNA itself, representing an interesting route to be 

optimized and explored in future work. It is important to highlight the good definition 

of the Raman spectra achieved with this type of substrates for these biomolecules. 

Summarizing, in this work a great variety of materials was prepared. Several 

substrates confirmed a good potential for SERS detection of the analytes tested. 

However, as was verified in this thesis, there are a huge number of variables that 

may interfere with the outcome of a good SERS activity and consequently the 

detection of vestigial concentration of the probe molecules. For example, the probe 

molecules used in this study may not be the most adequate for the specific substrates 

prepared in this work, there are a plenty of other possible analytes to evaluate. 

Future work could include, for example, the selection of a restricted number of the 

most promising substrates and the study of this selection with different type of 

analytes.

Using metal-graphene nanocomposites as SERS substrates instead of the metal alone 

was shown to give better results in some specific conditions, but there is a plethora of 

variables involved. Further efforts should be devoted to the design and synthesis of 

noble metal-graphene nanocomposites to further improved SERS performance. It 

remains a grand challenge for creating a general substrate that can detect diverse 

target analytes. Taking advantages of the high affinity of graphene oxide toward 

aromatic molecules and the SERS property of nanostructured metals, these 

composites exhibit great potential for diverse aromatic molecules sensing. 

Future work must include, after a systematic study of the previously referred 

parameters, the surface modification of the most promising substrates to fine-tune 

their SERS activity and make them specific to identify certain biomolecules. In this 

way, a contribution to the development of manageable SERS sensors for the selective 

detection of biomolecules in targeted research could be achieved.

CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES: 

 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a FEG-SEM Hitachi 

S4100 microscope operating at 25 kV.  

The optical spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-560 UV-vis spectrophotometer; the 

samples were recorded in the absorbance and reflectance mode.  

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Hitachi H-9000 

operating at 300 kV. The samples for TEM were prepared by depositing an aliquot of 

the graphene suspension onto a carbon-coated copper grid and then letting the solvent 

evaporate.  

The FTIR spectra of different samples of graphene were recorded from KBr pellets 

(Aldrich, 99%, FT-IR grade) with a Mattson 7000 FT-IR spectrometer with resolution 

8 and 256 interferograms. 

A Digital Instruments MultiMode scanning probe microscope (SPM) with a Nanoscope 

IIIA controller in tapping mode was used for the AFM measurements. 

For thermogravimetric measurements a TGA - Shimadzu, TGA-50, was used with a 

nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min and a temperature rate of 5 ºC/min, between 20 and 

800 ºC. 

The Raman spectra and SERS were recorded using a Bruker RFS100/S FT-Raman 

spectrometer (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm excitation).  

Micro-Raman experiments were performed at room temperature using the 488 nm 

line of an Ar+ laser with an incident power in the 1–8 mW range. The light was 

focused and collected with an Olympus microscope (100X objective) and a ?super-

notchplus? filter from Kaiser was used to eliminate elastic light. The scattered light 

was analyzed with a Jobin Yvon HR-460 monochromator coupled to a liquid nitrogen 

cooled CCD.
