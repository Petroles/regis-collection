ABSTRACT  

The uptake of natural living resources for human consumption has triggered serious changes in the 

balance of ecosystems. In the archipelagos of Macaronesia (NE Atlantic), limpets have been 

extensively exploited probably since islands were first colonized. This has led to profound 

consequences in the dynamics of rocky shore communities. The specific objectives of this thesis were 

to: 1) develop and characterize species-specific microsatellite markers for the limpets Patella candei 

(d’Orbigny 1840) and Patella aspera (Röding 1798), endemic to the Macaronesia archipelagos; 2) 

assess their genetic diversity, population structure and contemporary levels of connectivity throughout 

Macaronesia; 3) conduct a morphometric analysis of the P. candei complex to complement molecular 

data; 4) evaluate the temporal and spatial variation in recruitment of P. candei and study its 

association with real-time environmental data; 5) assess the effect of temperature on larval 

development of P. candei; and 6) provide general recommendations to foster the sustainable 

exploitation of limpets in Macaronesia. A total of twelve and seventeen microsatellite markers were 

described for P. candei and P. aspera, respectively. These showed clean polymorphisms and species-

specific markers were combined in three optimized multiplex reactions. For P. candei, a highly 

significant genetic break between archipelagos following isolation by distance was detected. 

Contrastingly, significant genetic differentiation among islands (i.e. Azores) was absent possibly 

indicating ongoing gene flow via larval exchange between populations. Significant shell shape 

differences among archipelagos were also detected using both distance-based and geometric 

morphometric analyses. Adaptive processes associated with niche differentiation and strong barriers 

to gene flow among archipelagos may be the mechanisms underlying P. candei diversification in 

Macaronesia. As for P. aspera, genetic analyses showed significant population structure between 

populations from Azores and populations from Madeira and Canaries, and absence of current or 

historic gene flow between these. Results also suggest that both population clusters have experienced 

demographic changes over time. Heterozygote deficits were common across populations, which can 

be better accounted for by inbreeding than by null alleles or Wahlund effect. Such levels of inbreeding 

are likely a consequence of a significant reduction of reproductive units due to decades of intense 

exploitation. The monitoring program applied to track P. candei recruitment showed that early recruits 

occurred throughout the entire duration of the program, but its intensity varied in space and time. In 

general, a marked peak in recruitment occurred during winter/spring months, the period of greatest 

reproductive activity, when sea surface temperatures are lower and wave turbulence higher. 

Significant wave height was probably the most important proximate cue triggering the recruitment of P. 

candei, which eventually depends on adequate ultimate drivers for spawning and reproduction (i.e. 

temperature). Indeed, as a winter-breeder, P. candei larvae seem to perform better and attain higher 

fitness at colder temperatures. In fact, experimental treatments on larval rearing showed that larval 

development was faster at increasing temperatures but cumulative survivorship decreased; about 25% 

of larvae at higher temperatures survived to the end of the experiment, a 2-fold decrease from the 

average survivorship of ~ 50% at lower temperatures. Overall, the outcomes of this thesis fill a gap in 

our knowledge about processes involved in determining the connectivity patterns between limpet 

populations and the environmental factors influencing such patterns across the Macaronesia region.

The present study is an important first step in this direction of using multi-faceted approaches to 

understand complex processes operating at the marine environment, while providing a fundamental 

asset to define stocks and thus inform specific conservation strategies that foster the sustainable 

exploitation of limpets throughout Macaronesia archipelagos.

RESUMO  

A exploração de recursos naturais biológicos para o consumo humano tem provocado alterações 

graves no equilíbrio dos ecossistemas. Nos arquipélagos da Macaronésia (NE Atlântico), as lapas 

têm sido extensivamente exploradas, provavelmente desde que as ilhas foram colonizadas. Isso 

levou a profundas consequências na dinâmica das comunidades litorais. Os objetivos específicos 

desta tese foram: 1) desenvolver e caracterizar marcadores de microssatélites específicos para as 

espécies de lapas Patella candei (d’Orbigny 1840) e Patella aspera (Röding 1798); 2) avaliar a sua 

diversidade genética, estrutura populacional e conectividade na Macaronésia; 3) realizar uma análise 

morfométrica do complexo de espécies P. candei para complementar os dados moleculares; 4) 

avaliar a variação temporal e espacial no recrutamento de P. candei e estudar sua associação com 

dados ambientais; 5) avaliar o efeito da temperatura no desenvolvimento larvar de P. candei; e 6) 

fornecer recomendações gerais para promover a exploração sustentável de lapas na Macaronésia. 

Um total de doze e dezassete marcadores de microssatélites foram caracterizados para P. candei e 

P. aspera, respetivamente, e amplificados em reações multiplex devidamente otimizadas. Para P. 

candei, foi detetada uma diferenciação genética significativa entre os arquipélagos. Ao invés, não se 

verificou diferenciação entre ilhas (isto é, Açores), o que constitui provavelmente um sinal da 

existência de fluxo migratório de indivíduos (larvas) entre populações. Foram também detetadas 

diferenças significativas na forma da concha entre os arquipélagos. Processos adaptativos 

associados à variabilidade de nichos e fortes barreiras ao fluxo genético entre os arquipélagos podem 

constituir os mecanismos subjacentes à diversificação de P. candei na Macaronésia. Quanto a P. 

aspera, as análises genéticas mostraram uma diferenciação populacional entre populações dos 

Açores e as populações da Madeira e Canárias. Os resultados também sugerem que ambos os 

grupos populacionais sofreram mudanças demográficas ao longo do tempo. Os défices 

heterozigóticos revelaram-se comuns em todas as populações, provavelmente uma consequência de 

processos endogâmicos associados a uma redução significativa dos indivíduos reprodutores, devido 

a décadas de exploração intensa. O programa de monitorização do recrutamento de P. candei 

permitiu verificar que surgem novos recrutas durante todo o ano, embora a sua abundância varie no 

espaço e no tempo. Em geral, um pico acentuado ocorre durante os meses de inverno/ primavera, 

coincidente com o período de maior atividade reprodutora, no qual as temperaturas da superfície da 

água do mar são baixas e é maior a agitação marítima. A par da temperatura (sobretudo pelo seu 

papel na atividade reprodutora), a altura significativa das ondas é provavelmente o fator mais 

importante a desencadear o recrutamento de P. candei. Por outro lado, os dados de desenvolvimento 

larvar revelaram que o desenvolvimento é mais acelerado a temperaturas superiores, mas a 

sobrevivência acumulada diminuiu; cerca de 25% das larvas expostas a temperaturas mais elevadas 

sobreviveram até ao final da experiência, sendo que cerca de metade das larvas sobreviveu a 

temperaturas inferiores. Em geral, os resultados desta tese preenchem uma lacuna no conhecimento 

sobre os processos envolvidos na determinação dos padrões de conectividade entre populações de 

lapas e os fatores ambientais que influenciam esses padrões na região da Macaronésia. O presente 

estudo constitui um importante primeiro passo no uso de abordagens multidisciplinares para 

compreender processos complexos que operam no meio marinho, proporcionando uma ferramenta

CHAPTER 1 

General introduction 

 

Introduction 

There is growing consensus that anthropogenic activities are impacting the structure and functioning 

of marine ecosystems. For instance, over-fishing is known to have profound community-level effects 

particularly when keystone species are targeted (Durán and Castilla 1989; McClanahan et al. 1996; 

Orensanz et al. 1998; Jackson et al. 2001; Ainley and Blight 2009; Smith et al. 2011). This is 

especially relevant in oceanic archipelagos such as Macaronesia, which present unique habitats with 

fragile communities that are highly susceptible to degradation and ecosystem disruption (Hawkins et 

al. 2000). Potential factors contributing to such fragility include the generally low and stochastic nature 

of benthic recruitment in a dispersive island environment (Siegel et al. 2008) and the often frequent 

and pervasive nature of human resource exploitation. 

For the last decades, perhaps centuries, rocky shore limpets have been heavily exploited throughout 

Macaronesia, and contemporary stocks are facing a continuous risk of overexploitation (Santos et al. 

1990, 1995; Morton et al. 1998; Hawkins et al. 2000; Martins et al. 2008). One of the greatest 

challenges in fisheries research is the adequate delimitation and identification of such stocks (e.g. 

Hawkins et al. 2016). Failure by fishery managers to account for stock complexity and composition 

may lead to the depletion of particular components, with unknown ecological consequences 

(Stephenson 1999). Stock delimitation should be able to integrate data from multiple sources, and use 

genetic as well as physical, biological and ecological information to identify the demographic 

processes involved in the population dynamics of a given exploited species. Genetic approaches can 

give insights into the broad definition and extent of genomic admixture among management units, 

which are important in conservation efforts especially in overexploited species at risk of extinction. 

These molecular tools can expand our ability to understand population demography, dynamics and 

structure, while uncovering putative adaptive genetic differentiation among populations and/or species. 

Population genomics can thus provide vital information for fisheries management and species 

conservation, as it can potentially revolutionize the delineation of conservation units, as well as our 

understanding of the adaptive response of populations to rapid environmental changes and the 

evolutionary consequences of selective harvesting (Nielsen et al. 2009; Funk et al. 2012). On its own, 

however, genetic approaches may be insufficient to quantify true levels of demographic connectivity 

and the ecological effects of movement among populations of a given species (Turner et al. 2002; 

Chapuis et al. 2011; Hawkins et al. 2016). Information on life history traits, such as reproduction, 

development, growth, transport and fate of planktonic larvae, settlement and recruitment, provides 

additional insights into larval dispersal and ecological population connectivity, and hence, a more 

accurate understanding of population dynamics.

This thesis addresses the population genetics and dynamics of two exploited species of limpets in 

Macaronesia in general and the Azores in particular. The overall aim is to delimit stock units to enable 

management and conservation of these economically and culturally important species. In addition to 

population genomic approaches using next generation sequencing, basic biological and ecological 

information essential to understand connectivity and population dynamics has been collected. Below, I 

briefly review the literature on marine dispersal and connectivity, recruitment in benthic invertebrates, 

the use of molecular genetic tools to understand connectivity, and Macaronesian limpets, before 

outlining the overall aims and rationale of the thesis. 

 

Dispersal, isolation and connectivity in marine organisms 

Many sessile marine organisms have a life-history cycle which includes a pelagic larval stage with 

high potential for dispersal (Cowen et al. 2000; Morgan 2001). This has driven researchers to accept 

that marine populations can be regarded as open, meaning that their offspring are freely spreading 

and mixing over large geographical areas (Cowen et al. 2000). However, this traditional view has often 

been challenged by a number of studies who have reported far more restricted dispersal than 

previously predicted, suggesting that a large proportion of larvae may be retained and do not take 

advantage of their full putative potential for dispersal (Jones et al. 1999; Cowen et al. 2000; Mora and 

Sale 2002; Swearer et al. 2002; Warner and Cowen 2002; Levin 2006; Cowen et al. 2006; Wood and 

Gardner 2007; Gaines et al. 2007; Jenkins et al. 2007). Evidence of limited dispersal have been 

provided by i) the use of novel molecular, genetic and geochemical techniques (Almany et al. 2007; 

Becker et al. 2007; Teske et al. 2011); ii) the recognition of the significance of many biological traits, 

such as larval behaviour and open-water mortality (Burton and Feldman 1982; Fisher 2005; Sanford et 

al. 2006); and iii) a better understanding of physical processes that restrict larval movement, such as 

oceanographic dominant currents, eddies and upwelling systems (Thornhill et al. 2008; Galarza et al. 

2009). In fact, the connectivity and structuring of marine populations result from several biological (life 

history traits, larval behaviour), ecological (food availability, species interactions), and physical (past 

and present oceanographic and climatic features) processes (see Grantham et al. 2003). The interplay 

of these factors, acting across a range of spatial and temporal scales, has significant implications in 

determining the amount of gene flow and connectivity between usually patchily distributed marine 

populations (Palumbi 1994; Cowen and Sponaugle 2009 and references therein). Occasionally, 

populations may become isolated if factors negatively affecting dispersal are substantial in time and 

space, with migration or dispersal becoming fully restricted. Under such scenario, isolated populations 

slowly differentiate and adapt to the point of reproductive isolation and new different species may be 

generated (Allendorf and Luikart 2007). 

On top of all factors affecting dispersion, geographic distance between areas of suitable habitat can by 

itself promote population isolation such that no or only limited contact is possible between them (Avise 

2001). This is particularly important on oceanic islands, which provide a good example of isolation by 

distance leading to speciation. Oceanic islands, by definition, have never been connected to any 

landmass. All the species present on those islands colonized them via exceptional events of long 



	 5 

distance dispersal, and then diverged from their mainland source populations, sometimes into new 

endemic species. Additionally, evidence suggests that self-recruitment increases with isolation and 

that isolated islands will on average receive lowers levels of recruitment, owing to dispersive larval 

loss, than equivalent mainland sites (Cowen et al. 2000); this is notable even on islands close to 

mainland (e.g. Crisp and Southward 1958; Hawkins and Hiscock 1983). 

Given the intrinsic difficulties of tracking marine particles in their natural environment, processes 

affecting larval dispersal and, hence, population connectivity, are still poorly understood (Swearer et 

al. 2002; Weersing and Toonen 2009). In fact, complex interactions between coastal geomorphology, 

ocean currents and species life-history traits result in variable and complicated temporal and spatial 

patterns of larval dispersion and settlement (e.g. Lagos et al. 2008). For example, there is now 

mounting evidence that connectivity and gene exchange between populations can be fairly low, even 

in species that can freely disperse their offspring. For instance, gene flow was shown to be restricted 

for species with (Semibalanus balanoides), but also without (Nucella lapillus) planktonic larval stages 

(Bell 2008). A meta-analysis study by Weersing and Toonen (2009) revealed that the capacity to 

disperse (provided by the pelagic larval duration) does not predict the magnitude of gene flow and 

geographic scale of population structure in marine systems. This suggests that, in many cases, larval 

exchange is restricted despite the inherent potential to disperse (Hedgecock 1986). Low levels of 

larval exchange may thus limit the success of any protected area and may prevent multiple 

conservation objectives from being achieved (Cowen et al. 2006). Understanding the scale at which 

populations are connected is therefore a fundamental aspect to consider in biodiversity conservation, 

stock delimitation, fishery management, and the spatial design of marine protected areas. Indeed, 

many theoretical studies suggest that population connectivity plays a fundamental role in local and 

metapopulation dynamics, community dynamics and structure, genetic diversity, and the resiliency of 

populations to human exploitation (for overviews see Hansson 1991; Hastings and Harrison 1994; 

Botsford et al. 2009). 

 

Recruitment in benthic marine macroinvertebrates 

Recruitment variability remains one of the most striking features of the dynamics of many marine fish 

(e.g. Hjort 1914; Lasker 1981; Cushing 1990) and invertebrate populations (e.g. Bowman and Lewis 

1977; Hawkins and Hartnoll 1982; Gaines et al. 1985; Caffey 1985; Roughgarden et al. 1988; 

Underwood and Fairweather 1989) and it is often a direct consequence of the life history strategy of 

many marine species (Fogarty et al. 1991). Recruitment, defined as the addition of new individuals to 

a population, is indeed a major aspect of population dynamics and it is intrinsically related to concepts 

such as dispersal and population connectivity (Cowen et al. 2006). At the marine realm it 

encompasses a range of stages and processes that are affected by a suite of biotic and abiotic 

factors, often operating at very different temporal and spatial scales (Caley et al. 1996). Although 

environmental variability is the dominant source of short-term fluctuations in recruitment, the longer-

term dynamics are regulated by the interaction between environmental stochasticity and modes of 

population regulation (Fogarty et al. 1991). 



	 6 

Most marine invertebrates are relatively sessile or sedentary as adults but have an obligate pelagic 

larval stage that is dispersed by ocean currents while it develops competency to settle (Marshall and 

Morgan 2011). From the moment adult individuals reproduce, until juveniles are added to the 

population, early life stages (and even gametes if fertilization is external) are subject to the interactive 

role of many physical, chemical and biological factors that can potentially affect the growth and 

survival of these free-living units. These include i) variation in the reproductive output of adult 

populations which determines the abundance and quality of propagules in the water column (Uriz et al. 

1998; Treml et al. 2012); ii) trophic interactions such as competition, predation, the presence of 

suitable prey, diseases, parasitism which can all act to determine the fate of early life-stages in a 

highly dynamic environment (Keough and Downes 1982; Murphy et al. 2014; Gagliano et al. 2007; 

Spounagle et al. 2011); iii) variable offshore and nearshore oceanographic processes with distinct 

physical attributes that can either limit or enhance the movement, development and onshore transport 

of planktonic larvae (Hawkins and Hartnoll 1982; Pineda et al. 2007; Morgan et al. 2009; Baltazar-

Soares et al. 2014); iv) planktonic larval behaviour and choices made by larvae at the time of 

settlement (Crisp 1955; Jenkins 2005; Murphy et al. 2014); and v) availability of suitable sites to settle 

and recruit (Gaines and Bertness 1992). Indeed, recruits may vary in their settlement/post-settlement 

fitness depending on their source, genetic composition and/or experiences during the larval stage (e.g. 

Schmidt and Rand 2001). 

Recruitment exhibits therefore a highly variable pattern, being determined by a set of interacting 

processes working upon the development, transport, settlement and post-settlement of early-life 

stages of marine invertebrates. Understanding the factors that affect the dispersal of propagules, their 

mortality rates, the recruitment output, the degree of connectivity between local populations, the 

phylogeographic structure and the impacts of local extinction, either natural or anthropogenic-derived, 

on the resilience of marine populations holds particular importance in biological conservation. This 

challenging task is essential for an ecosystemic approach to the management of marine environment, 

not only for addressing short-term management issues but also to predict the potential effects of 

global change on species and systems. 

 

Molecular and genetic tools in connectivity studies 

Genetic studies can make an important contribution for the understanding of population dynamics by 

allowing us to test hypothesis about larval dispersal, population connectivity, genetic diversity, and 

population equilibrium. Comprehensive reviews of different genetic marker types have been previously 

reported (Avise 1994; Sunnucks 2000; Schlötterer 2004), as were the advantages of microsatellites 

over other DNA markers (Schlötterer 2000; Selkoe and Toonen 2006). Microsatellites or simple 

sequence repeats are tandemly repeated motifs of 1 - 6 bases found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic 

genomes analysed to date. High degree of length polymorphism and the relative ease of scoring the 

alleles represent two major features that make microsatellites of exceptional interest in genetic studies 

(Zane et al. 2002). Their high variability makes them very powerful genetic markers and they have 

proven to be an extremely useful tool for a range of applications including ecological and evolutionary 



	 7 

studies, genomic mapping, pedigree analysis and investigations of the genetic structure of populations 

(for review see Jarne and Lagoda 1996). The use of genetic information has also become a popular 

tool in conservation studies (Wolf et al. 2000; Salgueiro et al. 2008), with only a few focusing on 

commercially important or exploited species (e.g. Knutsen et al. 2003). Overall, fast-evolving markers 

such as microsatellites can increase our understanding of the population genetic structure in marine 

organisms and of the role of their reproductive strategies. It can also highlight some concepts such as 

population connectivity, gene flow, recruitment, larval dispersal, or contemporary demographic history 

of populations and thus providing important information for conservation and management strategies 

(Weersing and Toonen 2009). 

To date, few studies have focused on the genetic structure of patellid limpets from the Macaronesia 

archipelagos (e.g. Côrte-Real et al. 1996; Weber and Hawkins 2005, 2006; Sá-Pinto et al. 2005, 

2008). These focused mostly on phylogeny and/or inter-specific relationships among limpets, and in 

most cases, the use of allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and/or nuclear genes, did not show the 

necessary resolution to address questions about structuring processes, especially at intra-species 

levels. Even so, despite relatively conflicting results about the phylogenetic relationships within the 

genus Patella in the Macaronesia, all studies agree and point out for clear limitations in gene flow 

between the Macaronesian islands and the adjacent continental platforms. As previously mentioned, 

although microsatellites are increasingly recognized as an efficient and high-resolution genetic tool, 

and have been used in patellids limpets before (see Ribeiro et al. 2010), no study has yet used them 

to examine the genetic structure of patellid limpets throughout Macaronesia. 

 

Limpets from the Macaronesia (NE Atlantic) 

Located in the Northeast Atlantic, the Macaronesia region consists of five archipelagos: Azores, 

Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries and Cape Verde (Fig. 1). The region is defined as a biogeographic 

entity based on the similarities found among archipelagos in terms of fauna and flora. All islands are of 

volcanic origin and have distinct but fairly recent geological age (see Ávila et al. 2016). Patellid limpets 

inhabiting these archipelagos are considered a valuable resource and have been intensively exploited 

presumably since islands were first colonized (Santos et al. 1995; Côrte-Real et al. 1996; Hawkins et 

al. 2000; Navarro et al. 2005). 

Given that active grazing by limpets is a key process in shaping the structure and functioning of rocky 

shore communities (Underwood 1980; Branch 1981; Hawkins and Hartnoll 1983; Dungan 1986; 

Menge 2000; Boaventura et al. 2002; Jenkins et al. 2005; Jonsson et al. 2006; Davies et al. 2007; for 

meta analysis of marine herbivory impacts see Poore et al. 2012), the over-exploitation of limpet 

populations can have a large impact on the ecosystem. For instance, Martins et al. (2008) have shown 

that exploitation of limpets in Azores has pushed the intertidal community to an alternate state where 

turf-forming algae have displaced barnacles as the dominant space occupier resulting in shifting the 

structure and functioning of this ecosystem. In fact, under reduced numbers of limpets, algal 

sporelings and germlings can opportunistically grow to a size that allows them to escape grazing and 



	 8 

thus form mature algal patches that are able to persist through time altering the community dynamics 

and energy flow (Hawkins et al. 1992; Coleman et al. 2006). 

 

Figure 1. Location of Macaronesia archipelagos: Azores, Madeira, Canaries and Cape Verde. 

In the Azores, limpets represented an important economic resource up to the 1980’s, when they were 

the 6th most profitable regional fishery (Martins et al. 1987a). In 1988 the limpet fishery in São Miguel, 

Azores, collapsed, and after a one-year ban throughout the archipelago, the stocks were allowed to 

recover, avoiding catastrophic over-exploitation effects (Hawkins et al. 2000). In 1993, legislation was 

passed to protect limpet populations. Limpet no-take areas were created and seasonal harvesting 

restrictions were applied in addition to minimum legal catch sizes (Decreto Regulamentar Regional nº 

14/93/A). A relatively recent survey of limpet populations in Azores has, however, detected clear signs 

of over-exploitation with populations virtually extinct in some islands (Martins et al. 2008). 

Patellid limpets are broadcast spawners and go through a planktonic larval stage in their life cycle. 

Adult animals are benthic and the larva is the only phase during their life-cycle which has the ability to 

disperse over large spatial scales. In dispersive isolated oceanic islands such as Macaronesia islands, 

it is not clear whether the different island populations form a single metapopulation (a common larval 

pool to each archipelago) or, in contrast, populations on each island are isolated from other 

populations. This, however, has important implications for the management and conservation of 

exploited stocks. 

Two well-known limpet species occur simultaneously across the archipelagos of Azores, Madeira 

(including Selvagens) and Canaries; these are Patella candei (d’Orbigny 1840) and Patella aspera 

(Röding 1798) (Fig. 2). The former is usually found at mid and high shore and also subtidally, 

especially on boulders (Hawkins et al. 2000); the later occurs in the low intertidal and to 10 m depths 



	 9 

(Hawkins et al. 1990a); its distribution is not usually continuous, but interrupted by an algal turf in the 

lower eulittoral to shallow sublittoral (Hawkins et al. 1990b). In addition, P. piperata occurs in the 

Canaries and Madeira, but not the Azores (Christiaens 1973).

In the past decades, the taxonomy of the P. candei species complex across Macaronesia has 

received a fair amount of attention (see Christiaens 1973; Côrte-Real et al. 1996; Weber and Hawkins 

2002; Sá-Pinto et al. 2005). For instance, a comprehensive taxonomic review of the genus Patella has 

assigned a particular sub-species to a specific archipelago, i.e. P. candei gomesii found throughout 

the Azores, P. candei ordinaria in Madeira, P. candei crenata in the Canaries, and P. candei candei in 

the Selvagens Islands and Fuerteventura island (for revision see Christiaens 1973). Subsequent work 

using allozymes showed that P. candei from the Azores differed from P. candei in Madeira and 

Canaries (Côrte-Real et al. 1996). Allozyme electrophoresis was also used to study populations of P. 

candei from the Macaronesian archipelagos (Weber and Hawkins 2002) and two distinct genetic 

groups were found, one comprising P. candei gomesii and P. candei candei and the other combining 

P. candei crenata and P. candei ordinaria. A suggestion was made that these two groups should be 

considered as two subspecies of P. candei, based on intermediate phenotypes found in the Canaries 

and Selvagens. More recent work done by Sá-Pinto et al. (2005) did not fully support previous 

findings. In their study, and using modern mtDNA techniques, two well-differentiated groups were 

always identified in the Macaronesian islands: one including P. candei from the Azores, Desertas and 

Madeira, and another one grouping P. candei from the Canaries and Selvagens together with Patella 

lugubris from Cape Verde. Given such confliting results, there is still some uncertainty as to whether 

P. candei from the different archipelagos should be given a specific status or not. 

Without much taxonomic debate, and formerly known as P. ulyssiponensis (which is now the name 

given for continental specimens), the designation of P. aspera arose from the detection of genetic 

differences between individuals from Macaronesia islands and those from continental Europe (Weber 

and Hawkins 2005). Whilst P. candei is a typical gonochoristic species, P. aspera is a protandric 

sequential hermaphrodite species with external fertilization, where individuals start off as males but 

may undergo a sex change with age (Martins et al. 1987b). Hence exploitation tends to focus on the 

larger females in the population as larger limpets (predominantly females) are selectively removed 

(Martins et al. 2017). Despite conservation legislation in the region, P. aspera limpets are under 

severe pressure and few individuals survive long enough to become females, a phenomenon that 

severely restricts the effective population size (Allendorf et al. 2008), although some compensation is 

apparent due to density dependent processes (Martins et al. 2017; see also Borges et al. 2016 and 

Fenberg and Roy 2012 for work on the protandrous limpets Patella vulgata and Lottia gigantea, 

respectively). 

 

Aims, thesis outline and structure 

This thesis is focused on limpets because they are an important resource, but also ecologically 

important species that require prioritizing conservation strategies. There is a clear need for work on 

limpets in the Macaronesia, prompted by the fact that these species are highly exploited commercially 

and their stocks in most islands have been declining steadily with profound negative effects on coastal 

communities. One of the main goals of this thesis is to evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of 

limpet populations, and hence, connectivity throughout the region, expecting that results can help 



	 11 

identify stocks and conservation units with potential benefits for management plans targeting the 

preservation of limpets across the region. 

Overall, the following key questions related to limpet population dynamics in Macaronesia are 

addressed: are populations inhabiting different islands connected; if so, to what extent; and what is the 

spatial scale of gene flow, and when does it become restricted? Are there areas of higher genetic 

diversity that require prioritizing and special protection? What is the impact of human exploitation on 

the genetic diversity and structure of limpets? What factors contribute to the recruitment and realised 

dispersal of limpets throughout the region? Are limpet populations sufficiently resilient to withstand 

fishing pressure, given their isolation on oceanic islands? What recommendations can be made to 

promote better sustainable practices in limpet harvesting? 

The thesis will focus only on the limpet species occurring in the Azores archipelago, where the core of 

experimental work was performed: Patella candei and P. aspera. 

Starting with the development and characterization of high-resolution, species-specific microsatellite 

markers [Chapter 2 (Faria et al. 2016) and Chapter 3 (Faria et al. 2015)], this thesis reports patterns of 

genetic diversity and structure for both P. candei and P. aspera throughout the Macaronesia region 

[Chapter 4 (Faria et al. 2017a) and Chapter 5 (Faria et al. 2017b), respectively]. Given that the 

addition of new individuals to populations is a direct consequence of the realised dispersal capacity of 

a species, the spatial and temporal recruitment patterns of limpets and their relationship with 

environmental variables will then be described and discussed (Chapter 6). Given that P. aspera is 

known to recruit mostly below low tides, and ocean conditions in the Azores are rather severe during 

wintertime preventing adequate sampling, monitoring of recruitment was only possible for P. candei, 

which is mostly distributed at mid-shore levels, providing a relatively easier way to access sampling 

sites. This research was complemented with a temperature-controlled larval rearing experiment, since 

it is known that temperature is the main factor affecting the development and duration of larval stages 

in open water, and therefore influences the capacity of larvae to disperse (Chapter 7). A final general 

discussion integrating the results of all chapters is provided in Chapter 8. This final chapter includes 

also implications to the studied species conservation and management, and suggestions for future 

research. The structure and original content of the published papers (Chapters 2 – 5) were maintained 

and only scientific style and format of references, figures and tables were changed to provide 

consistency and standardization to the dissertation as a whole. 

Overall, the genetic data, alongside with biological, ecological and oceanographic information, 

produced, gathered and/or discussed in this thesis, are expected to make an important contribution for 

the understanding of population dynamics of limpets in Macaronesia by allowing testing hypothesis 

about larval dispersal patterns, recruitment and life history traits, population connectivity, genetic 

diversity, and resilience of limpet populations to human exploitation. Due to its multidisciplinary 

approach, this PhD thesis will provide information of theoretical as well as practical importance that 

may be used to inform conservation strategies and promote the sustainable exploitation of limpets in 

Macaronesia.

CHAPTER 2 

A multiplex microsatellite tool for conservation genetics of the endemic limpet 

Patella candei in the Macaronesian archipelagos 

 

 

ABSTRACT  

1. The intertidal limpet Patella candei represents an important exploited resource in the Macaronesian 

archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries (NE Atlantic). Despite being considered endemic, the 

taxonomic status of P. candei throughout the region remains unclear.  

2. The aim of this study was to develop novel microsatellite markers using next generation sequencing 

for the limpet P. candei.  

3. Twelve novel loci were described and amplified in 103 individuals from two populations (Azores and 

Madeira) using three multiplex reactions. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 14 and 

global observed heterozygosity was 0.417. Genetic differentiation between samples was highly 

significant (FST = 0.427) as two main gene pools (K = 2) were identified using Bayesian approaches.  

4. The present genetic tool can be useful to establish the genetic structuring and patterns of 

connectivity of P. candei in Macaronesia as well as to determine the number of extant subspecies 

within the P. candei species complex. Such data will provide a fundamental asset to define stocks and 

thus inform specific conservation strategies that foster the sustainable exploitation of the P. candei 

complex throughout Macaronesia archipelagos.

Introduction  

The Macaronesian (NE Atlantic) archipelagos comprise the oceanic islands of Azores, Madeira, 

Canaries and Cape Verde and are separated from the Euro-African mainland by between 100 km and 

1 900 km. Several patellid limpet species can be found on these islands and are viewed as key 

species for the structuring and functioning of rocky shore communities, since they graze on algae and 

control their abundance (Coleman et al. 2006; Martins et al. 2010). Limpets have long been collected 

for human consumption but the stocks in several islands have been over-exploited and face severe 

collapse. Limpet overfishing has also resulted in ecological changes to the intertidal community 

structure with important ecosystem-level impacts (Martins et al. 2008; Martins et al. 2010). The limpet 

species Patella candei (d’Orbigny 1840) inhabits rocky shores from mid-intertidal to 5 m depth in all 

Macaronesian archipelagos except Cape Verde (Côrte-Real et al. 1996) and like P. aspera, is highly 

exploited for human consumption (Hawkins et al. 2000; Faria et al. 2015). Patella candei, as a 

Macaronesian endemic limpet, is threatened nowadays by over-exploitation and habitat disruption. 

The taxonomy of the P. candei species complex has prompted considerable scientific debate in recent 

decades (Côrte-Real et al. 1996; Weber and Hawkins, 2002; Sá-Pinto et al. 2005). For instance, a 

comprehensive taxonomic review of the genus Patella has assigned a particular subspecies to a 

specific archipelago, i.e. P. candei gomesii found throughout the Azores, P. candei ordinaria in 

Madeira, P. candei crenata in the Canary Islands, and P. candei candei in the Selvagens Islands and 

Fuerteventura island (for revision see Christiaens 1973). Later work using allozymes showed that P. 

candei from the Azores differed from P. candei in Madeira and Canary Islands (Côrte-Real et al. 

1996). Weber and Hawkins (2002) also used allozyme electrophoresis to study populations of P. 

candei from the Macaronesian archipelagos and found two distinct genetic groups, one comprising P. 

candei gomesii and P. candei candei and the other comprising P. candei crenata and P. candei 

ordinaria. The authors further suggest that these two groups should be considered as two subspecies 

of P. candei, based on intermediate phenotypes found in the Canary Islands and Selvagens. 

Additional work done by Sá-Pinto et al. (2005) using more modern mtDNA techniques did not fully 

support previous findings. In their study, two well-differentiated groups were always identified in the 

Macaronesian islands: one including P. candei from the Azores, Desertas and Madeira, and another 

one grouping P. candei from the Canaries and Selvagens together with Patella lugubris from Cape 

Verde. The taxonomic status of Macaronesian limpets thus remains unclear with much controversy as 

to whether P. candei from the different archipelagos should be given a specific status. Despite its 

opportunistic life history (gonochoristic species with external fertilization, a pelagic larval stage, a 

relatively continuous pattern of recruitment, and a fast growth rate) populations of P. candei candei are 

now virtually extinct in all but one of the Canary Islands (Núñez et al. 2003; Navarro et al. 2005) and 

therefore listed in the Catalogue of Endangered Species of the Canary Islands as well as in the 

Spanish National Catalogue of Endangered Species. Similarly, P. candei abundance has dramatically 

decreased over the last decades in the Azores (Martins et al. 2011) and there is evidence of 

recruitment failure on its smaller islands (Martins et al. 2008).  



	 25 

The aim of this study was to develop and test a novel multiplex microsatellite tool from the P. candei 

genome that can be used to establish the genetic structure of populations and their biogeographic 

distribution patterns across the Macaronesian archipelagos. Such a novel molecular tool can provide a 

fundamental asset to define stocks and thus inform conservation strategies that foster the sustainable 

exploitation of P. candei throughout Macaronesia. 

 

Methods 

A total of 103 individuals of P. candei were collected from Terceira (Azores, n = 53) and Madeira 

(Madeira, n = 50) that lie around 1150 km apart from each other (Fig. 1). Genomic DNA was isolated 

from muscle tissue using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA extraction kit. The quality and quantity of DNA 

extractions were assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). A DNA mix from 

five individuals (&gt; 10 ?g mL-1) from Azores was used to develop microsatellite-enriched libraries with 

the new generation pyrosequencing GS-FLX titanium technology (454 Life Sciences, Roche) and 

reagents (Malausa et al. 2011 for details) as implemented by Genoscreen (France). In essence, small 

digested fragments from genomic DNA were PCR amplified and enriched for microsatellite content by 

using magnetic streptavidin beads and labelled TG, TC, AAC, AAG, AGG, ACG, ACAT and ACTC 

repeat oligonucleotide probes. Subsequent enrichments were PCR amplified, and the sequences 

obtained were analysed using the bioinformatic QDD pipeline (Meglécz et al. 2010). Sequences 

containing microsatellite motifs were identified and several primer pairs were tested for each marker 

until satisfactory PCR amplifications were achieved.

Sixty-five primer pairs were selected for initial amplification testing in a subset of P. candei samples, 

following standard PCR protocol (QIAGEN). Polymorphic markers that amplified reliably were 5? end-

labelled in the forward primer using 6-FAM, VIC, NED or PET fluorophores (Applied Biosystems). In 

addition, a five-bp pig-tail sequence (GTTT) was added to the 5? region of each reverse primer, to 

facilitate adenylation (Brownstein et al. 1996). Markers were then tested for multiplex compatibility. 

The number of markers included in each multiplex PCR was as high as possible, accounting for their 

allele size range, assigned dye label, and the avoidance of potential hairpin structures and primer 

dimers as indicated in AUTODIMER (Vallone and Butler 2004). MULTIPLEX MANAGER v.1.0 

(Holleley and Geerts 2009) was used to combine all markers into the most efficient number of PCR 

reactions. After testing for suitable amplification of the selected multiplex, each setup was applied to 

genotype all P. candei samples. Multiplex PCR was carried out in 10 ?L reactions containing ~30 ng 

DNA template, 1 × QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit, 0.5 – 1.2 ?mol L-1 of each primer and ddH2O. 

Parameters for thermal cycling were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min, eight touchdown cycles (reduction of 

0.5 °C per cycle) at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature (TA + 2 °C; Table 1) for 60 s, and 72°C for 

40 s; 25 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, TA for 60 s, and 72°C for 40 s; 10 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 45 

s, and 72°C for 45 s. A final elongation was performed at 60 °C for 30 min. Genotyping was performed 

on an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) automated DNA sequencer using an internal size standard 

(GeneScanTM 500Liz®, Applied Biosystems) for accurate sizing and GENEMAPPERTM v.4.2 (Applied 

Biosystems) was used for allele calling.

Standard genetic diversity estimates (observed and expected heterozygosities – HO and HE) and tests 

for linkage disequilibrium and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were calculated using GENEPOP 

v.4.2 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). The presence of null alleles was assessed at a 95% confidence 

interval using MICRO-CHECKER v.2.2.3 (van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Null allele frequencies were 

estimated for each locus and population with FREENA (Chapuis and Estoup 2007). Genetic 

differentiation between samples (FST) was calculated using with ARLEQUIN v.3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and 

Lischer 2010) following Weir and Cockerham (1984) and FREENA, which uses Weir (1996) 

calculations and the so-called ENA correction method for the positive bias on FST induced by the 

presence of null alleles (Chapuis and Estoup 2007). Population structure was assessed using the 

Bayesian model-based clustering approach implemented in STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 

2000) and individuals were assigned to a given cluster without using any prior information about their 

origin. Correlated allele frequencies and the admixture model were assumed. Ten independent runs 

were made for K = 1 – 2 with each run consisting of a burn-in of 105 Markov-chain Monte Carlo steps, 

followed by 5 × 105 iteration steps. Selection of the most likely number of genetic clusters (K) was 

based on Evanno et al. (2005) ?K method. For comparison purposes, genetic differentiation between 

samples was estimated either on all the loci set, or on a subset of loci after removing those bearing 

putative null alleles. Reassignment of significance levels for multiple tests comparison was performed 

using the sequential Bonferroni correction (Rice 1989).  

 

Results 

The GS-FLX sequencing platform produced 30 683 individual sequences, of which 1 799 contained 

microsatellite motifs. Primer pairs were designed for 107 potential markers, where 88% of them were 

dinucleotides, 10% trinucleotides and 2% tetranucleotides. Several primer pairs out of the 65 selected 

for initial amplifications were discarded either because they showed tri-allelic patterns, exhibited 

artifact bands interfering with allele calling, and/or were monomorphic for all samples screened. 

Twelve primer pairs that showed clean polymorphisms were combined in three optimized multiplex 

reactions and assayed in all samples (Table 1).  

Preliminary analyses showed that populations are well differentiated and therefore genetic diversity 

indices were calculated for each population separately. All loci amplified in the Azorean sample. In 

contrast, five loci failed to amplify in individuals from Madeira (Table 2). Loci CAN9, CAN26 and 

CAN33 did not amplify at all and two additional loci failed to amplify in more than 30% of the Madeira 

sample size. Since microsatellite markers were developed from Azorean P. candei individuals, the 

amplification failure of five loci in Madeira sample, suggests that the genetic differentiation between 

samples is very significant.  

The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 14 in Terceira (Azores) and showed average 

observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosity of 0.359 and 0.436, respectively (Table 2). The 

number of alleles in the Madeira sample ranged from 2 to 12, and observed (HO) and expected (HE) 

heterozygosity were 0.289 and 0.479, respectively (Table 2).

Azores and Madeira. 

 

There was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci and three loci in Terceira and four 

loci in Madeira deviated significantly from HWE (Table 2). Probable causes for such deficit are non-

random mating, population subdivision (Wahlund effect) or the presence of null alleles (Allendorf and 

Luikart 2007). It is noteworthy that all loci causing departures from HWE showed a high putative 

frequency of null alleles as indicated by MICRO-CHECKER and FREENA (Table 2). Again, null alleles 

were more often found in the genotypic distributions of Madeira, suggesting high amplification 

mispriming due to its genetic divergence from the Azorean sample.  

Genetic differentiation between samples was very high and significant (FST_ARLEQUIN = 0.427, P &amp;lt;

0.001). FST estimates obtained by excluding null alleles were slightly lower (FST_FREENA corrected for 

null alleles = 0.336; 95% CI (0.139 – 0.486) than the ones obtained when null alleles were ignored 

(FST_FREENA = 0.359; 95% CI (0.159 – 0.515)). In this case, the occurrence of null alleles seems to have 

little impact on estimates of population differentiation. Strong subpopulation structure was also 

detected using Bayesian inferences, with the number K = 2 being chosen by the ad hoc statistic ?K as 

the most probable number of gene pools present in the sample system, a result that agrees with the 

high FST divergence level observed between samples. Similar results were obtained when restricting 

the differentiation analysis to the loci set that did not exhibit null alleles (data not shown).  

 

Discussion  

Present results performed with a new genetic tool on two P. candei samples from Macaronesia 

provide evidence of a large demographic uncoupling among geographically distant limpet populations. 

Such a phylogeographic break is likely due to limited larval connectivity among archipelagos since 

adult patellid limpets are broadcast benthic spawners and the planktonic larval stage susceptible to 



	 29 

passive dispersal is believed to range from a few days up to 27 days (Ribeiro 2008; Nakano and 

Sasaki 2011). While many other factors can be involved (Cowen and Sponaugle 2009 for review), the 

putative limited dispersal ability of patellids, and the relationship between their life-history 

characteristics and ocean circulation processes probably contributed to the genetic differentiation 

observed between archipelagos. In the context of fisheries management, population discrimination 

from seemingly uniform stocks is paramount to correctly designate discrete management units for 

conservation. Any conservation strategy aimed at the sustainable exploitation of P. candei throughout 

Macaronesia should be archipelago-specific, and consider aspects such as local population 

demography (e.g. limpet densities) and region-specific life-history traits (e.g. time of reproduction and 

recruitment).  

This study provides important insights into both the potential use of microsatellites in addressing the 

genetic population structure of P. candei throughout Macaronesian archipelagos and the micro-

evolutionary processes that operated on the phylogeography of limpet populations across these 

isolated oceanic islands. In particular, it will be important to understand the scale and direction of 

connectivity among islands within each archipelago and to address inter-island population source–sink 

dynamics. For example, population genetic studies of the endemic Hawaiian limpets have shown 

significant subpopulation structures in three species of Cellana spp. Those results prompted their 

incorporation into management plans to deter previous poor conservation views of a single 

management unit (Bird et al. 2007).  

This novel multiplex microsatellite tool can be used to underpin the delimitation of suitable 

management areas by identifying barriers to dispersal within each archipelago, and provide the 

population genetic basis for the formulation of stock-specific conservation strategies for the 

sustainable exploitation of P. candei throughout Macaronesia. Genetic information can also be useful 

to assess the effectiveness of current marine protected areas acting as larvae source to adjacent 

populations. It is clear that these endemic species require careful management if extinction is to be 

avoided as appears to have happened with P. candei candei in much of its range in the Canary 

archipelago.

Background 

Patellid limpets are ecologically important keystone grazers having a long history of overexploitation in 

the Macaronesian Archipelagos (NE Atlantic islands), where some species, such as Patella aspera, 

are under serious risk (Hawkins et al. 2000; Martins et al. 2008). Patella aspera is a protandric 

sequential hermaphrodite species with external fertilization, in which individuals start as males but 

may undergo a sex reversal with age (Martins et al. 1987). Hence, exploitation tends to focus on the 

larger females in the population as larger limpets (predominantly females) are selectively removed. 

Despite conservation legislation in Canaries, Madeira and Azores, limpets are under severe pressure 

and few individuals survive long enough to become females, a phenomenon that severely restricts the 

effective population size (Waples 2006). New conservation actions for the protection and sustainable 

use of limpets in Macaronesian archipelagos are urgently needed and should be based on a 

multidisciplinary framework based on knowledge of the population dynamics and connectivity of this 

species.  

 

Samples, genetic analysis and results 

A total of 309 microsatellite loci were isolated from the P. aspera genome using a 454 sequencing 

platform, and three multiplex sets comprising 17 loci for rapid population genetic analyses were 

developed in this species (see Supplementary Material for methodological details; Table S1). Samples 

from three populations of P. aspera (n = 127) from the Macaronesian islands (two from the 

archipelago of Azores and one from the Canaries) were fully genotyped using capillary 

electrophoresis. Genetic diversity and population differentiation estimates were assessed. All loci were 

polymorphic, and a large deficit in heterozygosity was commonplace across markers and samples 

(Table 1; Table S2). Such a deficit probably arose as a consequence of complex population processes 

resulting from overexploitation as well as from the usual null allele impact in molluscan microsatellites. 

Nonetheless, no proper inferences on the causality of this phenomenon can be made until assessed 

by large-scale population genotyping studies.  

 

Table 1. Mean genetic diversity estimates based on 17 microsatellite loci for three Patella aspera populations from the 

Macaronesian islands of S. Miguel (Azores, SMI_1 and SMI_2) and Gran Canaria (Canaries, CAN). 

 

 



	 37 

Pairwise comparisons of diversity among the three populations analysed showed a significant FST 

distance in 12 of the 17 markers analysed (Table S2), averaging FST = 0.047 (P &amp;lt;0.001). Noteworthy, 

hierarchical AMOVAs showed that such interpopulation genetic distance was caused by the 

divergence between each of the Azorean samples and the Canarian sample (FST = 0.074, P &amp;lt;0.001), 

but not between the Azorean samples (FST = 0.017, P &gt; 0.01) (Table S3).  

 

Comments 

Despite the low number of samples analysed, present data suggest that the divergence found 

between archipelagos amounts to that expected between allopatric species rather than among 

conspecific populations. Next steps include the study of the genetic population structure of P. aspera 

throughout its distribution range so that future efforts can focus on identifying scales of connectivity 

and hence stock integrity across the Macaronesian Archipelagos. These novel tools can be useful to 

inform management of fisheries and preserve endemic limpet stocks that have been severely depleted 

in Macaronesia.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 

 

Methods 

Genomic DNA was extracted from foot tissue samples preserved in 96% ethanol using the E.Z.N.A. 

Mollusc DNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-tek). A DNA admixture from ten individuals (10 ?g ml-1) was 

used to build an enriched microsatellite library (Genoscreen, France). Fragments from genomic DNA 

were enriched in single sequence repeats using magnetic streptavidin beads and labelled 

oligonucleotide probes, i.e. (TG)n, (TC)n, (AAC)n, (AAG)n, (AGG)n, (ACG)n, (ACAT)n and (ACTC)n. 

High-throughput microsatellite isolation was made upon 454 GS-FLX® Titanium (Roche) 

pyrosequencing on the enriched library. A total of 28 992 raw sequences were produced and titrated 

with QDD software (Meglécz et al. 2010) to recover 4 754 sequences containing microsatellites. 

Validation of primer pairs was achieved on 309 reads comprising 89% dinucleotides, 9% trinucleotides 

and 2.0% tetranucleotides. Forty pairs of primers (25 di-, 14 tri-, and 1 tetranucleotides) with high and 

close melting temperature, compatible allelic ranges and no misspriming were tested individually and 

PCR gradient conditions were assayed to check for their polymorphism across 10 trial samples. 

Twenty-three markers were discarded due to artifactual PCR bands or monomorphism. A final set of 

17 optimally-amplified polymorphic loci showing amplicon size range of 110 bp - 353 bp was selected 

and their forward primers were fluorescently labelled with NED, VIC, PET, or 6?FAM (Applied 

Biosystems, Life Technologies) and a GTTT sequence “pig-tail” tag was added to the 5’ end of all 

reverse primers (Brownstein et al. 1996). Marker amplification was carried out in a MyCyclerTM thermal 

cycler (BioRad) using a touchdown PCR protocol on a final volume of 10 ?L containing 10 ng DNA 

template, 1 QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit 0.4 - 1.2 M of each primer and ddH2O. The PCR routine 

consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min; 5 cycles of touchdown amplification 

(denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing temperature (TA) for 1 min descending by 0.2°C intervals 

to the optimal TA (Table S1), plus extension at 72°C for 40 sec; 22 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, optimal 

TA (Table S1) for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 40 sec; 10 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 53°C for 50 

sec, 72°C for 45 sec; and a final extension step at 60°C for 30 min.? The 17 markers calibrated were 

combined in three multiplexed PCR sets for a more rapid and cost-efficient multilocus genotyping 

using AUTODIMER (Vallone and Butler 2004) (Table S1). 

Multiplex PCR followed a similar protocol as described above, whereas cycle adjustments were only 

applied to the touchdown amplification in all mixes and TA was lowered by 0.5°C on each consecutive 

cycle up to the optimal TA. Amplified fragments were electrophoresed in an ABI 3730 automatic DNA 

sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using the internal size standard GeneScanTM 500Liz® (Applied 

Biosystems) and genotypes were scored using GENEMAPPERTM v.4.2 (Applied Biosystems). The 

number of alleles per locus and sample, observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosities, 

inbreeding coefficients (FIS), deviations from the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage 

disequilibrium (LD) were estimated in GenAlEx v.6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012). Allelic richness (AR) 

was estimated after the rarefaction method implemented in ADZE v.1.0 (Szpiech et al. 2008). MICRO-



	 39 

CHECKER v. 2.2.3 was used to assess the presence of scoring errors and putative null alleles (van 

Oosterhout et al. 2004). Global and single-locus FST estimates were calculated with ARLEQUIN 

v.3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). Hierarchical partition of the genetic diversity within and 

between archipelagos was performed with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) as 

implemented in ARLEQUIN. Multiple statistical tests were nominally adjusted with the sequential 

Bonferroni method (Rice 1989).

CHAPTER 4 

Disentangling the genetic and morphological structure of Patella candei 
complex in Macaronesia (NE Atlantic)  

 

 

ABSTRACT  

The uptake of natural living resources for human consumption has triggered serious changes in the 

balance of ecosystems. In the archipelagos of Macaronesia (NE Atlantic), limpets have been 

extensively exploited probably since islands were first colonized. This has led to profound 

consequences in the dynamics of rocky shore communities. The Patella candei complex includes 

various subspecies of limpets that are ascribed to a particular archipelago and has been the focus of 

several taxonomic surveys without much agreement. Under a conservational perspective, we apply 

morphometric and genetic analyses to test subspecies boundaries in P. candei and to evaluate its 

current population connectivity throughout Macaronesia (Azores, Madeira, and Canaries). A highly 

significant genetic break between archipelagos following isolation by distance was detected (FST = 

0.369, P &amp;lt;0.001). Contrastingly, significant genetic differentiation among islands (i.e. Azores) was 

absent possibly indicating ongoing gene flow via larval exchange between populations. Significant 

shell-shape differences among archipelagos were also detected using both distance-based and 

geometric morphometric analyses. Adaptive processes associated with niche differentiation and 

strong barriers to gene flow among archipelagos may be the mechanisms underlying P. candei 

diversification in Macaronesia. Under the very probable assumption that populations of P. candei from 

each archipelago are geographically and/or ecologically isolated populations, the various subspecies 

within the P. candei complex may be best thought of as true species using the denomination: P. 

candei in Selvagens, Patella gomesii in Azores, Patella ordinaria in Madeira, and Patella crenata for 

Canaries. This would be in agreement with stock delimitation and units of conservation of P. candei 

sensu latu along Macaronesia.

1. Introduction 

Conservation efforts applied to human-exploited and threatened species requires a comprehensive 

knowledge about population structure and factors that shape differentiation within a species (Lande 

1988). For instance, natural and/or human-induced barriers across a species distributional range can 

hasten isolation between populations by restricting the amount of individuals that can freely migrate 

(Barber et al. 2000; Kelly and Palumbi 2010). Such constraints to connectivity can lead to genetically 

deprived populations that, in the face of intense human-exploitation, are likely to succumb and 

disappear. To overcome isolation, many species have evolved life-history traits that are able to 

maximize dispersion and connectivity across large geographical areas (e.g. White et al. 2011). For 

instance, many widely distributed marine organisms with limited adult movement avoid population 

differentiation by exhibiting large population sizes with high levels of fecundity and by releasing larvae 

that can potentially disperse in the water column for a considerable amount of time until they reach 

their final destination (e.g. Faria et al. 2013). However, the extent of successful dispersion, which is a 

major determinant of population dynamics and structure, is a function of multiple and often interacting 

factors. For instance, an extensively and well-mixed larval pool does not necessarily lead to 

widespread connectivity and lack of population genetic structure over large spatial scales (e.g. Keever 

et al. 2009). The complex interplay between physical processes (e.g. coastal topography, stratified 

water columns, tidal forces, wind, buoyancy, surface waves, and turbulence) and life-history traits (e.g. 

time of spawning, larval behaviour, growth and survival rates, pelagic larval duration), often interacting 

at fine to mesoscales, can result in a broad range of dispersal and metapopulation connectivity 

patterns (see review in Cowen and Sponaugle 2009). Similarly, historical events such as past 

glaciations and changes in sea level can determine the contemporary distribution of populations (e.g. 

Portnoy et al. 2014).  

In the last few decades, genetic methods have become a tool of excellence in investigating population 

differentiation estimates of a given species across its distributional range. Particularly, high-resolution 

nuclear markers such as microsatellites have been widely applied to conservation genetics (Guichoux 

et al. 2011) and to the identification of populations requiring prioritizing protective measures (e.g. 

Sandoval-Castillo and Beheregaray 2015). 

The Macaronesia comprises five NE Atlantic archipelagos: Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries and 

Cape Verde. The region is defined as a biogeographical entity based on the existence of many shared 

elements in the flora and fauna among archipelagos. All are of volcanic origin and have distinct but 

fairly recent geological times of origin (Ávila et al. 2016). Patellid limpets inhabiting these archipelagos 

are considered a valuable resource and have been intensively exploited presumably since islands 

were first colonized (Santos et al. 1995; Côrte-Real et al. 1996; Hawkins et al. 2000). In most islands, 

heavy exploitation has led to dramatic decreases in limpet abundances with current populations 

showing clear signs of over-exploitation (Martins et al. 2008; Martins et al. 2017). Because limpet’s 

grazing activity acts as a key process in shaping the structure and functioning of rocky shore 

communities (Hawkins and Hartnoll 1983), the chronic removal of limpets has led to an upward 

extension of turf-forming algae (see Boaventura et al. 2002; Martins et al. 2010). In fact, under 



	 47 

reduced numbers of limpets, algal spores can opportunistically grow to a size that allows them to 

escape grazing and thus form mature algal patches that are able to persist through time altering the 

community dynamics and energy flow (Coleman et al. 2006; Martins et al. 2010). 

The intertidal limpet Patella candei (d’Orbigny 1840), which is exclusive to Macaronesia, occurs on 

rocky shores from the mid intertidal down to 5 m depth across all archipelagos except in Cape Verde 

where it is absent (Christiaens 1973). They are broadcast spawners with fertilization occurring in the 

water column. According to Martins et al. (1987), P. candei is a gonochoric species that spawns 

throughout the year, without synchronized resting periods. While very few studies have sentenced the 

pelagic larvae duration (PLD) in species of the genus Patella (e.g. Dodd 1957; Ribeiro 2008) with 

gross estimates ranging from 2 - 32 days depending on the species, temperature and settlement cues, 

there is still no available information about the PLD of P. candei. Individuals of P. candei have a sub-

oval to stellate shell shape and an orange to greyish foot with a thin darker border. Morphological 

plasticity associated with specific micro-habitat conditions (i.e. substrate complexity) and 

environmental variation (i.e. wave exposure) is known to occur in this species (Hawkins et al. 1990). 

For instance, two distinct habitat-related morphs of P. candei are referred for the Azores: the ‘fly 

limpet’ and the ‘smooth limpet’ (Hawkins et al. 1990). Moreover, the morphological variation 

associated to each archipelago has led Christiaens (1973) to describe four distinct subspecies within 

P. candei complex: P. candei gomesii in Azores, P. candei ordinaria in Madeira, P. candei candei in 

Selvagens and P. candei crenata in the Canaries. This classification is not entirely supported by 

subsequent studies. For instance, Côrte-Real et al. (1996) found no differences in radular morphology 

and soft-body parts among archipelagos but showed that shell shape and allozyme characters from P. 

candei in Azores were clearly distinguished from P. candei in the Madeira and the Canaries. Weber 

and Hawkins (2002) also showed that P. candei shell shape could be distinguished among 

archipelagos and that allozyme retrieved two well-differentiated groups: P. candei from Azores and 

Selvagens, and P. candei from Madeira and Canaries. More recent research, using mtDNA, showed 

that samples of P. candei from the Azores, Madeira and Desertas (located about 25 km southeast of 

Madeira Island) form a well-supported group, while individuals sampled in Selvagens and Canaries 

always grouped together in a different clade (Sá-Pinto et al. 2005; 2008). The taxonomic status of 

Macaronesian limpets thus remains unclear with much controversy as to whether P. candei from the 

different archipelagos should be given a specific status. 

In this study, we use morphometric and molecular genetic methods to assess the existence of distinct 

groups of P. candei across Macaronesia, testing the subspecies boundaries within the species. At 

multiple spatial scales, we evaluate the degree of contemporary connectivity among populations and 

hypothesize that populations geographically closer to each other are likely more related and 

connected via larval dispersion. Besides the assessment of genetic diversity and structure of P. candei 

populations across archipelagos, and given the importance of defining conservation units in fisheries 

planning (Hawkins et al. 2016), we provide discussion and guidance about protective measures of 

such threatened marine resource, highlighting the importance of considering levels of genetic diversity 

in populations as well as their uniqueness.

2.1.1. Distance-based analyses 

Individuals of P. candei were collected across the Macaronesia archipelagos of Azores, Madeira, and 

Canarias, in 12 different islands (n = 917) during the summer of 2011 (Fig. 1). In all islands, individuals 

were collected on intertidal platforms. The soft tissue of all individuals was carefully removed for 

genetic analyses, and the shells were marked individually. Shell morphometry was examined using 

the procedure described in detail by Cabral (2007). In summary, five distances were measured on 

each shell: shell length (SL), shell maximum width (SW), shell width at apex (SWA), distance from 

apex to anterior tip (SAA), and shell height (SH). These distances were then used to calculate base 

ellipticity (BE), base eccentricity (BEC), conicity (CO), and cone eccentricity (CE) for each individual 

shell (see Cabral 2007 for further details). Shells were measured using a Vernier caliper with a 

precision of 0.1 mm. Individuals with signs of shell damage or with clear home fitting deformation were 

discarded from the analyses. The four variables were inspected for collinearity and removed from the 

analyses when collinearity was high (r &gt; 0.3).

Canaries (NE Atlantic). n columns indicate the number of individuals used for distance-based morphometrics, geometric 

morphometrics, and genetic analyses, respectively. 

 

Examination of the spatial variation in shell morphometry among archipelagos was analysed using a 

two-way fully hierarchical analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the following factors: archipelago (fixed) 

and island (random and nested within archipelago). Analyses were performed using PERMANOVA+ 

(Anderson et al. 2008) based on Euclidean distances and using 999 permutations. PERMANOVA is a 



	 49 

permutational-based test and produces results analogous to ANOVA when based on Euclidean 

distances (Anderson 2001). This test was preferred over classical ANOVA because it allows the use 

on unbalanced designs (e.g. different number of islands per archipelago). When needed, SL was used 

as a covariate in order to adjust for differences in morphometry with animal size. Prior to analysis, 

PERMDISP was used to test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions. All analyses were performed 

on untransformed data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine the linear 

combination of morphometric descriptors that account for the variation in the data. Shell-shape 

variation between P. candei morphotypes (“fly” and “smooth”) from Azores was also accessed by 

means of ANOVA. Given the difficulties in sorting all individuals into the “fly” and “smooth” categories, 

only distinctive shells of each morphotype were used in the analysis (n = 346). Note, however, that 

this criteria may upward bias the degree of differentiation between morphotypes. 

 

2.1.2. Geometric morphometric analyses 

A total of 83 P. candei collected across archipelagos were used for landmark-based geometric 

morphometric analysis (Bookstein 1991; Fig. 1). For imaging, shells were positioned in a light 

background and digital high-resolution images of the dorsal surface were captured using a CANON 

EOS 600D camera mounted on a tripod to maintain the distance for all samples and to ensure that the 

lens was parallel to the surface examined. The anterior–posterior axis of each specimen was identified 

using the scars from each individual body left on the ventral surface of the shell. A fan was used to 

position each specimen along such axis and ensuring that the apex of each shell coincided with the 

vertical line of the fan (Fig. S1). A tps file of each archipelago specimens was created using tpsUtil, 

and tpsDig2 (Rohlf 2015) was used to place a total of 37 landmarks on the shell apex and on the 

intersection of the fan and shell of each sample specimen image. Except for the shell apex landmark, 

all other points (at the shell border) do not necessarily represent homologous landmarks from a 

development point of view, but can be used to decompose objectively the shell shape of limpets. 

These points are referred to as semi-landmarks and can be used to capture information about 

curvature (Gunz and Mitteroecker 2013). Specimens were then aligned using a Generalized 

Procrustes Analysis (GPA) (Rohlf and Slice 1990) to remove all the differences due to translation, 

rotation, and scale (Bookstein 1991). In this process, semi-landmarks are allowed to slide along their 

tangent directions so as to minimize the bending energy between each specimen and the reference 

form. The resulting aligned Procrustes coordinates represent the shape of each specimen. For more 

details on geometric morphometric methodologies using landmarks, see Bookstein (1991), Zelditch et 

al. (2012), Adams et al. (2013). Centroid size (CS), given by the square root of the sum of squared 

distances of a set of landmarks from their centroid, was also calculated (Rohlf and Slice 1990). A 

Procrustes permutation analysis of variance (Procrustes ANOVA) performed with a residual 

randomization permutation procedure (Collyer et al. 2015; Adams et al. 2016) was used to determine 

patterns of shell shape variation between archipelagos. The aim is to test groups (archipelagos) 

considering the influence of phenotypic change associated with body size (i.e. body size was 

calculated from landmark configurations as centroid size). Actually, the Procrustes ANOVA between 



	 50 

shape and size, using CS is a way to assess interspecific allometry (Villegas et al. 2002). Because 

allometry was detected among archipelagos (see section 3), the full dataset was divided in two: one 

with small limpets (SMALL) and one with big limpets (BIG). Principal components analysis (PCA) was 

used to provide a graphical depiction of patterns of shape variation across the two datasets. Thin plate 

splines were used to provide a visual representation of the shape changes between each group mean 

and overall consensus configuration. All analyses and graphical representations were performed in R 

(R Core Team 2014) using the packages GEOMORPH (Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013). Geometric 

morphometric analysis was also used to determine shell shape variation between the “fly” and 

“smooth” P. candei morphotypes from Azores (n = 23 and n = 34, respectively). 

 

2.2. Genetic analysis 

2.2.1. Sampling and laboratory protocols 

A total of 560 individuals of Patella candei from the three archipelagos were used for genetic analysis 

(Fig. 1). Upon collection, limpets were preserved in 96% ethanol and frozen for later processing. At the 

laboratory, samples were subject to DNA extraction from the foot muscle tissue using the E.Z.N.A. 

Mollusc DNA extraction kit and following the manufacturer’ instructions. The quality and quantity of 

DNA extractions were assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). All 

individuals were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci using the primer pairs and following the 

amplification protocol described in Faria et al. (2016). Briefly, microsatellites were amplified in three 

distinct multiplex PCRs (PcaMix1: loci CAN18, CAN25, CAN27, CAN53; PcaMix2: loci CAN9, CAN26, 

CAN32, CAN40; PcaMix3: loci CAN23, CAN33, CAN56, CAN60) on 10 ?l reactions containing ~30 ng 

DNA template, 1 × QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit, 0.5 – 1.2 ?mol/L of each primer and ddH2O. 

Genotyping was performed on an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) automated DNA sequencer using an 

internal size standard (GeneScanTM 500Liz®, Applied Biosystems) for accurate sizing and 

GENEMAPPERTM v.4.2 (Applied Biosystems) was used for allele calling. 

 

2.2.2. Genetic variation 

Genetic diversity estimates such as allele frequencies and observed and expected heterozygosities 

(HO and HE) were estimated in GenAlEx v.6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 20012). The fixation index (FIS), 

linkage disequilibrium, and deviations from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested in 

GENEPOP v.4.2 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). Allelic richness [AR(g)] and private allele richness 

[AP(g)] were estimated using the rarefaction method implemented in ADZE v.1.0 (Szpiech et al. 2008). 

Whenever needed, the false discovery rate (FDR) control was employed to account for multiple testing 

(Verhoeven et al. 2005). The presence and frequency of null alleles was tested for each locus using 

MICROCHECKER v.2.2.3 (van Oosterhout et al. 2004) and FREENA (Chapuis and Estoup 2007), 

respectively. 

 



	 51 

2.2.3. Genetic differentiation and population structure  

Pairwise FST estimates among populations were calculated using FSTAT v.2.9.3 (Goudet 1995), and 

departures of FST from the null hypothesis of panmixia were evaluated via a permutation test (1 000 

iterations). The effect of null alleles in FST estimates was assessed by comparing FST before and after 

correction for null alleles using the excluding null alleles (ENA) method implemented in FREENA. 

Genetic differentiation between populations was also determined using the Dest estimator (Jost 2008) 

implemented in the R package DEMETICS v.0.8.4 (Gerlach et al. 2010), and P-values were estimated 

by bootstrap analysis (1 000 replicates). For all analyses involving multiple tests, significance levels 

were adjusted by the FDR method. 

The model-based approach implemented in STRUCTURE v.2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000) was used to 

identify the most likely number of populations (K) and assign individuals to genetic clusters. 

Assignment is conducted in ways that minimize deviations from Hardy–Weinberg and linkage 

equilibrium within each cluster. No particular population structure was assumed a priori (LOCPRIOR = 

0), and ten independent runs were carried out for each value of K (1–11). Length of the burn-in period 

was set to 1 × 105 followed by 5 × 105 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. Correlated allele 

frequencies and admixed populations were assumed. Modifications in such parameters produced 

consistency and did not change the final results. Selection of the most likely number of genetic 

clusters (K) was based on checking the posterior probability of the data for a given K (Pritchard et al. 

2000) and also by looking at the second-order rate of change in probability between successive K 

values as described in Evanno et al. (2005) and implemented in STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Earl 

and vonHoldt 2012). In systems with hierarchical population structure, STRUCTURE typically best 

resolves the highest level of population subdivision (Evanno et al. 2005). Thus, in order to resolve 

lower levels of subdivision, structure analyses were also conducted separately for each cluster 

identified. Therefore, two additional STRUCTURE analyses using the same settings were used to 

identify potential within-cluster structure. The best K was determined as previously described. 

A discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was also performed to identify and describe 

clusters of genetically related individuals (Jombart et al. 2010). DAPC has been shown to perform 

generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision (Jombart et al. 2010). 

DAPC is a multivariate analysis that integrates principal component analysis (PCA) together with 

discriminant analysis to summarize genetic differentiation between groups. DAPC is free of 

assumptions about Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium or linkage disequilibrium and provides graphical 

representation of divergence among populations. DAPC was performed with and without using prior 

group information using the R package ADEGENET (Jombart 2008). All STRUCTURE and DAPC 

analyses were conducted upon removal of non-amplifying loci. 

Tests for genetic differentiation among archipelagos were also conducted using analysis of molecular 

variation (AMOVA) in ARLEQUIN v.3.5.1.3 (Excoffier and Lischer 2010). Genetic variation among 

archipelagos (FCT), among populations within archipelagos (FSC) and within populations (FST) was 

assessed, and significance of F-statistics was tested using 10 000 permutations. Estimates of genetic 



	 52 

differentiation were also determined among the “fly” and “smooth” morphotypes of P. candei from 

Azores. 

 

2.2.4. Isolation by distance and gene flow 

To test for isolation by distance (Wright 1943), linearized FST transformation (FST  / [1 ? FST]) was 

regressed onto the natural log of geographic distances (GD; Rousset 1997). Regression with GD was 

also performed with the differentiation estimator Dest matrix. Regression analyses were performed in R 

and tested for significance with a Mantel permutation procedure. Moreover, given the heterogeneous 

nature of samples, the Monmonier’s maximum difference algorithm implemented in BARRIER v.2.2 

was used to highlight geographical features associated with genetic discontinuities among populations 

(see Manni et al. 2004 for method details). Analyses were conducted using pairwise FST values, and 

statistical confidence for each identified barrier was evaluated using 100 bootstrap replicates that were 

simulated using the package diveRsity in R. Analyses were also conducted separately for each 

amplifying microsatellite locus. 

Recent migration rates (m) among populations/clusters identified in STRUCTURE were estimated 

using the Bayesian multilocus genotyping procedure implemented in BAYESASS v.3.0 (Wilson and 

Rannala 2003). Analyses were only conducted among archipelagos due to the lower accuracy of 

BAYESASS when migration rates are high and genetic differentiation is low (see section 3) (Faubet et 

al. 2007). The program was run for 3 × 106 MCMC iterations with sampling at every 1 000 iterations, of 

which 106 iterations were discarded as burn-in. Delta values for allele frequency, migration rate, and 

inbreeding were adjusted so that the accepted numbers of changes were 40% – 60% of the total 

number of iterations. Ten MCMC runs with different initial seeds were carried out in order to maximize 

convergence and mixing. The Bayesian deviance was used as an optimality criterion to find the run 

with the best fit (Faubet et al. 2007). Deviance was calculated from the trace file using the R-script 

provided by Meirmans (2014). 

Contemporary gene flow was also estimated using the F-model on BIMr program (Faubet and 

Gaggiotti 2008). This software can estimate migration rates and detect migrants (within the last 

generation) at a lower level of population differentiation compared to BAYESASS (Faubet and 

Gaggiotti 2008). In addition, BIMr can identify the environmental factors that are more likely to explain 

the observed patterns using a generalized linear model. The method employs a Bayesian approach 

and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to make inferences of recent gene flows in 

subdivided populations (Faubet and Gaggiotti 2008). Preliminary trials included all populations but 

because population-specific FST values below 0.01 can be problematic for parameter estimation, 

analyses were performed on samples grouped according to the Bayesian clustering analyses results. 

Also, analyses were conducted with and without removing loci that failed to amplify in some 

populations and/or exhibited null alleles. Often considered one of the main factors in determining gene 

flow in many species, the geographic distance between samples was included as the environmental 

variable. A total of 20 independent replicate runs were performed. Each MCMC was run for a total of 

3.53 × 106 iterations, which included 30 short pilot runs of 1 000 iterations each in an effort to obtain 



	 53 

acceptance rates between 25% and 45%. The next 15 × 105 iterations were discarded as burn-in, and 

a total of 20 000 samples were collected from each of the 20 replicates using a thinning interval of 100 

iterations, using default settings. The posterior probabilities were evaluated for the run with the lowest 

Bayesian deviance (given by the assignment component of the total deviance: Dassign) (Faubet et al. 

2007; Faubet and Gaggiotti 2008). The mean, mode (point estimate), and 95% highest posterior 

density intervals (HPDI) for migration rates were recorded. 

 

3. Results 

3.1. Distance-based morphometrics 

Shell samples of P. candei ranged in size (SL) between 1.35 and 6.35 cm, with a mean size of 3.25 ± 

0.03 cm (mean ± SE). Although variable across islands (ANOVA, P &amp;lt;0.001), mean SL did not differ 

among archipelagos (ANOVA, P &gt; 0.05, Fig. S2, Table S1) but was significantly correlated with the 

remaining distance measures (SW, SWA, SAA, and SH) and also with BE (Table S2). Hence, only SL 

was used for analyses and considered as a covariate in the analysis of spatial variation of BE. Among 

the morphometric descriptors, conicity (CO) was positively correlated with BEC and CE and was 

therefore selected for analysis together with BE. Significant variation in the shape, as given by 

analyses of the descriptors CO and BE, was found at the scale of islands and among archipelagos 

(ANOVA, P &amp;lt;0.05, Tables S3 and S4). Variation in shell BE among archipelagos, although affected 

by size (SL), was relatively higher than variation among islands (Fig. 2). Similarly, for conicity, the 

largest proportion of the variability was found at the scale of archipelagos (Fig. 2). The first principal 

component (PC1) described 62.2% of the total variation, with the remaining variation (%) being 

accounted by the second principal component (PC2). The most important variable integrated by the 

first and second components was conicity and BE, respectively. The PCA showed that shell conicity 

can better distinguished shells from different archipelagos, whereas shell BE was mostly associated 

with differences within archipelagos (Fig. 3). Significant shell shape variation was also detected 

between the two P. candei morphotypes in Azores (ANOVA, P &amp;lt;0.01). Differences were only detected 

for shell conicity, with “fly limpets” being more conical then “smooth limpets.”

3.2. Geometric morphometrics 

The Procrustes ANOVA analysis on the full shell shape dataset revealed a significant interaction 

between archipelago and size, indicating an allometric growth in P. candei (Table 1). Moreover, the 

null hypothesis for common allometries (parallel slopes) among archipelagos was rejected (F = 5.364, 

P &amp;lt;0.001). The amount of shape change per unit of size change differed among archipelagos and 

was greater in Azores (indicated by the lengths of slope vectors) (Table 1; Fig. S3). Yet, shape 

trajectories and the way shapes change were only significantly different between Canaries and 

Madeira (indicated by the angles between slope vectors) (Table 1; Fig. S3). This corresponds to 

contrasting local deformations in particular parts of the landmark configuration associated with size 

change in these two archipelagos (e.g. note the changes in the shell apex landmark in Madeira and 

Canaries; Fig. S4). Significant differences in shell shape unrelated to size were detected among 

archipelagos for the two subsets (SMALL and BIG; Table S5). For both datasets, pairwise 

comparisons showed that Azorean and Canaries shells could not be distinguished (Table S5). The 

first two principal components of the Procrustes shape variables for each dataset accounted for 52 

and 53% of the total sample variation, respectively (Fig. 4). A generalized overlapping in the scatter of 

data was found, mostly between Azores and Canaries samples. Intraspecific variance was greatest in 

smaller shells from Madeira and Canaries, with individuals from these archipelagos occupying a much 

wider range of shape space than samples from Azores. Deformation grids for both SMALL and BIG 

datasets indicate that shell goes from a clear round shape to a more ridged and pointy look-alike 

shape along CV1 (left to right) (Fig. 4). On the same direction, the shell apex gets closer to the 

anterior margin of the shell. Similarly, the anterior end of the shell gets narrower along such axis. 

These shape changes are mostly associated and illustrate shell shape differences between 

Azores/Canaries and the Madeira samples. Whereas Azorean shells are oval with a smoother margin, 

the Canaries samples exhibit some ridges along their shell border. The pentagon look-alike shape of 

P. candei in Madeira stands out from the remaining archipelagos (Fig. S5). As for shell shape variation 

between P. candei morphotypes (“fly” and “smooth”) from Azores, the Procrustes ANOVA analysis 

revealed a significant interaction between morphotype and size, which is indicative of allometric 

growth. The null hypothesis for common allometries (parallel slopes) among morphotypes was

morphometric descriptors, conicity (CO) and

rejected (F = 7.459, P &amp;lt;0.01), and differences were detected in the amount of shape change per unit 

of covariate change (size) between morphotypes; shape change per size unit is higher in “fly” limpets 

(Table S6). Overall shape of P. candei in Azores is oval for both morphotypes but the shell apex in 

“fly” limpets tends to get closer to the anterior margin of the shell (Fig. S6).

3.3. Genetic analysis 

A total of 138 alleles were observed across the 12 loci examined, ranging from six in CAN26 and 

CAN56 to 22 alleles in CAN18 (Table S7). Five loci failed to amplify in individuals from Madeira and 

Canaries: Loci CAN9, CAN26, and CAN33 did not amplify at all in these two populations and two 

additional loci failed to amplify in more than 30% of both samples (Table S8). Since microsatellite 

markers were developed using P. candei from the Azores (see Faria et al. 2016), such amplification 

failure suggests a high genetic differentiation between Azores and the remaining archipelagos. 

Multilocus mean allelic richness with rarefaction was similar across populations and ranged from 3.6 

(GCA) and 4.7 (FAI). Mean number of private alleles was greater in the MAD population (AP[30] = 

1.14). Observed heterozygosity frequencies (HO) were relatively low and ranged from 0.157 to 0.364, 

while expected (HE) heterozygosity frequencies ranged from 0.304 to 0.484 (Table S7). No significant 

linkage disequilibrium was detected for any pairs of loci. Except for loci CAN23 and CAN53, all other 

loci deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Significant locus-specific inbreeding 

coefficients (FIS) ranged from 0.073 to 0.746 denoting a heterozygous deficit in such loci. Overall, 

significant FIS values were often ascribed with the presence of null alleles. To check for any bias in the 

results, loci with a presence of null alleles &gt; 10% were removed from the analysis. Such removal did 

not affect genetic differentiation results (data not shown) and unless stated otherwise, all loci were 

included in subsequent genetic analyses. In fact, the influence of null alleles has been shown to be 

marginal when compared to other factors such as number of loci and strength of population 

differentiation (Carlsson 2008). Pairwise comparisons of FST and Dest indicated high and significant 

genetic differences among archipelagos but not within archipelago (i.e., between islands in Azores) 

(Table 2). Both indices were highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation 0.99, P &amp;lt;0.001) (Fig. S7). 

Furthermore, FST values before and after correction for null alleles using the ENA method did not differ 

considerably (Table S9).

The STRUCTURE and DAPC analyses provided support for the genetic differentiation indicated by 

FST and Dest. In fact, the genetic structure inferred from the 560 individuals of P. candei and the 12 

microsatellite loci using the Bayesian model-based clustering algorithm, and the model-free DAPC 

clustering algorithm, provided similar results (Fig. 5). Two clusters (K = 2) were identified when 

considering all locations, with Azores samples being separated from the Madeira and Canaries 

populations. Similarly, two well-defined clusters were retrieved on the Madeira and Canaries 

assignment analysis. Both STRUCTURE and DAPC also suggested population homogeneity for P. 

candei in Azores (K = 1). In this case, for the STRUCTURE analysis, the estimated membership of 

individuals to any given cluster was roughly symmetric (~1/K in each population), indicating that 

individuals in Azores are widely admixed and belong to a single panmictic population (Fig. 5). Results 

from the Bayesian clustering analysis and DAPC were consistent with those obtained using AMOVA, 

which detected significant genetic differences among archipelagos. According to the AMOVA, 36.6% 

of the total genetic variation was found among archipelagos (P &amp;lt;0.001), 0.2% among populations of 

the same archipelago (P = 0.268), and 63.1% within populations (P &amp;lt;0.001). Furthermore, a 

significant positive relationship was observed between genetic differentiation estimators (FST and Dest) 

and geographic distance (Fig. 6). However, such relationship (IBD) is only endorsed among 

archipelagos and not within archipelago (i.e. populations from Azores are genetically undistinguished) 

(Fig. 6). The Monmonier’s algorithm in BARRIER revealed the existence of strong spatial barriers to

The results of the migration rates estimated in BAYESASS suggest a consistent restriction in 

contemporary gene flow between archipelagos (Table 3). Yet, from the individual assignments, two 

individuals sampled in Madeira had posterior probability estimates (0.13 and 0.44, respectively) as 

second-generation migrants from Canaries. One individual sampled in the Canaries had a probability 

of 0.24 to be a first-generation migrant from Madeira (Table S10). Estimates of current gene flow rates 

from BIMr for populations of P. candei were consistent across all preliminary trials and runs and 

showed mean values very close to 0 (Table 3). Such small estimates suggest effectively the absence 

of contemporary gene exchange among archipelagos. Moreover, the highest posterior probability was 

assigned to the model excluding distance as a factor (P[none] = 57.3; P[distance] = 42.7). The observed 

migration rates were independent of geographic distance as migration between archipelagos was 

similar and virtually absent.

migration rates from (A) BAYESASS (and 95% CI) and (B) BIMr (95% HPDI)  

 

 

4. Discussion 

Here, we investigate current signs of population differentiation and connectivity in the P. candei 

complex across Macaronesia (NE Atlantic). Our results revealed highly structured populations among 

archipelagos, which are likely associated with strong barriers to gene flow. Although isolation by 

distance (IBD) was detected among archipelagos, connectivity within archipelago (i.e. Azores) does 

not follow IBD, with genetic homogeneity among populations (i.e. islands) being maintained possibly 

via broad larval exchange. Moreover, shell shape differences among archipelagos were also detected 

and are likely the consequence of mixed effects of historical vicariance and re-colonization events, 

genetic drift, and local adaptations. 

Limitations to this study include the lack of samples from some Macaronesia islands (i.e., no samples 

from Selvagens and single samples from Canaries and Madeira), so that results among archipelagos 

cannot be fully explored in comparison with patterns within archipelagos. Despite this shortcome, the 

inclusion of samples from Madeira and Canaries allowed showing that the Patella candei complex 

across Macaronesia is highly differentiated and that each subspecies (or species) endorsed to a given 

archipelago should be treated as a single conservation unit.

4.1. Shell shape variation between archipelagos 

There have been few attempts to describe and distinguish limpet species and/or morphotypes using 

shell morphometry (e.g. Denny 2000; Cabral 2007). The difficulties of such methods rely on the fact 

that limpet shells have a sub-oval shape without any clear external homologous landmarks (except for 

the shell apex) or readily identifiable morphological features. Furthermore, due to the strong influence 

of certain environmental factors (i.e. wave exposure, substrate complexity, predation) many 

organisms, including limpets, exhibit high morphological plasticity (Branch and Marsh 1978; Lowell 

1986; Sokolova and Berger 2000; Guerra-Varela et al. 2009; Harley et al. 2009). The advent of 

modern techniques such as geometric morphometrics has furthered the ability of researchers to 

differentiate species and or specimens based on morphological characters (e.g. Baylac et al. 2003; 

Ruane 2015; Davis et al.  2016). In such sense, whereas distance-based methods are considered 

rather more simplistic in detecting shape differences between samples, the geometric analysis allows 

a more detailed recognition and assessment of how such shape varies with shell growth. Despite 

intrinsic different, generally, both methods allowed to distinguish P. candei morphotypes among and 

within archipelagos. The differences found between both methods are likely associated to (1) the fact 

that distance-based data contain relatively little information about shape because many of the 

measurements overlap and/or are correlated to each other, and shape can only be derived from ratios 

among particular measurements and (2) the inclusion of shell height to the distance-based method 

provides a third dimension, which is absent in geometric morphometrics that only considers a two-

dimensional reduction of shape in current analyses. Depicting the results, distance-based methods 

show that samples from Azores exhibit a more conical and elliptical shell shape compared to samples 

from the Canaries and Madeira, with the later descriptor being influenced by size. In fact, shell shape 

allometries derived from geometric morphometrics differ among archipelagos, and globally, 

differences are mostly found between Madeira samples and the remaining archipelagos; both small 

and large limpets from Azores and Canaries are more similar between them than with samples from 

Madeira. Whereas genetic data suggest a closer relationship between P. candei from Madeira and 

Canaries populations (see sections 3 and 4), shell shape differences are more thinned between P. 

candei from Azores and Canaries. This variation in morphology does not need to be necessarily 

consistent with genetic variation, especially because neutral markers such as microsatellites can be 

subject to distinct evolutionary forces than selected loci (McKay and Latta 2002). 

Shell shape variation in P. candei among archipelagos seems to be associated with mixed effects of 

ancient vicariance events, genetic drift and particular local adaptations under restrictive gene flow that 

acted together to produce such dissimilarities. For instance, the genetic stochasticity associated with 

distinct evolutionary histories such as time of colonization in each archipelago and/or specific 

retraction and expansion demographic events under limited gene flow may have contributed to the 

observed morphological variation. These mechanisms are likely responsible for the occurrence of 

several patellid species with considerable differentiation in shell shape on similar habitats across 

Macaronesia. For example, in Madeira, P. candei and Patella piperata have an overlapping intertidal 



	 61 

distribution, even though the shell of P. piperata is more round shaped and exhibits small black 

granules along its shell. Historical and/or contemporary diverging local selection pressures, and subtle 

differences in temperatures, hydrodynamic forces, substrate composition, community assemblages, 

and available competitors among archipelagos are also likely to have played a key role in determining 

variation in limpet shell shape on such remote islands. Moreover, the adaptive phenotypic plasticity 

associated with multiple environmental conditions, which is common in many intertidal molluscs (e.g. 

Wolf et al. 1997; Trussell 2000), can also determine geographic variation. Within the Azorean 

archipelago, such phenotypic plasticity is evident in the two well-recognized habitat morphs: The “fly 

limpet” which is highly conical and commonly found upper on the shore, mostly on more rugose 

surfaces; and the “smooth limpet” which is more flattened and associated to surfaces highly exposed 

to hydrodynamic forces (Hawkins et al. 1990). Under particular circumstances, such phenotypic 

plasticity can set the baseline for sympatric speciation and evolutionary divergence of habitat morphs 

(see Agrawal 2001). In fact, environmental stress gradients in coastal intertidal habitats related to 

heat, desiccation, salinity, and wave action can provide the adequate setting for adaptive processes in 

patellids (Branch 1981). If reproductive isolation is enforced by the ecological characteristics of each 

habitat, then biological separated species can be revealed. A good example comes from the 

diversification in Nacella limpets in the Magellanic Province (South America) (González-Wevar et al. 

2011). Ecological speciation and restricting levels of gene flow resulting from ecologically based 

divergent selection are considered the main driving processes of such diversification. The possibility of 

speciation along ecological gradients, without the need of a complete allopatric isolation, has also 

been shown for the Hawaiian endemic limpets of the genus Cellana (Bird et al. 2011). 

 

4.2. Population genetic structure and contemporary connectivity 

Genetic differentiation estimates among archipelagos revealed a highly structured pattern in the P. 

candei complex across Macaronesia. Populations of P. candei from Azores are the most isolated and 

exhibit the highest level of differentiation from the remaining archipelagos. To a lesser extent, 

populations from Madeira and Canaries, which are about 400 km apart, also show significant genetic 

differentiation and limited contemporary connectivity. In fact, migratory events between Madeira and 

Canaries are unlikely, if not entirely absent, despite the fact that these archipelagos are geographically 

closer to each other. Only three individuals showed a very slightly probability of being migrants 

between these two archipelagos. Selvagens islands, which stand at approximately two-thirds of the 

way between Madeira and the Canary Islands, and could act as a putative stepping stone for gene 

flow requires further examination. As for Azores, despite the wide geographical distribution of its 

islands across (~ 600 km), the minimum and maximum distances among any pair of adjacent islands 

that pelagic larvae must travel among islands are approximately 32 and 220 km, respectively. Such 

distances do not seem to offer an obstacle and allow populations’ gene pool across all islands to be 

homogenized via larval transport. Although genetic differentiation among archipelagos seems to be 

highly correlated with geographic distance, the unbalanced nature of sampling, the fact that 

connectivity within archipelago (i.e. Azores) does not follow IBD, and the results provided by 



	 62 

BARRIER (see Fig. 7) and BIMr analyses, suggest that the most likely barriers to gene flow in P. 

candei across the Macaronesia archipelagos are also associated to historical and contemporary 

limitations imposed by the masses of water that separate them, and are not a direct result of the 

geographical distance per se. In this case, the historical shifting of ocean circulation processes and 

the current oceanographic complexity and mesoscale variability across Macaronesia, with meanders, 

high eddy kinetic energy, upwellings, and several masses with distinct thermohaline characteristics 

(see Johnson and Stevens 2000; Alves et al. 2002; Rogerson et al. 2004), may have acted as a strong 

physical barriers to gene exchange among archipelagos. Such barriers to gene flow, however, cannot 

fully exclude limitative dispersal across space or IBD pattern in P. candei throughout Macaronesia. Not 

only larval mortality rates increase almost exponentially as they move away from the coast into 

offshore waters (Cowen et al. 2000), but the PLD of P. candei may also be shorter than expected, or 

of a narrower range of what is generally referred for other patellids (Ribeiro 2008). Under such 

scenario, because larvae are less likely to travel longer distances, populations farther away from each 

other would be more genetically distinct. 

The failure of some microsatellites, which were isolated from the genome of P. candei samples from 

Azores, in amplifying individuals from Madeira and Canaries may further suggest substantial genetic 

break among archipelagos. The reduced marker polymorphism in southern samples may reflect 

pronounced sequence differences among subspecies due to their genetic divergence, thus entailing 

an upward ascertainment bias as markers were developed from Azorean morphotypes. This may 

explain the contrasting results of this study and those provided by Sá-Pinto et al. (2005, 2008). In their 

study, samples from Azores and Madeira grouped together in a well-supported clade, leaving 

Canaries more distant related. According to the same authors, the scenario of a single colonization 

event for each archipelago associated with the absence of historical gene flow between them is the 

most likely. The direction and timing of such colonization events is still unclear, and methods such as 

the approximate Bayesian computation (Beaumont et al. 2002) may be useful in contrasting 

demographic hypothesis about the evolutionary history of limpets in Macaronesia, provided that all 

archipelagos are sampled (including Selvagens). Even so, it seems plausible to accept that upon a 

single event of colonization, limpet populations in each archipelago remained isolated and 

evolved/adapted allopatrically to the environmental specificities of each archipelago. It is thought that 

P. candei candei from the Selvagens islands is the ancestral species that first colonized the Canaries 

and Madeira and only later the Azores (Weber and Hawkins 2002; Sá-Pinto et al. 2008). This 

evolutionary pattern tracks each archipelago’s time of origin with Selvagens being the oldest (~ 29.5 

Ma) and Azores the youngest (&amp;lt;6 Ma), but the exact sequence of colonization is still unresolved. 

Changes in sea level and ocean circulation associated with major historical episodes such as the 

tectonic closure of the Isthmus of Panama (Haug and Tiedemann 1998), the Plio-Pleistocene glacial 

cycles (Maggs et al. 2008), and the closing off of the western basin of the Mediterranean from the 

Atlantic (Krijgsman et al. 1999) may have contributed to the expansion and allopatric differentiation of 

P. candei throughout Macaronesia. As suggested for the endemic Macaronesia periwinkle Tectarius 

striatus (den Broeck et al. 2008), P. candei may have colonized Macaronesia in periods when sea 

levels were lower, so that seamounts peaked above sea level and acted as stepping stones between 



	 63 

archipelagos. Therefore, adaptive processes associated with niche differentiation and 

physical/geographical isolation among populations may correspond to the underlying mechanisms for 

P. candei diversification in Macaronesia. In the absence of gene flow between populations, 

reproductive isolation would arise gradually as a result of mutation, genetic drift and natural selection 

driven by differences in local environmental conditions (Hoskins et al. 2005). In fact, allopatric 

speciation under restrictive gene flow is believed to be one of the most common modes of speciation 

in nature (Schluter 2009). Yet, providing that reproductive isolation is complete, secondary events of 

colonization followed by the weakening of physical/ geographical barriers are not to be excluded and, 

for instance, may have contributed to the coexistence of P. candei candei (the Selvagens ecotype) 

and P. candei crenata in Canaries islands; although isolated specimens of P. candei candei were 

identified in El Hierro and Tenerife islands, this co-occurrence is now mainly restricted to a single 

island: Fuerteventura (González-Lorenzo et al. 2016). 

 

4.3. Conservation of limpet population in Macaronesia 

The aim of conservation is not simply to safeguard species from going extinct, but also to guarantee 

that morphological and genetic variation in natural populations is preserved. Efforts toward ensuring 

the conservation of limpet populations in Macaronesia are highly recommended, especially 

considering that their low genetic diversity and lack of gene exchange between archipelagos suggest 

they may be highly vulnerable. Taking into account its endemic nature and the negative impact of 

over-exploitation in coastal communities, the risk of complete extinction of P. candei in Macaronesia is 

therefore conceivable. Yet, because our study failed to detect the occurrence of population 

bottlenecks, which would be expected under the known demographic decline of P. candei in 

Macaronesia, the effective population sizes must be still large enough to prevent critical losses to 

genetic variability (see Pujolar et al. 2011). However, when comparing to unexploited populations of 

patellids elsewhere (e.g. Perez et al. 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2010), genetic diversity in the P. candei 

complex is fairly low. Despite the challenges associated with such comparisons, especially because 

different microsatellite loci may generate different levels of variation, the reduced genetic diversity 

observed can be a consequence of high levels of population inbreeding caused by intensive 

exploitation. As harvesting is mainly aimed at larger individuals (Martins et al. 2008), the more fertile 

individuals with higher reproductive outputs are likely less abundant than expected. This may lead to 

severe evolutionary and ecological consequences for the biology, life-history traits, and survival of the 

species (Fenberg and Roy 2008). 

Our results support the view that populations from each archipelago should be managed for 

conservation as distinct units. Within the P. candei complex, P. candei candei is considered in danger 

of extinction under the Spanish Catalogue of Endangered Species and is now mainly restricted to one 

single island: Fuerteventura (Canary Islands). This is likely a consequence of overexploitation (Núñez 

et al. 2003), but selective and evolutionary-related processes may have also been involved (González-

Lorenzo et al. 2016). Recently, a forced ban to its capture and a conservational plan has been put in 

place by regional authorities. Aside from Fuerteventura, P. candei candei occurs more abundantly in 



	 64 

the Selvagens, uninhabitable islands that are protected under the Portuguese status of Nature 

Reserve. As for the remaining limpets, each Regional authority has established protective measures 

and rules for their harvesting. Legislation does not differ much among regions, with the establishment 

of limpet no-take areas, minimum legal catch sizes, and seasonal fishing closures. Unfortunately, 

these actions have been largely ineffective in protecting such resource (Martins et al. 2011; López et 

al. 2012; Diogo et al. 2016; Riera et al. 2016), mostly because of illegal harvesting and lack of or 

insufficient enforcement. Protective measures need to be adjusted to the particular life-history traits of 

P. candei in each archipelago (e.g. temporal variation in reproduction, recruitment, population 

dynamics). Furthermore, both environmental awareness programs to general population and coastal 

enforcement by local authorities should be stimulated. Above all, we suggest the establishment of fully 

enforced closed zones to limit the access to rocky shore poachers and allow limpet populations to 

grow in numbers and individual sizes. These off-limit areas should be regularly surveyed and take into 

consideration population connectivity patterns within archipelagos. Our data suggest that, at least for 

Azores, such areas should distance no more than ~ 200 km, to allow proper gene exchange between 

populations. Additional sampling throughout all Macaronesia islands can further sharpen our 

knowledge about connectivity patterns in P. candei and help better defining the establishment of such 

areas within each archipelago. 

Under the very probable assumption that P. candei from each archipelago forms a geographically 

and/or ecologically isolated population, the various subspecies within the P. candei complex as 

previously proposed by Christiaens (1973) may be best thought as true species using the 

denomination: Patella candei in Selvagens, Patella gomesii in Azores, Patella ordinaria in Madeira, 

and Patella crenata for Canaries. Whether this would facilitate current taxonomic misinterpretations 

and conservation needs, further research is still required, especially in diagnosing intrinsic 

reproductive isolation (Frankham et al. 2012). Ultimately, this elevation of subspecies to species level 

would be in agreement with stock delimitation and units of conservation (Hawkins et al. 2016) with 

potential benefits for management plans aimed at the preservation of limpets stocks across the 

Macaronesia region.

CHAPTER 5 

Inbreeding in the exploited limpet Patella aspera across the Macaronesia 
archipelagos (NE Atlantic): implications for conservation 

 

 

ABSTRACT  

The genetic erosion of populations exposed to human exploitation plays a detrimental role on a 

species ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The Macaronesia (NE Atlantic) endemic 

limpet Patella aspera (Röding 1798) has been subject to overexploitation throughout its geographic 

distribution. We analysed 841 limpet specimens from eleven islands across the archipelagos of 

Azores, Madeira and Canaries. Results from 11 nuclear microsatellite markers showed significant 

population structure between populations from Azores and populations from Madeira and Canaries, 

and absence of current or historic gene flow between these. M-ratios showed that both population 

clusters have experienced demographic changes over time. Heterozygote deficits were common 

across populations, which can be better accounted for by inbreeding than by null alleles or Wahlund 

effect. Such levels of inbreeding are likely a consequence of a significant reduction of reproductive 

units due to decades of intensive exploitation. As a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite, the size-

selective harvesting of larger individuals likely fosters unbalanced sex-ratios and a consequent 

reproductive shortage. A recent compensatory hypothesis suggests that males are compensating the 

removal of larger females by undergoing sex change earlier and presumably at smaller sizes, as an 

adaptive response of the species under high size-biased fishing pressure. Despite such response, a 

dramatic reduction of Ne emerging from a large variation in the reproductive success due to 

overfishing and artificial genetic drift, can simply explain the inbreeding scenario observed in this 

Macaronesia endemic key species. This study provides valuable insights for management and 

conservation of P. aspera throughout Macaronesia.

1. Introduction 

The most obvious consequences of living resources uptake by humans are the reduction of the 

targeted population size and biomass (e.g. Christensen et al. 2014). Fisheries research has long 

provided examples of such disruptive impacts on natural systems (Hutchings and Reynolds 2004). At 

the population-level, fishing can alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes 

in species abundance (e.g. Jennings et al. 1999; Genner et al. 2010). Selective fisheries can also shift 

the community composition and the dynamics of an entire ecosystem, with known cascading effects 

on other taxa and biota (e.g. McClanahan et al. 1996; Myers et al. 2007; Casini et al. 2008; Smith et 

al. 2011). Moreover, the mean trophic level targeted by global fisheries has been decreasing over 

recent decades, shifting from large piscivorous fishes to smaller invertebrates and planktivorous 

fishes, leading to major changes in the structure of marine food webs (Pauly et al. 1998; Jackson et al. 

2001). 

Less noticeable are the genetic changes brought about by exploitation. These include the genetic 

subdivision of populations and the loss of genetic variation, which are thought to increase the risk of 

extinction via reductions in resilience and ability to recover following anthropogenic disturbances 

(Allendorf et al. 2008; Pinsky and Palumbi 2014). In fact, fisheries-induced genetic changes are known 

to affect a number of life-history traits that often reduce the capacity for a population to recover. For 

example, the most usual size-selective fishing for larger individuals can negatively affect traits such as 

fecundity, maturation and larval growth in many marine organisms (Walsh et al. 2006; Swain et al. 

2007).  

As many other fisheries, the removal of limpets has a profound impact on the ecosystem. It is known 

that grazing by limpets not only determines macroalgal biomass overall (Hawkins et al. 1992), but also 

modifies ecosystem stability (Coleman et al. 2006). In fact, current dominance of intertidal algal turfs 

on many islands of Macaronesia is largely attributed to the virtual absence of patellid species due to 

overharvesting (Martins et al. 2008). Moreover, algal dominance means that there is little bare rock left 

for the settlement of new limpet recruits. 

The most economically valuable limpet species across the region is Patella aspera (Röding 1798), 

which is present in all Macaronesia archipelagos with the exception of Cape Verde, and occurs on 

rocky shores from the lower intertidal down to 20 m depth. P. aspera is a protandrous (sequential 

hermaphrodite) species with external fertilization, that reaches sexual maturity around 40 mm in shell 

length (Martins et al. 1987). In such species, individuals start as males, with the majority switching 

later in life to female. P. aspera is more reproductively active during winter/ early spring months with 

summer defined as a gonad maturation resting period (Martins et al. 1987; Vale 2016). Gametes are 

released into the water column and, upon fertilization, competent larvae can spend between to 2 to 32 

days before they settle on hard substrate. These are temperature-dependent estimates that have 

been determined for other patellid species and may not reflect the true pelagic larvae duration of P. 

aspera (see Ribeiro 2008). P. aspera is assumed to have speciated from its congeneric European 

continental form Patella ulyssiponensis (Koufopanou et al. 1999; Weber and Hawkins 2005) probably 

between 8 - 4 Ma (Sá-Pinto et al. 2008). Lack of gene flow between insular and continental 



	 85 

populations, presumably after the establishment of extant ocean current patterns following the uplift of 

Panama isthmus, has made P. aspera more vulnerable to exploitation.  

A key challenge of fisheries management is the correct definition of effective stocks (Hawkins et al. 

2016). This is vital to ensure that natural resources and the fishery are managed at the appropriate 

spatial scale. Although the reliability of such definition may be better achieved by using multiple stock 

identification techniques concurrently (e.g. see holistic approach in Begg and Waldman 1999), 

molecular procedures have been more recently used to provide a genetic basis for aiding in stock 

identification (e.g. Griffiths et al. 2010; Dann et al. 2013). Moreover, molecular data can allow the 

understanding of the way populations in different geographic regions are connected via larval transfer 

or isolated from one another. In the event that connectivity exists among Macaronesia archipelagos, 

P. aspera could still maintain enough potential for local sustainability, provided that depleted stocks 

could be enhanced by natural gene flow from adjacent and/or more distant populations. However, 

experimental knowledge on such connectivity remains largely unknown so far. Here we used 

molecular data to identify patterns of genetic diversity and to test the null hypothesis of spatially 

homogeneous interbreeding and gene flow in P. aspera across Macaronesia, by studying the degree 

of genetic divergence between putative populations. We discuss possible implications of this study for 

fisheries management and conservation of such biologically, culturally and economically important 

endemic species across the region. 

 

2. Methods 

2.1. Sampling and laboratory procedures 

A total of 841 individuals of P. aspera were collected across the Macaronesia archipelagos of Azores, 

Madeira and Canaries (Fig. 1). Individuals were labelled, and foot tissue samples were collected and 

preserved in 96% ethanol. Genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissue using the E.Z.N.A. 

Mollusc DNA extraction kit following manufacturer’s instructions (Omega Bio-tek). All DNA samples 

were quantified and checked for purity in a NanoDropTM spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). 

Seventeen species-specific polymorphic microsatellite markers were amplified with fluorescently 

labelled primers following the PCR conditions described in Faria et al. (2015) (see Supplementary 

Material for methodological details).  

 

2.2. Genetic diversity 

Standard genetic diversity measures such as allele frequencies, expected (HE) and observed (HO) 

heterozygosities and inbreeding coefficients (FIS) within populations for each locus and over all loci 

were calculated using GENALEX v.6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012). Deviations from Hardy–Weinberg 

equilibrium (HWE) and genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD) among all pairs of loci were tested using 

exact tests implemented in GENEPOP v.4.1 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). Because loci involved in 

significant linkage disequilibrium tests were detected, all subsequent analyses were performed on a 



	 86 

reduced dataset of 11 loci. Allelic richness (AR) and private allelic richness (AP) were calculated in HP-

Rare (Kalinowski 2005) with a rarefaction sample size (in genes) of 10 due to missing data. Statistical 

significance for these parameters were tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in R v.3.3.0 (R Core 

Team 2014). Results for multiple testing were adjusted by applying the false discovery rate (FDR) 

correction approach (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). As large heterozygote deficits are common in 

marine invertebrates (Addison and Hart 2005), FREENA (Chapuis and Estoup 2007) was used to 

detect the presence of null alleles and quantify their frequency. Evidence for null alleles can be found 

in deviations to HWE, more precisely in the significant excess frequency of homozygous genotypes. 

Neutrality of the markers was tested using LOSITAN software (Antao et al. 2008) (see Supplementary 

Material for methodological details).

Canaries (NE Atlantic).  

 

2.3. Population structure 

Genetic differentiation among population was estimated from the pairwise FST using the so-called ENA 

method described in Chapuis and Estoup (2007). This approach aims to correct for the positive bias 

induced by the presence of null alleles on FST estimation; 95% confidence intervals for the FST values 

were obtained using 10 000 bootstrap iterations and FST estimates obtained with and without applying 

the ENA algorithm were compared by means of a two tailed t-test. For comparative purposes, pairwise 

FST resulting from an analysis of molecular variance performed between each pair of populations 

(AMOVA) was also estimated in GENODIVE v.2.0b25 (Meirmans and van Tienderen 2004); statistical 

significance was tested by means of a permutation procedure across loci, followed by the FDR 



	 87 

correction for multiple testing. Genetic differentiation between populations was also determined using 

the Dest estimator (Jost 2008) implemented in the R package DEMETICS v.0.8.4 (Gerlach et al. 2010) 

and P-values were estimated by bootstrap analysis (1 000 replicates). To test for isolation by distance 

(Wright 1943), linearized FST-ENA transformation (FST / [1- FST]) was regressed onto the natural 

logarithm of geographic distance (GD) (Rousset 1997) in R and tested for significance with a Mantel 

permutation procedure. POWSIM v.4.0 (Ryman and Palm 2006) was used to determine the power of 

the markers to detect significant genetic differentiation at various levels of FST (see Supplementary 

Material for methodological details). 

Genetic population structure was assessed using the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in 

STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 2000) (see Supplementary Material for methodological details). 

The most likely number of K pools was selected using the ?K method described in Evanno et al. 

(2005) and implemented in STRUCTURE HARVESTER v.0.6.94 (Earl and vonHoldt 2012). The 

results of ten replicate runs for each value of K (putative number of gene pools) from 1 to 11 were 

averaged in CLUMPP v.1.1.2 (Jakobsson and Rosenberg 2007) and summary outputs were displayed 

graphically in DISTRUCT v.1.1 (Rosenberg 2004). Analyses were also conducted on a reduced 

dataset by excluding loci with a higher frequency of null alleles (e.g. Baums et al. 2012). Because the 

high frequency of null alleles at most loci and populations might lead to overestimation of the number 

of K pools, the robustness of STRUCTURE results was tested using another Bayesian inference 

method provided by GENELAND (Guillot et al. 2005) and implemented in R package (see 

Supplementary Material for methodological details). AMOVA as implemented in ARLEQUIN v.3.5.2.2 

(Excoffier and Lischer 2010) was also used to characterize the genetic structure and variance within 

and between clusters identified in STRUCTURE and GENELAND analyses; significance was tested 

after 1 000 permutations. Genetic diversity statistics were applied to each of the clusters identified with 

Bayesian analyses of population structure. 

 

2.4. Unbiased estimates of inbreeding 

Because homozygosity in P. aspera can be a consequence of harvesting-related inbreeding, the 

individual inbreeding model (IIM) implemented in the software INEST v.2.0 (Chybicki and Burczyk 

2009) was used to simultaneously estimate null allele frequencies and inbreeding coefficients (fixation 

index, FIS-INEST). This Bayesian approach allowed the calculation of unbiased estimates of inbreeding 

within a population after accounting for null alleles. Within INEST, two models were tested: firstly the 

full model which accounts for genotyping failures (b), inbreeding (f) and null alleles (n) and secondly 

the random mating model (i.e. when f is fixed at 0). The Deviation Information Criterion (DIC) is then 

used for model comparison. Support is given to an inbreeding effect when the lowest DIC is found in 

the nfb model. Also, to evaluate the effect of null alleles on F-statistics, uncorrected FIS for each 

population was regressed onto the frequency of null alleles. 

 

 



	 88 

2.5. Bottleneck detection and gene flow 

The heterozygosity excess test in BOTTLENECK v.1.2.02 (Cornuet and Luikart 1996) was used to test 

for evidence that populations had experienced recent genetic bottlenecks. Demographic declines were 

also assessed for the inferred clusters using the M-ratio test as implemented in M_p_val (Garza and 

Williamson 2001). Recent migration among clusters was estimated using the Bayesian assignment 

test implemented in BAYESASS v.3.0 (Wilson and Rannala 2003). All bottleneck and migration 

analyses were repeated after discarding loci with &gt; 20% proportion of null alleles (see Dakin and Avise 

2004) (see Supplementary Material for bottleneck and migration analyses details). 

 

3. Results 

3.1. Genetic diversity 

All microsatellite loci were highly polymorphic with no significant differences in allelic richness among 

populations (single locus AR ranging between 1.8 and 6.6; Table S1 and Table S2). Conversely, 

private allelic richness (AP) was significantly higher in the Canaries population (P &amp;lt;0.05) in most 

pairwise comparisons. Observed heterozygosity was relatively low and similar across populations with 

a mean value of 0.309 ± 0.165 SD (Table S1). The expected mean heterozygosity was 0.691 ± 0.154 

SD and all loci deviated from HWE. The estimated frequency of null alleles ranged from 0.07 to 0.36. 

There was no evidence for selection at any locus (Fig. S1). 

 

3.2. Population structure 

Significant genetic differentiation (after FDR correction) was found in 34 out of 55 pairwise FST-GENODIVE 

comparisons (Table 1). FST-GENODIVE ranged from 0 to 0.114 and was not significantly different from FST-

FREENA corrected for null alleles (t-test, P &gt; 0.05). Higher values were mainly observed between Azores 

and Madeira plus Canaries. Dest estimates were proportionally higher than FST estimates and yielded 

similar statistical significance values (Table 1).

Regression analysis showed that F-statistics might have been highly overestimated in the presence of 

null alleles (Fig. S2) and can therefore affect FST estimates and their significance among populations, 

especially on those that are putatively more closely related such as the Azorean populations. Power 

analysis in POWSIN indicated that the number of individuals and the number of loci used in this study 

provide strong support to identify weak differentiation among populations at a true FST as low as 

0.0025 with a statistical power of 100% for both Fisher’s exact test and the chi-square test. 

There was a strong signature of isolation by distance among archipelagos (Fig. 2, r2 = 0.541; P &amp;lt;

0.001), but genetic differentiation within the Azores did not seem to relate to geographic distance (Fig. 

2, r2 = 0.069; P &gt; 0.12). STRUCTURE analyses performed under mixed ancestry and sampling 

locations as prior information, and the ?K metric of Evanno et al. (2005) revealed that K = 2 was the 

most likely number of gene pools/ clusters for P. aspera in Macaronesia (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3, 

respectively). Two distinct clusters were identified: one involving all Azorean populations and another 

grouping Madeira and Canaries. Population structure became less evident when analytical parameters 

and settings were changed in STRUCTURE, especially when prior information for population origin 

was not implemented (see Fig. S4). The spatial model in GENELAND, bearing a correction for null 

alleles, estimated the number of clusters for P. aspera in Macaronesia as two, in agreement with initial 

STRUCTURE results (Fig. 3): a northern group encompassing all Azorean populations and a southern 

group including Madeira and Canaries populations. A significant genetic differentiation among clusters 

was also detected through AMOVA analyses; most of the total variance was due to variation within 

populations (Table S3).

The genetic diversity of each cluster was similar to those obtained for population/location level 

analyses (Table 2). Mean observed and expected heterozygosity in the first cluster (all samples from 

Azores) were 0.315 ± 0.160 SD and 0.701 ± 0.150 SD, respectively. For the second cluster (Madeira 

and Canaries samples), the observed mean heterozygosity was 0.285 ± 0.173 SD and the expected 

mean heterozygosity was 0.697 ± 0.188 SD.

GENELAND analyses.  

 

 

3.3. Inbreeding 

The multilocus “null free” average inbreeding coefficient (FIS) as calculated with INEST varied between 

0.113 and 0.497 (Table S1). Model comparison using INEST suggests that the heterozygote deficit 

observed in the dataset is better accounted for by inbreeding than by null alleles. In all cases, the nfb 

model had the lowest DIC (Table S4). Similarly, model comparison with INEST on the two clusters 

identified through Bayesian analyses also indicated that heterozygosities deficits are more related to 

inbreeding rather then to null alleles presence: the “null free” inbreeding coefficient FIS-INEST for each 

cluster was 0.399 (95% confidence interval: 0.368 - 0.431) and 0.104 (95% confidence interval: 0.043 

- 0.272), respectively (Table 2). 

 

 



	 92 

3.4. Bottleneck detection and gene flow 

The heterozygosity excess test implemented in BOTTLENECK did not find evidence for a recent 

demographic bottleneck in any of the clusters assumed (Table S5; P &gt; 0.05). Bottleneck detection 

using the M-ratio method did, however, show that clusters have experienced demographic changes in 

time. Although the performance of the method is dependent on initial assumptions and settings, the 

more conservative approach recommended by Garza and Williamson (2001) indicated a recent 

reduction in population size, within the last few hundred generations, for both Azores and Madeira plus 

Canaries clusters (Fig. S5). In such case M-ratios for individual clusters fell under the lower 5% of the 

distribution of simulated M-values. Setting the average size of non one-step mutations to 2.8, which is 

the mean value for this parameter in the literature (see Garza and Williamson 2001), increased the 

detection of bottlenecks at higher values of the pre-bottleneck ? (Fig. S5). Estimates of contemporary 

migration rates calculated with BAYESASS showed no signs of gene flow between clusters (Table 

S6). Results of bottleneck and migration analyses did not differ when using a reduced loci dataset, i.e. 

only loci with &amp;lt;20% proportion of null alleles. 

 

4. Discussion 

Even though a high dispersal potential is expected in P. aspera as drawn from the pelagic larval 

duration of its congeneric European continental form P. ulyssiponensis, which is estimated to range 

between 14.5 - 27 days (average age of planktonic life in vitro after metamorphic competence; see 

Ribeiro 2008), unfavourable oceanographic conditions, large larvae mortality and the relatively large 

geographical distance among populations may have prompted the isolation between Azores and those 

on the remainder of the Macaronesia archipelagos. In fact, larval transport may be strongly affected by 

local eddies, current reversals and other unknown oceanographic physical patterns (Sponaugle et al. 

2002; Palumbi 2004). Moreover, marine larvae often face a huge mortality over relatively short 

distances from their spawning locations (e.g. Cowen et al. 2000). Larvae biological traits (e.g. growth, 

swimming and orientation capacities, reproductive and recruitment strategies) and species interactions 

(e.g. predation, food availability) may also determine a limited connectivity within a given species 

(Cowen and Sponaugle 2009). In fact, genetic breaks in marine invertebrates with high putative 

dispersal capacity are not uncommon in the literature (see Galarza et al. 2009; Serrano et al. 2014; 

Ouagajjou and Presa 2015; Guiñez et al. 2016). The relatively fragile nature of patellid larvae (when 

compared, for instance, with crustacean larvae), the realized larval pelagic duration which is 

presumably shorter in the field (e.g. Olson and McPherson 1987) and the predominately oligotrophic 

character of NE Atlantic waters surrounding the Macaronesia archipelagos (Marañon et al. 2000; Silva 

et al. 2013), may act to favour local retention and limit the dispersal capacity of P. aspera over large 

distances. Thus, genetic differentiation in P. aspera probably arose from the historical and 

contemporary complex interplay of particular biological and physical processes that favoured isolation 

over population homogeneity. Nevertheless, the shortest distance between Madeira and Canaries and 

the presence of the Selvagens islands in between both archipelagos, are likely to facilitate larvae 

dispersal and population connectivity of P. aspera among those archipelagos.

High inbreeding coefficients were detected in all populations. Such large deviations from HWE and 

excess of homozygotes are often strongly linked to the occurrence of null alleles across loci, with most 

population genetic studies avoiding their use in analyses. However, deviations from HWE can also be 

biological meaningful, especially when such deviations occur at multiple loci, and may be explained by 

several nonexclusive factors such as inbreeding, selection against heterozygotes and the Wahlund 

effect (Dakin and Avise 2004; Allendorf and Luikart 2007). The individual inbreeding model 

implemented in INEST showed that, although null alleles have an undoubted role on heterozygote 

deficit and interpopulation differentiation, inbreeding appears as the most likely process underpinning 

the observed positive FIS values. Processes that lead to inbreeding in natural populations (e.g. non-

random mating) are often considered to be more effective and associated with small populations and 

would hardly affect marine populations with expected high census population sizes. However, 

stochastic factors acting upon the recruitment success and especially the anthropogenic influence on 

the population dynamics and demography can lead to an unbalanced genetic composition in 

widespread marine populations (see O’Leary et al. 2013; Aglieri et al. 2014). Such processes can 

result in unexpected levels of relatedness among individuals and therefore inbreeding rates higher 

than expected. Exploitation of P. aspera across Macaronesia not only has reduced its abundance, but 

also the mean size of individuals (see section below). Since P. aspera is a protandric hermaphrodite, 

therefore undergoing sex change from male into female as they grow, harvesting is strongly biased 

towards females. Such reduction in the number of females is believed to trigger non-random mating 

and the production of individuals which relatedness is higher than expected by chance. In such over-

harvested populations, the census size (N) can thus greatly differ from the effective population size 

(Ne), where the number of individuals that actively contributes for the next generation being rather 

small. In fact, a reduction in Ne would counter the mechanisms that promote random mating in P. 

aspera, such as high fecundity, external fertilization with broadcast spawning, and putative extensive 

larval dispersal. Moreover, the fact that harvesting is size selective towards the larger individuals may 

impose a strong selection among heritable characteristics within exploited populations (see Conover 

and Munch 2002). Noteworthy, recent research has revealed that the sex-ratio of P. aspera remained 

unchanged regardless the increasing fishing pressure, suggesting that males are compensating for 

the removal of larger females by undergoing sex change at smaller and presumably earlier sizes 

(Martins et al. 2017), a pattern that has also been observed in other patellid limpets (Borges et al. 

2016). Although this mechanism can buffer populations against changes in sex-ratio of the species, 

the fact that females became smaller than their historical size, would affect the amount of gametes 

released into the water, with obvious negative consequences for the reproductive output of P. aspera. 

Moreover, it is still undetermined how this compensatory mechanism is to affect the gametic fitness of 

such small-size females or its impact on larval viability and dispersal capacity. Under these 

circumstances, inbreeding can emerge from a large variation in individual reproductive success 

influenced by particular environmental, reproductive and behaviour factors, with only a few individual 

limpets reproducing and actively contributing to the genetic pool of the next generation (see 

Hedgecock 1994). Although inbreeding is suggested as the main driver for the observed excess of 

homozygotes in P. aspera populations, other alternative mechanisms such as extensive within-



	 94 

population genetic structure (i.e. the Wahlund effect), higher rates of molecular evolution and 

randomly induced differences in allele frequencies between sperm and eggs have also been proposed 

to explain deviations from HWE in free-spawning marine invertebrates (see Addison and Hart 2005). 

In fact, the occurrence of a Wahlund effect cannot be entirely discarded, as unrecognized temporal 

breeding subunits may occur inside sampled populations, resulting in large variations from HWE. 

Moreover, seasonal or inter-annual changes in currents might bring together larvae from locally 

differentiated sources, providing the baseline for genetic patchiness and spatial substructuring of 

within-population demes. Yet, a Wahlund effect is less likely in our study, since each local geographic 

sample was tested separately and Bayesian clustering analyses did not detect any within-sample 

structuring, or within archipelago for that matter (i.e. Azores). Preliminary analyses for within-island 

genetic variation (two sampled locations within each island) also showed the absence of any 

population structuring at such smaller spatial scale. Furthermore, the impact of the Wahlund effect is 

usually more substantial when cryptic populations, recipient and donor, exhibit large differences in 

gene diversity (Zhivotovsky 2015); in this case, independently of distance, all P. aspera populations 

are relatively genetic impoverished with similar diversity, have individuals with alike morphological 

traits and there are no apparent differentiated niches where putative cohorts could genetically thrive 

distinctively. For instance, Côrte-Real et al. (1992) found no genetic differences between intertidal and 

subtidal specimens of P. aspera in the Azores. More importantly, although homozygote excess was 

shown to be surprisingly common in free-spawning species (see Addison and Hart 2005), deviations 

to HWE should be, above all, interpreted under the life-cycle particularities and circumstances of a 

given species. As so, given the acceptable sample size and number of microsatellite markers used in 

this study, the genome-wide effect detected (i.e. significant heterozygote deficits across all loci 

screened in all populations studied), the specificities of P. aspera reproductive/ breeding cycle and the 

unbalanced nature of harvesting, inbreeding seems the most plausible mechanism for the observed 

excess of homozygotes in P. aspera populations from Macaronesia. The retention of planktonic larvae 

near parent habitats, which is not uncommon even in species with very high dispersal potential (e.g. 

Swearer et al. 1999), may further support the idea that there are no high levels of immigration from 

other sites that otherwise would reduce the chances of inbreeding. A deeper insight into the spatial 

genetic structure of P. aspera populations would be possible by taking the so-called ‘seascape 

genetics’ approach, and use oceanographic modelling (e.g. Galindo et al. 2006) as well as many other 

interacting forces and traits to understand the processes involved in marine connectivity of the species 

(see review by Selkoe et al. 2016) 

Studies that include the effect of overexploitation or a reduction in the effective population size on the 

genetic diversity and inbreeding phenomena of marine invertebrates are fairly scarce (e.g. Gallardo et 

al. 1998; Constantini et al. 2007), and examples are often provided for other organisms such as fishes 

(e.g. Hutchinson et al. 2003; Hoarau et al. 2005; O’Leary et al. 2013). The generalized idea is that 

inbreeding, although occurring naturally in many populations, is intensified by overexploitation 

reducing the capability for adaptation and increasing the extinction risk (Keller and Waller 2002; 

Frankham 2005). Under these circumstances, exploited populations will tend to suffer to a greater 

extent from demographic and genetic stochasticity and face higher chances of extinction due to 



	 95 

inbreeding or loss of genetic diversity by drift (Frankham et al. 2014). Population subdivision can also 

foster inbreeding by decreasing migrants among subpopulations and prompting chances for mating 

among relatives (Bierne et al. 1998; Andrade and Solferini 2007). In such case, and even assuming 

random mating, inbreeding could occur because population sizes are very limited and the 

consequences of genetic drift become apparent (Keller and Waller 2002). In fact, population 

differentiation in P. aspera given by pairwise distances estimates (FST and Dest) indicated some degree 

of subdivision among islands (see Table 2). These estimates, however, may be unreliable, and 

interpretation should be cautious due to the known impact of null alleles in overestimating population 

differentiation. With much greater support, our findings suggested that i) Azores samples comprise an 

isolated population and ii) Madeira and Canaries populations cluster together in a single group. 

Moreover, insular populations of P. aspera are thought to have been isolated from continental forms 

for the last 4 - 8 Ma (Sá-Pinto et al. 2005; 2008). These same studies, using mtDNA analyses, 

revealed genetic differentiation between Azores and the remaining archipelagos. Given the high level 

of isolation and the similarity in environmental conditions among archipelagos, genetic diversity is not 

expected to be high. Whereas genetic diversity, under these circumstances, can be lost purely due to 

genetic drift, the prolonged and long-time harvesting of limpets across archipelagos is likely to have 

negatively impacted genetic diversity and favoured inbreeding due to a reduction in the effective 

population size in P. aspera.  Unfortunately, there are no current estimates of P. aspera effective 

population sizes throughout the region. Yet, considering the historical and more recent Catch Per Unit 

Effort (CPUE) as a reliable proxy of population census sizes in P. aspera, i.e. in the early 1990’s there 

were still places in Azores where CPUE was around 12 kg / half hour but this has fallen to 5 g / half 

hour in recent years (OSPAR-Commission (2010), it is clear that a dramatic reduction in the 

abundance of animals has taken place, which is likely to have negatively affected the present-day Ne 

in P. aspera across the region. 

 

4.1. Implications for the management and conservation 

Harvesting of P. aspera, which is currently listed in the OSPAR list of threatened and/or declining 

species and habitats (OSPAR-Commission 2010), is under specific legislation throughout the 

Macaronesia region. At each archipelago, seasonal fishing closures and minimum catch sizes have 

been imposed: Azores (October - April, 50 mm); Madeira (December-March, 40 mm); and Canaries 

(December - April, 45 mm). Moreover, harvesting is forbidden inside specific marine protected areas 

and/or limpet protection zones in each archipelago. Catch limits (kg) per day for commercial (with 

permit only) and recreational use have also been established. Seasonal closures have broadly been 

defined in agreement with reproductive periods occurring during colder months (see Vale 2016). 

Despite this, non-compliance with current legislation is the norm among limpet harvesters (see Diogo 

et al. 2016). Empirical evidence suggests that P. aspera stocks are pretty much depleted and 

overexploited (Martins et al. 2008; 2011) and the lack of enforcement of regulations is seen as the 

most likely reason for the failure to protect limpet populations. To raise awareness, regional authorities 

should promote environmental education actions directed to fishermen and general public, for the 



	 96 

importance of the sustainable use of limpets as a resource as well as a key ecological asset. Limpet 

protection zones, which have been shown to be largely ineffective (see Martins et al. 2011; Diogo et 

al. 2016), would likely work if permanently monitored and surveyed by local authorities. Management 

approaches should also target intermediate-sized individuals by establishing an upper size limit on 

limpets (Conover and Munch 2002; Allendorf et al. 2008). In the short term, this would increase the 

number of larger females potentially generating higher-quality offspring and contributing to an 

increasing effective population size in P. aspera (see Birkeland and Dayton 2005) and thus helping 

reducing inbreeding rates. From a stock perspective, and considering the population differentiation 

found among the Azorean and other archipelagos’ populations, both Madeira and Canaries authorities 

should join efforts in establishing a common management strategy for the protection and harvesting of 

P. aspera in those archipelagos. Moreover, the high levels of isolation and exploitation of the Azorean 

populations suggests that authorities must act immediately to avoid the genetic and demographic 

depletion of P. aspera stocks in the Azores. Scientifically sound data on this limpet reproductive cycle, 

its recruitment rate and its demographic status would help inform conservation actions and formal 

stock definition. Although genetic approaches are only a small piece in the intricate puzzle of defining 

effective fishery stocks, this study suggests that limpet conservation and fisheries management across 

Macaronesia should, at the very least, consider two independent stocks: one in Azores and another 

one in Madeira - Canaries. Management and conservation initiatives need to be revisited in the light of 

such results. Above all, the most direct way to reduce the effects of over-exploitation on P. aspera 

across the Macaronesian region is to drastically reduce the intensity of harvest of its populations.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 

 

Methods 

 

2.1. Sampling and laboratory procedures  

Briefly, 17 microsatellite markers were amplified in three multiplex PCR reactions containing 5 – 6 loci 

using the Qiagen® PCR multiplexing kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 

Amplifications took place on a MyCyclerTM thermal cycler (BioRad) using a touchdown protocol and a 

final volume of 10 ?L with approximately 10 ng DNA template, 1 × QiagenTM Multiplex PCR Kit, 0.4 - 

1.2 ?M of each primer and ddH2O. The PCR routine for each multiplex reaction consisted of an initial 

denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min; 5 cycles of touchdown amplification (denaturation at 94°C for 30 

sec, annealing temperature (TA) (see Faria et al. 2015) for 1 min descending by 0.5°C intervals to the 

optimal TA, plus extension at 72°C for 40 sec; 22 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, optimal TA for 1 min, and 

extension at 72°C for 40 sec; 10 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 53°C for 50 sec, 72°C for 45 sec; and a 

final extension step at 60°C for 30 min. Approximately 20% of the samples were re-run to ensure 

repeatability in scoring. Amplified fragments were visualized using an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) 

automated DNA sequencer with GeneScanTM 500Liz (Applied Biosystems) as an internal size 

standard for accurate sizing. Genotypes were called using GENEMAPPERTM v.4.2 (Applied 

Biosystems).  

 

2.2. Genetic diversity  

LOSITAN (Antao et al. 2008): LOSITAN applies the FST outlier detection approach to identify loci 

potentially under selection. In order to avoid potential bias when assigning FST as outlier due to 

random drift and historical events affecting gene flow, the two more geographically distant populations 

(Madeira and Gran Canaria) were removed from analysis.  

 

2.3. Population structure  

POWSIM v.4.0 (Ryman and Palm 2006):? Simulations were carried out considering combinations of 

several effective population sizes (Ne) and number of generations (t). Observed allele frequencies 

were used as a starting point. In all cases, 1 000 replicates were run and the power of the analysis 

was indicated by the proportion of tests that were significant at P &amp;lt;0.05 based on chi-square and 

Fisher’s exact tests.  

STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 2000): STRUCTURE, which allows determining the most 

plausible K number of genetically homogeneous groups in the dataset. The analyses were run with 

105 burn-in iterations followed by 5 × 105 Markov chain Monte Carlo steps, applying an admixture 

ancestry model with correlated allele frequencies and prior sampling location information (LOCPRIOR 



	 105 

= 1). Considering the origin of individuals as prior information is more powerful in detecting weak 

genetic structure, reduces mis-assignments and increases the sensibility of STRUCTURE in clustering 

populations with low genetic divergence (Hubisz et al. 2009).  

GENELAND (Guillot et al. 2005):? GENELAND which can account for the presence of null alleles 

while incorporating geographical coordinates information for genotyped individuals to estimate the 

most likely number of clusters and their spatial boundaries. Given the prior knowledge regarding 

dispersal and potential barriers to gene flow in P. aspera, preference was given to the spatial model 

with null alleles. Even so, distinct model conditions were also tested. To improve the detection of 

subtle genetic structure (Guillot 2008), all models assumed correlated allele frequencies. For each 

model, three independent MCMC runs were conducted, each consisting of 2 × 107 iterations with a 

thinning of 1 000 after a burn-in of 2 × 103. Consistency between runs was assessed by checking that 

they provided approximately the same parameter estimates (K, individual population membership, 

maps). The highest average posterior probability was used as a criterion to select the best run under 

the given set of model conditions.  

 

2.5. Bottleneck detection and gene flow  

BOTTLENECK v.1.2.02 (Cornuet and Luikart, 1996):? Because microsatellites rarely conform strictly 

to the infinite allele mutation (IAM) model or the stepwise-mutation model (SMM), the two-phase 

model (TPM) accommodating both mutation types was adopted (Di Rienzo et al. 1994; Piry et al. 

1999). TPM was parameterized with 78% and 90% single-step mutations, assuming a conservative 

variance among multiple steps of 12 as recommended for microsatellites (Piry et al. 1999, Peery et al. 

2012). The significance of the heterozygosity excess was assessed using the one-tail Wilcoxon sign-

rank test with 10 000 iterations. Each analysis was independently carried out for each inferred genetic 

cluster provided by STRUCTURE and GENELAND (see Results).  

M_p_val (Garza and Williamson 2001):? This analysis is considered to be more appropriate to detect 

genetic bottlenecks that occurred over relatively long periods of time (&gt; 100 generations). The M-ratio 

test is based on the ratio of the number of alleles over the range in allele size and it can identify gaps 

in the allele size frequency distribution resulting from loss of alleles due to bottleneck events. Loci with 

odd-sized alleles (those that did not represent multiples of the recognized repeat unit) were omitted 

from analyses. Three parameters are required by the method: the pre-bottleneck value of ? = 4Nemu 

(where Ne is the effective pre-bottleneck population size at equilibrium and mu is the mutation rate), 

the fraction of mutations that are larger than single steps (ps) and the average size of non-single-step 

mutations (?g). Because such information is not available for P. aspera in particular, a broad range of 

input parameters were tested, including Garza and Williamson (2001) findings and recommendations 

(see Results). A range of values of ? from 0.1 to 200 (corresponding to Ne values of 50 - 100 000) 

were tested to determine the sensitivity of M to changes in such parameter and assuming an average 

mutation rate of 5 × 10-4. The observed M-ratio for each cluster was then compared to the critical 

value obtained in CRITICAL_M and estimated through 10 000 simulations with the same parameters 

as the data and assuming the population to be at drift–migration equilibrium. Lower M-ratios than 



	 106 

populations at equilibrium is taken as evidence that the sample is from a population that had 

experienced a recent bottleneck (Garza and Williamson 2001).  

BAYESASS v.3.0 (Wilson and Rannala 2003):? Ten MCMC runs with different initial seeds using 106 

burn-in, following by 3 × 106 sampling iterations were carried out in order to maximize convergence 

and mixing. Mixing parameters were adjusted to achieve acceptance rates of 20 - 40%. The Bayesian 

deviance was used as an optimality criterion to find the run with the best fit (Faubet et al. 2007). 

Deviance was calculated from the trace file using the R-script provided by Meirmans (2014).

CHAPTER 6 

Spatial and temporal patterns in recruitment in the exploited limpet Patella 
candei 

 

 

ABSTRACT  

The rate of input of new individuals is a key driver of population dynamics. When considering marine 

exploited species population persistence is a fine balance between individuals that are removed by 

harvesting and individuals that are added to the population via recruitment. A spatially and temporally 

replicated monitoring programme was put in place during 2014-2015 to assess the levels of 

recruitment of the exploited limpet Patella candei (d'Orbigny 1839) in the Azores (NE Atlantic). 

Recruitment occurred throughout both years but its intensity varied in space and time. The mean 

number of recruits per m2 in 2014 and 2015 was 26.3 (±1.7 SE) and 11.3 (±0.9 SE), respectively. In 

general, a marked peak in recruitment occurred during winter/spring months, the period of greatest 

reproductive activity, when sea surface temperatures were lower and wave turbulence higher. There 

was a significant correlation between sea surface temperature (SST), significant wave height (HS), 

wave period (TZ) and wave direction (WDIR) and limpet recruitment. While each of these environmental 

variables may have individually influenced reproduction and recruitment, significant wave height (HS) 

was probably the most important proximate factor triggering the recruitment of P. candei. This single 

variable accounted for the observed inter-annual variation in recruitment levels. The understanding of 

how such environmental processes are coupled with larval recruitment dynamics is a key aspect in 

fisheries science, and may help to improve conservation strategies aimed at achieving a sustainable 

use of exploited marine resources.

1. Introduction 

Recruitment, which is broadly regarded as the addition of new individuals to populations, is considered 

a critical step for marine organisms to thrive (Caley et al. 1996; Palumbi and Pinsky 2014). Many of 

these organisms are sessile or sedentary as adults; therefore their persistence is largely or exclusively 

dependent on the addition of new juveniles to the population. If this compensatory mechanism is 

somehow reduced, then populations will be particularly vulnerable to over-harvesting or other 

perturbations (Fogarty et al. 1991). Conversely, impacts on marine adult populations (e.g. over-

exploitation) can negatively impact their reproductive output, fertilization success and hence 

subsequent recruitment (e.g. Kelly et al. 2009). Local production of offspring may, however, have little 

to no direct effect in determining population size, providing that connectivity allows replenishing of 

populations by the addition of individuals produced elsewhere (Underwood and Fairweather 1989; 

Caley et al. 1996). 

In most marine benthic invertebrate species, reproduction occurs through the release of eggs or 

gamete into the water and by developing a planktonic larval stage that can potentially disperse tens to 

hundreds of kilometers in the water column before settling into suitable habitats. The development, 

survival and settlement of these early-life stages are dependent on the combined forces of several 

physical and biological factors, such as temperature (e.g. Han 2011; Rankin and Sponaugle 2011), 

wave action (e.g. Jenkins et al. 1997), light conditions (Tatsumi and Wright 2016), food availability 

(e.g. Castonguay et al. 2008), competition (e.g. Hixon and Jones 2005) and predation (e.g. Doherty et 

al. 2004). Moreover, many larvae exhibit selective settlement (e.g. Knight-Jones 1953; Crisp 1974; 

Jenkins 2005), mediated by physiological and behavioural responses to physical or chemical cues 

broadly associated with adult presence at suitable sites (e.g. Crisp 1967; Crisp and Meadows 1962; 

Miron et al. 1996; Kay 2002; Cahill and Koury 2016), or by habitat complexity (e.g. Underwood 2004; 

Bohn et al. 2013) or biofilms (Thompson et al. 1998). The challenges associated with the addition of 

new individuals via pelagic larvae to sessile and often patchy adult populations are immense and 

critical for the persistence and dynamics of marine benthic species. Larval stages are thus the most 

sensitive stage in the life cycle of many marine benthic organisms. Furthermore, post-settlement 

processes involving complex interactions between predators (Keough and Downes 1982; Doherty et 

al. 2004), competitors (e.g. Denley and Underwood 1979; Underwood et al. 1983), shelter (Butler and 

Herrnkind 1997) and food availability, and physical disturbances (Lewis and Bowman 1975) can have 

a major influence on recruitment success (see review by Hunt and Scheibling 1997). Understanding 

the scale at which physical and biological processes are coupled with larval recruitment has a crucial 

importance in identifying temporal abundance patterns of adult populations, their distribution and 

resilience to disturbances. This information can then be used in implementing marine ecosystem 

management and conservation approaches to marine stocks facing continuous exploitation. 

The limpet Patella candei (d'Orbigny 1840) is a marine gastropod mollusc that commonly occurs at 

mid to high intertidal levels on rocky shores across the Macaronesia archipelagos (NE Atlantic) with 

the exception of Cape Verde. As a broadcast spawner, P. candei releases gametes into the water 

column, and upon fertilization, they go thorough a planktonic larval stage wherein a trochophore larvae 



	 119 

develops to a pre and post-torsional veliger, before settling on hard substrate and metamorphosing. 

As in other patellids, the pelagic larval duration is assumed to last between a few days and few weeks, 

depending on water temperature (Hawkins et al. 2000; Ribeiro et al. 2009). The success of fertilization 

is dependent of a number of variables (e.g. sperm concentration, gamete age and contact time) but 

these are not likely to significantly affect dispersal, which is mostly a function of the duration of the 

planktonic larvae in the water column (Hodgson et al. 2007). According to Martins et al. (1987), P. 

candei shows no marked peak of spawning and resting period throughout the year. Yet, more recent 

studies have confirmed that P. candei is in fact primarily a winter breeder (see Henriques et al. 2012; 

Vale 2016), with a greater proportion of individuals reaching the spawning stage (see gonad ripening 

stages in Orton et al. 1956) between late-autumn and spring months, with a resting season in the 

summer. In Patella vulgata (Linnaeus 1758), winter breeding is generally assumed to be associated 

with a decrease in temperature (Bowman and Lewis 1977) and/or to more turbulent water conditions 

(Blackmore 1969). Whereas temperature can play a vital role in reproductive phenology and early 

larval growth-related traits, wave action is considered to trigger spawning and facilitate the release and 

transport of gametes in Patella (mainly studies on P. vulgata: Orton et al. 1956; Bowman and Lewis 

1977, 1986; Thompson 1979; Moore et al. 2011).  

The fate of P. candei larvae in their natural environment is largely unknown. Despite living in a pelagic 

environment structured by physical processes, which may limit the species capacity to disperse, 

patellid larvae are offered a vast range of opportunities that may help them find a suitable settlement 

site. Recent evidence from in-vitro fertilization trials showed that P. candei larvae are planktotrophic 

and can feed on diatoms (see Chapter 7). Planktotrophic larvae have the potential to disperse longer 

distances (Scheltema 1986). Moreover, patellid trochophore and veliger larvae are active swimmers, 

showing bursts of fast upward/horizontal swimming and passive sinking (Ribeiro 2008), which may 

allow them to position in the water column in areas where food is available and/or currents are 

favourable. Such conspicuous behaviour exposes larvae to different flow regimes, which is likely to 

affect and determine their growth, mortality and dispersal (e.g. Fiksen et al. 2007). Patellid larvae also 

show chemotaxic behaviour upon substratum selection (Ribeiro 2008). This allows individuals to find 

the most suitable habitat, providing higher chances of survival and post-settlement performance (Elkin 

and Marshall 2007). For instance, the presence of crustose coralline algae is known to induce 

substratum-specific settlement, attachment and metamorphosis in several marine gastropods 

including abalones (Morse et al. 1984; Barlow 1990; Roberts and Nicholson 1997) and limpets 

(McGrath and Foley 2005; Ribeiro 2008). The exact cues for such site selection are still poorly 

understood. 

Patellid larvae may also be challenged in finding suitable space to settle on rocky shores. Long-term 

exploitation of limpets in the Azores (Martins et al. 2008a) has resulted in most of the space at mid-

shore levels being dominated by algal turfs, which preclude the settlement of limpets (Martins et al. 

2010). This has also been shown elsewhere (see Underwood et al. 1983; Boaventura et al. 2002). 

Very little information is available on recruitment of P. candei, and most of it comes from anecdotal 

evidence derived from field observations or extrapolations made from adult gonad maturation periods 



	 120 

(Vale 2016) and length–frequency observations (Henriques et al. 2012). This study is aimed at 

quantifying the temporal and spatial variation in recruitment of P. candei on the south coast of São 

Miguel Island, Azores, and establish possible relationships between real-time environmental data such 

as sea surface temperatures and wave action, and limpet recruitment. This information is not only 

crucial for understanding the population dynamics of exploited stocks of P. candei, but also to assess 

the role of physical/environmental processes in recruitment variability.  

 

2. Methods 

2.1. Study sites and communities 

This study was conducted on two consecutive years (2014 - 2015) across stretches of 20 m in four 

locations of the São Miguel Island, Azores (Fig. 1). All locations are of volcanic origin (basalt sensu 

lato) and moderately exposed to southerly wave action, and consist of small rocky platforms that 

support similar assemblages of animals and plants. The lower shore is mostly dominated by coarsely 

branched algae (e.g. articulated coralline algae, Gelidium spp. and Caulacanthus ustulatus), whilst the 

barnacle Chthamalus stellatus dominates on the upper shore. Ephemeral algae such as Ulva spp. and 

Chaetomorpha spp. can be seasonally abundant and scattered clumps of the brown algae Fucus 

spiralis are also observed at mid-shore levels. Common fauna include the periwinkles Tectarius 

striatus and Melarhaphe neritoides, and the patellid species P. candei, which are the most abundant 

littoral grazers (Hawkins et al. 1990, Martins et al. 2008b).

	 121 

2.2. Sampling design 

A total of 15 basaltic plates (7 × 7 cm) mimicking the natural coastal substrate, were initially placed at 

the mid-shore level in the transition between algal turfs and barnacles at each location, where P. 

candei abundance is highest (Martins et al. 2010). These plates were collected monthly during spring 

low tides and replaced by new ones. Quantification of P. candei recruits on plates was done under an 

optical microscope. Individuals with 0.5 cm or less (total shell length) were considered as recruits (or 

recently recruited) as in Martins et al. (2010) (Fig. S1). As in other patellids (e.g. Hartnoll and Wright 

1977), P. candei also exhibits a homing behaviour (E. Cacabelos, unpublished data 2014), where 

individuals upon recruiting in a small rock depression/ hole/ crevice to which the shell margin 

conforms, tend to return to the same area after foraging excursions. Such homing behaviour on top of 

our size-based definition of recruits ensures that the number of smaller-sized animals observed on a 

given plate are likely a surrogate of recent settlement leading to recruitment in that particular month. 

Environmental data were obtained from a moored buoy located on the south coast of São Miguel 

island, Azores (37º 43.546' N / 25º 43.284') which is run under the projects CLIMAAT - MAC 2.3/A.3, 

CLIMAAT II - 03/MAC/2.3/A.5 and CLIMARCOST – 05/MAC/2.3/A1. Sea surface temperature (SST), 

significant wave height (HS), wave period (TZ) and wave direction (WDIR: degrees north from which the 

waves are traveling) were recorded at time intervals of 10 secs during the course of this study. Due to 

missing data (owing to buoy malfunction during part of the experimental period), SST estimates were 

also obtained from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Multi-Scale High Resolution SST (MUR SST), 

which merges data from infrared and passive microwave datasets collected from satellites into global 

daily maps gridded at 1 km resolution, generating a product that contains no cloud contamination (see 

Chin et al. 1998; more information can be found at http://mur.jpl.nasa.gov/). SST data were extracted 

on a weekly basis around a 2 km buffer of the sampling locations. Monthly time series were 

reconstructed for all environmental variables. 

 

2.3. Data analysis 

Spatial and temporal differences in limpet recruitment were examined using a 3-way analysis of 

variance (ANOVA) with the following factors: ‘year’ (fixed factor, 2 levels), ‘month’ (random factor and 

nested within year, 12 levels) and ‘location’ (random factor and orthogonal to other factors, 4 levels) 

with 15 replicates. Temporal variation in environmental variables was analysed by means of a 2-way 

ANOVA following the same general design but without the factor ‘location’. 

Given that recruitment of P. candei showed a clear peak during early months in each year (see section 

below), analyses were also run using a subset of months corresponding to this specific period and 

thus avoiding the influence of an excessive number of zeros in the analyses. This recruitment period 

was defined as the broadest time interval where monthly recruitment averages were greater than the 

yearly average, which corresponded, in this study, to the period between January and April. All tests 

were done using PERMANOVA+ based on Euclidean distances and using 999 permutations 

(Anderson et al. 2008). Prior to analyses, data were checked for heterogeneity of variances and 



	 122 

transformations were applied when needed (Underwood 1997). Analyses were performed on 

untransformed data when attempts to stabilize variances through transformation were unsuccessful. In 

such cases, because of the increased likelihood of Type I error, a more conservative significance level 

(? = 0.01) was used when testing for differences (Underwood 1997). 

The association between recruitment and each environmental variable was assessed in R v.3.3.0 (R 

Core Team 2014) using a correlation/ linear regression analysis. Due to high collinearity among 

environmental variables (see Quinn and Keough 2002), the distance-based linear models routine 

(DistLM, Anderson et al. 2008) was then used to examine how much of the variability in P. candei 

recruitment was accounted for by each of the environmental (predictor) variables measured by the 

buoy. Predictor variables were fitted individually in marginal tests to determine their relationship with 

recruitment and identify their relative contribution for the observed variation in recruitment. All DistLM 

analyses were based on Euclidean dissimilarities, and P-values for testing the null hypothesis of no 

relationship were obtained using 999 permutations.  

 

3. Results 

Although recruitment of P. candei was recorded throughout both years of survey, its intensity varied in 

space and time (Fig. 2; Table S1; Fig. S2). The mean number of recruits per m2 in 2014 and 2015 was 

26.3 (± 1.7 SE) and 11.3 (± 0.9 SE), respectively. A marked peak in recruitment occurred in 

winter/spring months, especially in 2014 when recruitment was substantially greater (Fig. 3). When 

considering only the period of highest recruitment (January to April), analyses showed a significant 

interaction between ‘year’ and ‘location’ (ANOVA, P &amp;lt;0.05; Table S2). Inspection of a posteriori tests 

showed that recruitment of P. candei was consistently higher in 2014 on all four locations examined 

(Fig. 4). During this period, the mean number of recruits per m2 in 2014 and 2015 was 57 (± 3.9 SE) 

and 17.1 (± 2.0 SE), respectively.

comparisons on term YEAR × LOCATION for pairs of levels of factor YEAR are significantly different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

 

There was a significant correlation between all the environmental variables and recruitment (Fig. S3). 

Whilst the relationship between recruitment and SSTs was negative, the relationship between 

recruitment and the remaining variables was positive (Fig. S3). The DistLM analysis showed that 

environmental variables, when considered separately, significantly predicted the recruitment of P. 

candei. However, marginal tests (Table 1) showed that HS was the best single predictor accounting for 

about 69% of the variation in recruitment, whilst WDIR, TZ and SSTBUOY explained a reduced proportion 

of recruitment (48%, 44% and 40% respectively). Moreover, significant variation between years for the 

environmental variables was only detected for wave height (ANOVA, P &amp;lt;0.05; Table S3), which was 

51.3 % higher in 2014 compared to 2015 (15.1% when considering only the same months in both 

years).

4. Discussion 

This study shows that P. candei recruitment, although occurring throughout the year, shows a peak 

during winter/spring months (January to April), following peak reproductive activity when sea surfaces 

temperatures are lowest and wave action is highest. A similar pattern was described for P. candei in 

Madeira Island, about 920 km southeast of Azores (see Henriques et al. 2012). While each of the four 

environmental variables investigated here may have influenced recruitment on its own, significant 



	 125 

wave height (HS) was probably the most important factor triggering the recruitment of P. candei. In 

fact, it was the only variable that effectively accounted for the observed inter-annual variation in 

recruitment: a roughly 40% decrease in limpet recruitment from 2014 to 2015. Wave action has been 

positively associated with release (Orton et al. 1956; Orton and Southward 1961; Shanks 1998) the 

transport and settlement of larvae on coastal shores (Jeffery and Underwood 2000) and it is 

considered a good proxy of nearshore larval transport. This relationship, however, is likely to follow a 

dome-shaped function (see Cury and Roy 1989), in which the capacity of larvae to settle and recruit 

may be limited by higher wave weights (Ortega 1981). Yet, as with any conclusions based on 

correlations, this strong relationship between recruitment variation and wave height can be caused by 

other covarying factors such as temperature, wind speeds, wind direction, water flow, tides, coastal 

upwellings and/or nutrient inputs. These and many other processes often interact together in 

determining recruitment variation at multiple spatial and temporal scales (see Pineda et al. 2007, 

2009). For instance, the spatial variation detected in P. candei recruitment likely reflects the intricate 

influence of several spatially structured nearshore processes operating at very localized spatial scales 

i.e. without ruling out stochastic events by themselves, features such as local geomorphology (Palma 

et al. 2006), substrate microtopography (Kohler et al. 1999) and local flow patterns (Archambault and 

Bourget 1999; Shanks et al. 2003) may interact in a complex way to determine if recruits are to occur 

or not in precise rocky shores areas, leading to unpredictable patterns of spatial variability in 

recruitment. Moreover, the spatial variability in recruitment may arise from processes that directly 

affect settlement and post-settlement mortality rates, such as the larval response to various abiotic 

and biotic cues on the substratum, including surface texture or chemistry, conspecifics, and the 

presence or absence of other macrobenthic species or microbial biofilms (see review in Hunt and 

Scheibling 1997). Interestingly, the trend in recruitment levels of P. candei, although variable between 

sites, showed a remarkable consistency between years (see Fig. 4). This highlights the significant 

importance of small spatial-scale processes in determining local coastal communities. 

The life-history strategy of P. candei seems to take advantage of wintertime conditions as a means to 

maximize reproduction, spawning, larval development, dispersal and survival. But the magnitude and 

interplay of conditions that affect the outcome of any one of these phases can be considerably 

different. For instance, temperature is known to be an ultimate driver for phenology and reproductive 

traits such as maturing and the development of ripe-stage gonads in limpets, while storms and wave 

action are often seen as proximate cues to spawning events (Orton et al. 1956; Bowman and Lewis 

1977; Moore et al. 2011). The variable nature of such processes will ultimately play a determinant role 

in shaping recruitment variability patterns in space and time. For instance, as homologous 

temperatures did not differ between years, the most likely cause for recruitment failure in 2015 in P. 

candei may be associated to inadequate conditions of processes that usually work as proximate cues 

to spawning and/or recruitment, such has storms and wave action. 

As winter brooders, the temperatures recorded during winter/spring months are probably within the 

range for optimal phenology, larval development and early recruit growth in P. candei. Also, within the 

North Atlantic subtropical province, where Azores is included, wintertime mixing provides the seasonal 

replenishment of nutrients to the euphotic zone while in spring, thermal stratification favours 



	 126 

phytoplankton growth, which progressively leads to surface nutrient depletion by late summer (Silva et 

al. 2013). Assuming that the phytoplankton is the primary food source for P. candei larvae, the most 

beneficial timing for reproduction and recruitment would be prior or overlaid to the period of highest 

food abundance, providing that there is a positive balance between food gains and predatory and 

competition losses. Moreover, the life-history strategy of P. candei allows the species to avoid the time 

of the year when coastal thermal stress is higher and wave action is weaker, preventing mortality of 

early recruits from desiccation or overheating conditions to which the early stages of many marine 

invertebrates are susceptible (e.g. Kordas et al. 2015). 

Due to the geographical isolation of the Azores, recruitment is restricted to the local production of 

offspring and/or dispersal from more distant populations within the archipelago (Faria et al. 2017). 

Identifying the exact source of recruits remains a great challenge for marine ecologists, especially 

because of the difficulties in tracking such small size individuals through the dynamic nature of the 

pelagic environment (Swearer et al. 2002). Nevertheless, a growing number of studies indicate that 

self-recruitment is a common process in many benthic marine species (e.g. Jones et al. 1999; 

Kingsford et al. 2002; Teske et al. 2016), providing selective advantages over long-distance dispersal 

(see Strathmann et al. 2002). In fact, for many marine species, larval behaviour and nearshore 

hydrodynamic processes may promote the retention of planktonic larvae close to parental habitats. In 

such cases, the ability of larvae to recruit back to their natal populations may offer them a more 

effective opportunity of finding suitable habitats and minimize the risk of predation (Swearer et al. 

2002). Despite this, there is no solid indication that self-recruitment is the main process acting upon P. 

candei populations. Whether this might be the case, several aspects of the life history of P. candei 

seem to support a more open population model, with larvae dispersing over long distances and 

settling far from their parents’ area, on occasional fast recruitment events during storms. First, feeding 

larvae have the potential to support a relatively long pelagic duration and, despite their swimming 

capacity, P. candei larvae are quite small and likely act as passive particles that can be easily 

transported by currents to more remote locations far from their origin i.e. between close-by islands in 

Azores. Secondly, most P. candei gametes are released into the water column during wintertime (Vale 

2016), under stronger turbulent waters, which promote mixing, fertilization and initial transport away 

from parental areas. Moreover, in São Miguel island, local recruitment does not seem to be strictly 

correlated with local production i.e. November has the highest percentage of ripe individuals (Vale 

2016) and recruitment tends to peak between January and April. As mentioned above, this temporal 

mismatch can probably be a consequence of specific environmental requirements needed to trigger 

reproduction and recruitment, and does not necessarily mean that recruits are originating from 

elsewhere; ripe gonads do occur throughout the winter/spring season and given the appropriate cues 

for spawning (Vale 2016), recruitment can still be generated locally. 

Another aspect to note is derived from stock-recruitment relationships. For instance, Martins et al. 

(2008a) showed that the number of islanders per coastal perimeter is a good predictor of the 

abundance of P. candei across the Azorean archipelago, and that the number of larger animals 

decrease with increasing island population. Being the most populated island, São Miguel has 

presumably the lowest number of larger individuals of P. candei per coastal perimeter, considerably 



	 127 

limiting the reproductive capacity and offspring production of the species on the island. Therefore, a 

likely source of P. candei recruits in São Miguel could be from close-by populations from different 

islands of the archipelago (i.e. Santa Maria, Formigas). As long as recruitment continues, these highly 

exploited populations will persist even if local production is limited. Although the implications of genetic 

connectivity and demographic connectivity can be substantially different (see Lowe and Allendorf 

2010), the homogeneous gene pool detected throughout the archipelago (Faria et al. 2017) may 

further support this open population model, where connectivity between limpet populations in different 

islands is maintained via exchange of pelagic larvae.  

Although many physical and biological processes are known to play a pivotal role in the development 

and survival of larval stages, settlers and early recruits in marine invertebrates, the direct effect of 

each process is hardly identifiable. Despite the challenges, understanding how these processes are 

coupled with larval recruitment has crucial importance to implement marine ecosystem management 

and conservation initiatives. Moreover, the prediction of recruitment fluctuations, especially 

considering the environmental changes that are expected under a rapid climate change scenario (i.e. 

warmer oceans, extreme weather events; IPCC 2014) is a fundamental aspect to consider in 

assessing metapopulation dynamics and resilience in exploited marine organisms.

CHAPTER 7 

Larval development of the limpet Patella candei at varying water temperatures: 
implications under global warming 

 

 

ABSTRACT  

Temperature can have profound effects on larval growth rates, which in turn impact pelagic larval 

duration of many free-spawning marine invertebrates. Under predictive scenarios of global warming it 

is important to understand the likely changes in distribution, dispersal ability and population structure 

of marine species, especially those that are commercially exploited. Here, the effect of water 

temperature on larval development of Patella candei (d’Orbigny 1840) from Azores (NE Atlantic) was 

examined under controlled laboratory conditions. Three temperatures that are usually experienced in 

the waters surrounding the archipelago throughout the year were used (14ºC, 18ºC and 22ºC). Both 

the duration of larval development and larval survivorship were significantly affected by temperature. 

Larval development was faster at increasing temperatures and cumulative survivorship decreased; 

about 25% of larvae at 22ºC survived to the end of the experiment, a 2-fold decrease from the 

average survivorship of ~ 50% at 14ºC. As sea surface temperatures continue to rise, embryos and 

larvae of P. candei will be subject to a deleterious effect, probably reducing the dispersal capacity and 

the recovery potential of exploited populations of P. candei throughout the region. Experimental trials 

on larval development provide valuable information that may be used to refine current and future 

transport models for geographically-isolated, exploited limpets such as P. candei under changing 

environmental conditions, helping to adjust conservation and resource-management actions aimed at 

protecting such important and endemic resources.

1. Introduction 

Wide-ranging evidence shows that ocean warming has been taking place for the last decades (IPCC 

2014) and current trends emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of 

effects on global marine species and communities. The energetic metabolism of living organisms is 

largely dependent on temperature (Brown et al. 2004), being affected by both unfavourably high and 

unfavourably low temperatures. Thus ocean warming is likely to affect the development, growth and 

metabolic traits of individuals, thereby, influencing the distribution, abundance, population dynamics 

and reproductive timing of species (see reviews in Helmuth et al. 2006; Byrne 2011). This will 

inevitably lead to changes in the functioning of many marine ecosystems, with some species probably 

facing extinction while others will thrive (see Hawkins et al. 2009; Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno 2010). 

In particular, early life-stages of free-spawning marine invertebrates can be especially vulnerable to 

climatic fluctuations and strongly influencing subsequent life-history stages (Gosselin and Qian 1996, 

1997). In fact, larvae represent a physiological bottleneck, as they are generally more sensitive to 

thermal, nutritional and other environmental stresses than their conspecific adults (Anger 2001). For 

instance, numerous studies on the pace of developmental constraints, swimming performance, 

physiology and planktonic larval duration (PLD) have showed that temperature acts as a major 

environmental factor controlling invertebrate development (e.g. Anger et al. 2003; Bassim and 

Sammarco 2003; Green and Fisher 2004; Brennand et al. 2010; Arnberg et al. 2013; David and Simon 

2014). Although the response of experimentally-reared marine invertebrate embryos and larvae under 

distinct temperature regimes varied between species and studies (Negri et al. 2007; Byrne 2012), 

increasing temperature has a generalised pervasive stimulatory effect on metabolism until lethal levels 

are reached (see Supporting information in O’Connor et al. 2007). This has important consequences 

for a range of ecological attributes including larval dispersal, population connectivity, local adaptation, 

and speciation in marine biota. Given that the duration of the larval period is known to influence larval 

dispersal distance and survival, which in turn are positively correlated with population connectivity 

(Bohonak 1999), genetic structure is likely to be higher in warmer waters, or can increase under the 

predicted scenario of ocean warming. In fact, a positive correlation between latitude and connectivity 

among species has been previously detected in polyplacophoran molluscs, with species at lower 

latitudes generally having more isolated (hence structured) populations (e.g. Kelly and Eernisse 2007). 

This pattern is probably driven by faster larval development in warmer waters reducing the duration of 

the dispersive pelagic stage and consequently the connectivity among populations, by limiting the 

dispersal potential of the species. Although such observations may not be extended to all living taxa, 

as many other factors can be involved, understanding the way temperature influences the 

development of early live-stages can provide valuable information to more realistic biophysical models 

of dispersal of free-spawning marine invertebrates (e.g. Paris et al. 2013). The ability to assess the 

degree of demographic connectivity over ecological and evolutionary time frames, through the 

identification of putative barriers to dispersal and range limitations, will definitely aid the re-shaping of 

present-day marine reserves, while fostering better management strategies under expected scenarios 

of climatic changes.

The endemic limpet Patella candei (d’Orbigny 1840) is distributed across the Macaronesia 

archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries. For discussion of taxonomic status within each 

archipelago see Faria et al. (2017). Although there are many references in the literature to studies on 

the reproduction of intertidal gastropods, very little is known about the development, morphology and 

environmental requirements of P. candei larvae. Most available information is derived from other 

Patella congeners for which the development and reproductive cycle have been described (i.e. Orton 

et al. 1956; Bowman and Lewis 1986; Espinosa et al. 2002; McCarthy et al. 2008; Ribeiro 2008; 

Ribeiro et al. 2009; Prusina et al. 2014). In Azores, P. candei is known to be mostly a winter-breeder, 

although recruits can be found throughout the year (see Chapter 6). Although simultaneous 

hermaphroditic individuals have been found before and likely associated to a one-time aberration 

(Cunha et al. 2007), sexes in P. candei are separated and fertilization is external. When reproductively 

active, mature male and female gametes are released directly into the water column, and upon 

fertilization, larvae undertake a series of development stages until they settle and recruit in suitable 

substrata. Because ocean warming is likely to influence larval duration, dispersal and survival, this 

study aims to investigate the influence of temperature on larval development of P. candei. This will 

improve our ability to predict P. candei larval dynamics throughout its distributional area under 

projected scenarios of ocean warming, and may help to re-design protective management measures. 

 

2. Methods 

2.1. Collection and treatment of gametes 

Experimental treatments were carried out in wintertime, from November 2015 to March 2016, to 

ensure that sampling could take place during P. candei reproductive peak in Azores (see Chapter 6 

and Vale 2016), thereby increasing the chances of collecting individuals with fully mature gonads. A 

total of 50 individuals of P. candei (shell length &gt; 30 mm) were collected from a rocky shore platform in 

São Miguel island, Azores (37º443’9.33’’N - 25º38’20.94’’W). Individuals were kept alive and 

immediately transported to the laboratory in a cool box for processing. Limpets were then dissected to 

determine their sex through gonad colouration and the gonads were staged following the semi-

quantitative scale of Orton et al. 1956 (Fig. 1). Only individuals showing a fully developed gonad 

(stage V) were selected for in-vitro fertilization trials. For sperm stock, male gonads were carefully 

punctured and a few ?l of undiluted sperm were added to 500 ml of filtered and UV sterilised seawater 

(FSW). The solution was filtered through a 300 ?m mesh to remove gonad debris and then allowed to 

rest for 30 minutes (sperm is immobile and becomes active when in contact with seawater for a certain 

period of time). Sperm motility and concentration were checked in a Neubauer chamber (chamber 

depth 0.1 mm) under an optical microscope. The treatment of individual limpets and larvae was 

performed under room temperature (~ 19ºC) and sterilized conditions were maintained throughout the 

entire procedure. Sperm stock solution was used within the hour. The same ripening/ filtering 

approach was performed on stage V female gonads. Because oocyte/egg alkalinisation is known to 

improve fertilization rates (see Hodgson et al. 2007; Pérez et al. 2016), clean oocytes were placed for 

2 hours in 500 ml FSW with pH = 9.0 (adjusted with NH4OH) before fertilization trials.

quantitative scale scores gonad development, ranging between empty neuters (sex and gonad indistinguishable) to fully 

developed gonads (stage V). In P. candei, female gonads are dark brown, whereas in males, the gonad is yellow to orange.  

 

2.2. Experimental procedure 

Fertilization experiments were performed under controlled conditions of light and temperature using 

three environmental test chambers (SANYO). Given the sea surface temperature range in the Azores 

throughout the year (roughly ranging from 14ºC to 22ºC), three constant water temperatures were 

selected for fertilization trials: 14, 18 and 22ºC. In each case, a gentle airflow system and a 12:12 h 

day/night cycle was applied for a total of three rearing replicates. In each replicate, batches of cleaned 

eggs (pre-treated in pH 9 FSW) were placed in 100 ml FSW glass beakers, for a final concentration of 

~ 70 eggs ml-1. To achieve higher fertilization rates (see Hodgson et al. 2007), a pre-adjusted sperm 

stock volume was added to each beaker so that a final concentration of ~ 106 sperm ml-1 was 

achieved. The average stage of development in each replicate culture was determined by visual 

examination of larvae under a microscope of three 1ml subsamples taken at pre-defined times (T: 1 h, 

2 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h). Before sampling, cultures were gently stirred to 

homogenise the distribution of larvae in the water. Samples were placed in 1.5 ml tubes and fixed with 

one drop of 5% formalin. In all samples, the numbers of unfertilized eggs, embryo on initial process of 

cell division (cleavage) with 2-4 blastomeres, morula, swimming trochophore and pre- and post-

torsional veliger were recorded. After 45 h upon fertilization, larvae were fed periodically (24 h 

intervals) with Phaedactylum tricornutum (preliminary trials showed that P. candei larvae are 

planktotrophic). Moreover, after each sampling event, a 64 ?m mesh filter was carefully used to decant 

larvae onto 100 ml of freshly made FSW. The FSW was previously stored at each experimental 

temperature, so as to avoid temperature oscillations during water changes. 

 

2.3. Statistical analyses 

For each sampling time, chi-square tests were used to evaluate the relationship between stages of 

development (STAGE) and temperature (TEMP). Moreover, differences between treatments were 

examined using a 2-way permutational ANOVA with the following factors: TEMP (3 levels; fixed) and 

STAGE (6 levels; fixed). All tests were done using PERMANOVA+ based on Euclidean distances and 

using 999 permutations (Anderson et al. 2008). Prior to analyses, data were checked for homogeneity 

of variance and transformations were applied when needed (Underwood 1997). Analyses were 



	 143 

performed on untransformed data when attempts to stabilize variances through transformation were 

unsuccessful; in such cases, a more conservative significance level (? = 0.01) was used when testing 

for differences (Underwood 1997). Pairwise tests were used to resolve significant differences within 

stages. Survival rates were determined for all temperatures at every pre-defined time. 

 

3. Results 

This study showed, for the first time, that P. candei larvae are planktotrophic as they were observed 

feeding on diatoms. Experimental trials were therefore conducted on feeding larvae. As expected, the 

sequence of development stages observed in this study was similar to others related limpet species 

(Dodd 1957; Wanninger et al. 1999; Espinosa et al. 2002; Ribeiro 2008). Upon fertilization, embryos 

undergo a series of cleavages before they develop into the so-called trochophore larvae typical for 

molluscs. They are pear-shaped and girdled by a ring of cilia that enables them to swim actively, both 

horizontally and vertically, with steady swimming often alternated with abrupt bursts of speed. Before 

they can metamorphose into the adult form, the trochophore develops into a pre and post-torsional 

veliger. The trochophore-veliger transition involves torsion, which is the clockwise turn of the visceral 

portion relative to the head-foot portion (Ghiselin 1966), the development of embryonic shell and 

formation of the operculum. Upon completion of torsion, veligers are able to withdraw into their shells, 

exhibit cephalic tentacles, both eyespots are clearly noticeable and the foot is developed. The latter 

will be used to adhere to the substrate during the settlement of competent larvae. Unfortunately, 

complete mortality occurred at all temperatures after T = 72 h within the post-veliger stage, and final 

metamorphoses were not observed. 

With the exception of T = 6 h, chi-square tests revealed that, the observed proportion of larval 

development stages at each sampling time were not independent of temperature (Table S1). 

Moreover, significant interaction terms were detected in most ANOVA analyses (except in T= 6 h and 

T = 12 h; Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). Generally, the proportion of early stages decreased with time and this 

was more evident at increasing temperatures. Later stages (i.e. trochophore and veligers) were also 

found sooner at higher temperatures (Fig. 2). For instance, larvae at 14ºC took more than twice the 

time to reach the veliger state then at 22ºC (median development time was estimated as the time 

required by at least 50% of the observed larvae to reach a given stage). 

In addition to an acceleration in development, a greater cumulative percentage of embryos and larvae 

exhibited abnormal development at higher temperatures. Although no significant differences were 

detected in instantaneous survival rates across temperatures (identical slopes), the cumulative 

survivorship decreased in time and was consistently lower at higher temperatures (Fig. 3; Table 1). 

For example, about 25% of larvae survived until the end of experiment (72 h) at 22ºC, about half the 

average survival (~ 50%) recorded at 14ºC. Differences found among temperatures were mainly 

determined at initial stages of development (Fig. 3).

4. Discussion 

This study tested the response of P. candei embryos and larvae to temperature conditions that are 

usually experienced in the waters surrounding the archipelago of Azores throughout the year (Amorim 

et al. 2017). Being winter brooders, P. candei larvae in Azores are expected to perform better and 

attain higher fitness at colder temperatures. In fact, results showed that development was accelerated 

but the percentage of developmental abnormalities increased at higher temperatures, negatively 

affecting the cumulative survivorship of larvae. Consequently, as sea surface temperatures continue to 

rise, embryos and larvae of P. candei will be subject to a deleterious effect, likely reducing the time 

window each year for successful reproduction and larval development. Thus recruitment and the 

recovery potential of exploited populations of P. candei will be diminished throughout its distribution 

area. Relatively small perturbations in recruitment can translate to large alterations of adult 

populations (Uthicke et al. 2009). If these are accompanied by high levels of exploitation, the 

resilience and survival of the species can be greatly threatened. Therefore, understanding the exact 

capacity of a given species to disperse under distinct environmental conditions is especially important 

in fisheries planning and implementation of conservation measures. Unfortunately, due to poor rearing 

conditions or intrinsic limitations while culturing invertebrate larvae in vitro (e.g. proliferation of 

pathogens; excessive larval manipulation during water changes; larval density constraints), the final 

metamorphosis stage was never detected, and the full extent of the PLD in P. candei could not be 

determined. However, increasing the larval development rate in P. candei under increasing 

temperatures, will likely reduce the full potential of dispersal and population connectivity, with 

individuals recruiting more locally near their source adult populations, hence increasing structure 

among populations. At the very least, results indicate that the PLD of P. candei is over three days; in 

all experimental conditions, actively swimming larvae were observed 3 days (72 h) after fertilization 

and before full larvae mortality occurred. This estimate, however, can be further reduced. For 

instance, Ribeiro (2008) showed that patellid larvae accelerate their development and reach 

metamorphosis faster when in the presence of their preferred settling substrata (i.e. crustose red 

algae-covered stones) supporting other earlier studies showing that metamorphosis can only be 

achieved if suitable settlement inducers are present (Smith 1935; Dodd 1957). 

While the relatively cold adapted and planktotrophic nature of P. candei larvae in Azores may suggest 

a broader geographic distribution of the species throughout the NE Atlantic region, current populations 

are restricted to the archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, and even these exhibit striking 

dissimilarities among them (Faria et al. 2017). As so, and aside from evolutionary and 

phylogeographic considerations, the suggestion that the PLD of P. candei might be shorter than 

expected and the occurrence of oceanographic features such as eddies, currents, and meanders are 

likely to be the most prominent factors limiting the connectivity capacity between populations of P. 

candei among all archipelagos and elsewhere. Particular adaptations to each archipelago 

environmental conditions can also act to determine restrictions in population connectivity and 

individual dispersal. The adaptability of P. candei to regional climate does not imply strict 

dependencies for the species throughout its area of distribution. The temperature dependence of 



	 146 

larval development within a species may vary with latitude due to local adaptations of geographically 

distant populations, a phenomenon that has been previously reported (Drent 2002). Due to, and also 

in support of the isolated nature of P. candei populations (see Faria et al. 2017), future research 

should search for inter-specific variation in PLD at any given temperature across the entire distribution 

of P. candei sensu lato throughout the archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries, and examine if 

an evidence for variation can be explained by specific metabolic adaptations to particular 

environmental conditions. Indeed, multi-population comparisons are urgently needed to better predict 

pending ecosystem changes. 

The observed pattern of sensitivity of P. candei to higher temperatures also explains the reproductive 

timing of the species in Azores. As previously described (see Chapter 6), the yearly recruitment in P. 

candei is known to peak between January and March, which implies the presence of larvae in open 

waters a few days or weeks before, during the North hemisphere winter season. With monthly 

temperatures ranging between 14 - 16ºC (Amorim et al. 2017), this time of the year seems to provide 

the necessary and optimal temperature conditions for larvae to develop and survive. Moreover, 

although growth was not measured in this study, P. candei larvae at colder temperatures may be less 

developed at a given size, but are more likely to settle at smaller sizes than larvae reared in warmer 

conditions (e.g. Laurel et al. 2014). Yet, if larval rearing could have been performed under colder 

temperatures, the relationship between temperature and survivorship would likely follow a dome-

shaped curve, as lower temperatures outside the species optimal range would also reduce the survival 

of individuals (Munday et al. 2009). 

The effect of temperature on the developmental rate of marine invertebrates has long been recognized 

with many studies showing that increasing temperatures accelerate larval development and provide a 

deleterious effect to larval survivorship (e.g. Anil et al. 2001; Thiyagarajan et al. 2003; Randall and 

Szmant 2009; Bashevkin and Pechenik 2015). In some cases, however, warmer temperatures may 

provide favourable conditions to the early life stages of free-spawning marine invertebrates, as 

increasing growth rates will make larvae larger and less vulnerable to size-specific predation 

(Bashevkin and Pechenik 2015; Miller et al. 1988). Nevertheless, the PLD of a given species will be 

inevitably affected if temperatures are likely to increase. For instance, the relationship between PLD 

and temperature derived by O’Connor et al. (2007), based on 69 species of invertebrates and fish of 

mostly temperate distribution, shows that an increase of 1°C from 14 to 15°C should decrease PLD by 

~ 10% and a 3°C temperature increase from 14 to 17°C should decrease PLD by ~ 25.5%. Although 

temperature may be the single most important factor determining development and growth rates of 

early life stages in marine invertebrates, the capacity of adult populations to be replenished by new 

individuals is dependent on a vast number of factors (e.g. larval supply; food availability) that can act 

collectively in determining the eventual distribution and abundance of a species (Cowen and 

Sponaugle 2009). In order to assess the potential outcomes for P. candei in a changing ocean, future 

studies should include multiple stressors experiments on larval development, tolerance and 

survivorship, and assess the interactive effects of factors such as temperature, salinity and food 

availability on larval success. These should not only focus on various life-history stages, but also 

different populations of a species (Helmuth et al. 2006). This study emphasizes the importance of 



	 147 

including larval development information in models attempting to predict the effects of climate change 

on species distributions. Such data may be used to refine current and future transport models for 

exploited limpets such as P. candei under changing environmental conditions in the North Atlantic 

archipelagic region, helping in adjusting conservation and resource-management actions aimed at 

protecting such important and endemic resource.

CHAPTER 8 

Overview and general discussion 

 

Discussion 

Summary of thesis findings 

The main reasoning behind this PhD lies in the current need for better management practices and 

conservation strategies for the protection of two commonly exploited limpet species (i.e. Patella candei 

and P. aspera) from the Macaronesia archipelagos (NE Atlantic). This thesis had three major 

objectives that included the analysis of genetic, recruitment and larval development variability; these 

three aspects are crucial in providing a holistic understanding of the dynamics and resilience to 

exploitation of these populations. 

For the first time, species-specific microsatellite genetic markers for both species were developed. A 

total of 12 and 17 markers were characterized for P. candei and P. aspera, respectively [Chapter 2 

(Faria et al. 2016) and Chapter 3 (Faria et al. 2015)]. These were amplified in optimized multiplex 

reactions and used to investigate species’ genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity 

across Azores, Madeira and Canaries archipelagos [Chapter 4 (Faria et al. 2017a) and Chapter 5 

(Faria et al. 2017b)]. On top of evolutionary and ecological considerations, genetic analyses also 

provided important information of applied interest for the management of the fishery across the region.  

Secondly, a monitoring programme to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in recruitment of 

P. candei was established (Chapter 6). Genetic and recruitment data, along with other aspects of the 

reproductive cycle of the species, provide vital information for the fine-tuning of conservation actions 

aimed at fostering the sustainable exploitation of the resource (e.g. seasonal fishing closures). The 

fine scale of the monitoring programme also allowed exploring the relative importance of 

environmental conditions (e.g. sea surface temperatures) in driving temporal and spatial variation in 

recruitment and identifying the relevant scale at which physical processes are coupled with larval 

recruitment.  

Thirdly, an experimental rearing procedure was established to investigate the influence of temperature 

on larval development of P. candei (Chapter 7). Understanding the role of temperature on larval 

development is not only important to foresee any developmental changes expected under current 

predictions of future climate change, but also to produce high-resolution bio-physical models that are 

able to simulate and model larval transport in its natural environment, following its life-history traits, 

assessing at the same time the role of transport in regulating population connectivity, and the role of 

different biological and physical factors on dispersal. 

The main findings can be briefly summarized as follows: 

• Twelve microsatellite markers were developed for Patella candei; 



	 159 

• Seventeen microsatellite markers were developed for Patella aspera; 

• Low genetic diversity was detected for both species across the Macaronesian archipelagos of 

Azores, Madeira and Canaries; 

• Morphological differentiation among archipelagos was detected in P. candei; 

• Populations of P. candei from each archipelago are genetically differentiated and/or 

ecologically isolated; 

• Populations of P. aspera from Azores are genetically distinct from those of Madeira and 

Canaries; 

• There was no evidence for population genetic structure within archipelago (i.e. among islands 

in Azores) for any of the species studied; 

• High inbreeding in P. aspera is likely a consequence of human harvesting; 

• A marked peak in recruitment of P. candei occurred during winter/spring months and was 

found to be positively associated with significant wave height; 

• Increasing temperature significantly shortens the time required for larval development in P. 

candei, but negatively affects its survivorship. 

 

Genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity of limpets in Macaronesia 

The observed levels of genetic variability of P. candei and P. aspera populations throughout 

Macaronesia were relatively low when compared to other patellid species inhabiting the mainland (e.g 

Perez et al. 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2010). Whether this is a consequence of the isolated nature of 

populations inhabiting remote oceanic islands and/or the influence of over-harvesting, the relatively 

impoverished genetic diversity observed in both species may render them more susceptible to 

environmental changes. On the one hand, it is not uncommon that small, isolated populations and/or 

populations at the range edges, exhibit relatively lower levels of genetic diversity compared to more 

connected populations, or those living in the middle of the species range, both on neutral or non-

neutral markers, and that insular populations have less genetic variation than their mainland 

counterparts (Frankham 1997). If dispersal between mainland and insular populations is completely 

restricted, then genetic variability in such populations can only be regenerated via mutation, with 

genetic drift and inbreeding playing a dominant role on reducing such variability (Frankham 1996). 

Moreover, under limited availability and variability of suitable niches, isolated populations will often 

exhibit very specific and localised adaptive traits (for review on local adaptations see Sanford and 

Kelly 2011), and therefore their potential to adapt to any environmental changes may be narrow (or 

beneficial, when considering local adaptation as a direct evidence that species are capable of evolving 

in the face of environmental change; see overview in Conover 1998). In such cases, the ‘raw material’, 

hence genetic variation, for evolutionary change is restricted and isolated populations become more 

susceptible to demographic and environmental stochasticity processes and changes (e.g. Eldridge et 



	 160 

al. 1999). Considering the Macaronesia region and given the environmental particularities of each 

archipelago, patellid populations are likely to have preserved distinct adaptive traits and subsets of 

alleles; if individuals could migrate freely among archipelagos, one would have expected more 

genetically diverse populations. On the other hand, the anthropogenic pressure on populations, 

through the constant removal of individuals, may negatively affect the genetic pool of limpets, leading 

to putative deleterious effects on the species adaptive potential and survivorship (see Walsh et al. 

2006; Allendorf and Hard 2009). This is further enhanced by the isolated nature of populations. For 

instance, the induced genetic changes created by the size-biased removal of individuals in P. aspera 

populations, and given the species specific life-history traits, provides a good example of how humans, 

via harvesting, can influence the genetic composition of populations (Faria et al. 2017b; Smith et al. 

1991; Hauser et al. 2002; Pinsky and Palumbi 2014). 

Two major aspects were revealed following population structure analyses of P. candei and P. aspera 

samples across the Macaronesia region: firstly, populations from Azores are genetically and probably 

ecologically isolated from those of Madeira and the Canaries; secondly, unrestricted migratory 

movements associated to relaxed oceanographic barriers and adequate larval dispersal potential are 

likely responsible for maintaining genetic homogeneity across patellid populations throughout the 

archipelago of Azores. Hence, patellid larvae are able to develop and disperse among islands, 

probably contributing for a metapopulation status of limpets in this remote archipelago. However, the 

presence of genetic homogeneity among populations may not be fully indicative that the populations 

are significantly demographically connected. By definition, demographic connectivity considers that 

the level of exchange must be sufficient to impact the demographic rates of the local population(s) 

(Lowe and Allendorf 2010); it is several orders of magnitude larger than the level of exchange required 

for the maintenance of genetic homogeneity among subpopulations. Whereas relatively few migrants 

(or lots if populations are very large) among subpopulations can lead to genetic homogeneity (e.g. 

Díaz-Viloria et al. 2009; Goldstien et al. 2009; Hellberg 2009), the proportion of migrants necessary to 

lead to a significant demographic connectivity among populations, although arbitrary, needs to be 

higher and occur frequently (i.e. in most years, Hawkins et al. 2016). Such demographic connectivity 

of meta-populations is strongly dependent on conditions such as larval dispersal, habitat quality, adult 

density and mortality on recipient populations. Just because two populations are genetically 

undifferentiated does not necessarily mean they are connected by consistent gene flow events (e.g. 

are P. aspera populations in Madeira and Canaries truly connected?). This level of uncertainty has 

strong implications for conservation purposes, and highlights the importance of complementing 

genetic data with population dynamics and demography studies to understand whether a natural 

system fits a metapopulation model or not (see Lamy et al. 2012). 

Despite the relatively short geographic distance between Madeira and Canaries, there was a 

significant genetic and morphological distinction among P. candei populations from these 

archipelagos. Without any major recognisable oceanographic barriers, one would expect that 

Selvagens, which stands almost in the middle of these two archipelagos, would work as a stepping-

stone habitat, allowing the movement of individuals and facilitating connectivity among archipelagos. 

Interestingly, unlike that found for P. candei, there was no evidence of genetic structuring in 



	 161 

populations of P. aspera from Madeira and Canaries. Species-specific life-history traits (e.g. pelagic 

larval duration, larval behaviour) and differences in the evolutionary history of each species (e.g. 

distinct times and routes of colonisation, possible secondary contact events, etc.) are likely to be 

responsible for such patterns. Additionally, the particular environmental characteristics associated to 

each species preferred habitat (i.e. P. aspera is mainly a subtidal species and P. candei is mostly 

distributed at mid-shore levels) may have also been accountable in determining the within-species 

differentiation observed; it is possible that P. aspera has found more underwater habitat (i.e. shallow 

seamounts) during its evolution so as to allow a more efficient stepping stone between Madeira and 

Canaries, which could explain the apparent lack of genetic structure between the two archipelagos. 

Moreover, in contrast to the relatively stable conditions that P. aspera individuals experience 

underwater, P. candei habitats are more diverse, complex and heterogeneous, exposed to a large 

range of climatic conditions; to cope with such conditions, adaptive processes associated with niche 

differentiation are more likely to have happen in P. candei than in P. aspera. Indeed, the existence of 

two distinct habitat-related morphs of P. candei (referred for the Azores: the ‘fly limpet’ and the 

‘smooth limpet’ lend support to this argument. Indeed, adaptive differentiation among marine 

invertebrates is not uncommon (Hauser and Carvalho 2008), with populations often evolving varying 

tolerances over a broad range of spatial scales to alongshore gradients of environmental factors that 

include salinity and pollution (e.g. Sokolova and Boulding 2004; Untersee and Pechenik 2007), vertical 

stresses associated to the intertidal zone (e.g. Janson 1982; Schmidt et al. 2000; Pardo and Johnson 

2005), and wave exposure gradients (e.g. Struhsaker 1968; Kirby et al. 1994). 

Although geographical distance per se can have possibly influenced differentiation of both P. aspera 

and P. candei throughout the Macaronesia, the influence of other processes such as the historical 

shifting of ocean circulation (Haug and Tiedemann 1998), the current oceanographic complexity 

(Johnson and Stevens 2000) as well as mesoscale variability across the region (Barton 2001) cannot 

be discarded and may have played an important role in limiting gene exchange among archipelagos, 

both at historical and contemporary scales. Other factors affecting larval development and dispersion 

may have also acted to produce the observed differentiation among archipelagos. For instance, at 

certain temperatures the final stage of larval development before metamorphosis in P. candei can be 

achieved in just 3 days upon fertilization (see Chapter 7) suggesting that the putative pelagic larval 

duration (PLD) may not be fully realized, and that larvae may be unable to reach far distant-

populations (i.e. among archipelagos); larval longevity is still undetermined but may be shorter than 

expected considering other patellid limpets (i.e. studies in other patellids indicate a PLD up to 27 days; 

see Ribeiro 2008). Moreover, a considerable number of larvae may be retained near spawning sites 

due to behavioural preferences, with larval dispersion only occurring during weather extremes acting 

at a regional scale (i.e. within archipelago). Significant barriers to gene flow, either biological or 

physical-induced, are likely to have prompted isolation among archipelagos allowing evolution to take 

its own course, free of influence from other areas, resulting in the allopatric divergence of populations 

(Losos and Ricklefs 2009). The P. candei complex seems to constitute a good example of such 

common form of speciation (Faria et al. 2017a). 



	 162 

Although the number of studies addressing marine population connectivity has grown significantly in 

the past decades, there are still many uncertainties about the extent to which larvae are able to 

disperse among populations. This is mostly a consequence of the difficulty in tracking larvae in such 

an open system that is vast and complex. Although tags can be applied to some species to provide a 

means to directly measure larval movement (e.g. Jones et al. 1999; Almany et al. 2007), there is still 

much to be done and understood about processes and factors affecting dispersal, population 

structuring and connectivity. Understanding how population genetic structure is formed and evolves in 

space and time is therefore a challenging task and often restricted by our ability to fully address the 

complexity and interactive nature of all processes involved. The integration of genetic data with 

biological, ecological and environmental information, as provided by this thesis, offers better insights 

into the evolutionary mechanisms that have led species to their current distributions, pinpointing 

aspects about their dynamics, perseverance and survival in time. 

 

Recruitment and the influence of environmental variables 

There is no doubt that the rate of input of new individuals into population is a key aspect of population 

dynamics, especially when considering marine exploited species, where population persistency 

follows a thin balance between individuals that are removed by harvesting and individuals that are 

added to the population via recruitment. Clearly not all individuals arriving at a recruitment habitat will 

have equal chances of surviving. Instead individual recruit performance will depend on dispersal 

histories and carry-over effects leading to intra-specifically variable phenotypes that may or may not 

reach reproductive stages (for overview see Caley et al. 1996). 

The monitoring programme, spatially and temporally replicated, performed in Chapter 6, allowed to 

assess the levels of recruitment of the exploited limpet P. candei in Azores. Recruitment was recorded 

throughout the year but its intensity varied in space and time. In general, a marked peak in recruitment 

occurred during winter/spring months, when sea surfaces temperatures were lower and wave 

turbulence higher. In fact, there was a significant correlation between limpet recruitment and sea 

surface temperature, significant wave height, wave period and wave direction. While each of these 

environmental variables may have influenced recruitment on its own, significant wave height was 

probably the most important factor triggering the recruitment of P. candei, since it was the only 

variable that accounted for inter-annual variation in recruitment levels. Additional sampling over longer 

time frames will likely support these findings and may help identify long-term patterns of recruitment 

variation and how they can be influenced by future and predicted environmental changes associated 

to global change. Moreover, in this study patterns of recruitment were restricted to four locations in 

one island; if possible, future research should include the monitoring of recruits and reproductive traits 

at several locations across the region (including other islands) to detect synchronised and/or 

asynchronous events. This would highlight aspects related to metapopulation processes and source-

sink dynamics among islands and/or subpopulations within each archipelago. Given that the viability of 

a population may depend on surrounding populations, this information would greatly benefit the 

delineation of conservation strategies and reserve spatial planning (Akçakaya et al. 2007). 



	 163 

 

Temperature influence in limpet larval development 

Not surprisingly, temperature was found to influence the development in P. candei larvae (see Chapter 

7) and therefore changes in ocean temperature will likely have an impact on larval dispersal and 

population connectivity. Populations will become more dependent on local recruitment for 

replenishment, and thus more vulnerable to severe population fluctuations and extinction (Eckert 

2003); first, rising sea temperature will promote the shortening of pelagic larval duration, which in turn 

may reduce the time larvae spend on the water column and hence reduce the degree of larval 

exchange among populations; secondly, further rises in sea temperature may cause massive larval 

mortality and, eventually, prevent replenishment of the populations. Moreover, the ‘preference’ for 

lower temperatures is in agreement with the fact that P. candei in Azores is a winter-breeder recruiting 

mostly during the colder period of the year (see Chapters 6 and 7). 

From an evolutionary perspective, and given the above mentioned influence of temperature in larval 

development, global warming since the last glacial period may have led to shorter larval development 

times and thus greater separation of limpet stocks in the Macaronesia among the various 

archipelagos, effectively promoting the isolation of archipelagos. Except for populations of P. aspera in 

Madeira and Canaries, this hypothesis would be in agreement with the genetic structure detected 

across Macaronesia. 

Future research should be conducted not only on P. candei but also on P. aspera and test the 

response of each species’ larval development under isolated and combined effects of multiple abiotic 

stressors. This would provide valuable knowledge, which could be used to refine current and future 

transport models for limpets in Macaronesia under distinct environmental conditions. Moreover, an 

adequate optimization of rearing conditions is needed to fully quantify the PLD in both P. candei and 

P. aspera. 

 

Implications for conservation and management 

This PhD thesis highlights the complex nature of oceanic island connectivity and historical and 

contemporary factors associated with it, while attempting to delineate adequate management units for 

the conservation of highly exploited coastal invertebrates, such as P. candei and P. aspera in 

Macaronesia. It is known that conservation planning and species management can operate at many 

levels, from whole ecosystems and communities down to individual organisms. At any one of these 

levels, genetic approaches have proven to be powerful tools for revealing ecologically relevant insights 

into marine population dynamics and informing conservation approaches and strategies. In fact, over 

the last decades, the use of genetic data in conservation has become an important and expanding 

discipline with a strong theoretical framework. Yet, combining genetic data with information about the 

ecology, life-history traits and behavioural patterns of a species can provide a better and holistic 

understanding of population processes and how they influence each other (see Lowe and Allendorf 



	 164 

2010). This can greatly assist the development of management and conservation strategies to 

safeguard current stocks. 

So, are limpets resilient enough to overcome fishing pressure, given their oceanic isolation status? 

Unlikely! Especially for P. aspera, which is highly harvested. It is also a protandrous hermaphrodite 

(Martins et al. 1987) and collection is largely biased towards the larger (hence mostly females) 

individuals; this size-selective harvesting can affect many different aspects of the life history and 

ecology of the species (e.g. Fenberg and Roy 2012) and has the potential to drastically skew sex 

ratios (e.g. McGovern et al. 1998), sizes at sex change (e.g. Hawkins and Roberts 2004; Rivera-

Ingraham et al. 2011), population size structure (e.g. Branch 1975; Lasiak 1993; Branch and Moreno 

1994; Sagarin et al. 2007) and affect P. aspera reproductive output and maintenance of populations 

(e.g. Harding et al. 2007). Given its isolated status, if new individuals, or gene material for that matter, 

are not provided from elsewhere, local extinction is definitely likely. Harvesting-induced changes to the 

genetic pool of the species (e.g. reduction in genetic diversity) are likely to become a major 

disadvantage in the face of any environmental fluctuations. Moreover, recent demographic data 

suggests that populations in many of the islands are already at very low sizes and if protective 

measures are not put in place, stocks will soon run out. It is likely that healthy and small pockets of 

individuals at sites inaccessible by humans may exist, but the genetic and ecological consequences of 

the intensive size-selective harvesting that is taking place may lead to local extinctions and ultimately 

affect the survival of the species (Fenberg and Roy 2008). Also, space availability is a major concern 

in P. aspera, which is mostly distributed at very low levels in the shore down to 20 m depths; here, 

competition for space, especially due to greater proliferation of macroalgae, limits the capacity of P. 

aspera populations to settle and recruit (Boaventura et al. 2002, Martins et al. 2008). This effect is 

further intensified if limpets and other herbivores (e.g. sea urchins) are removed or absent (see 

Coleman et al. 2006). Glints of hope for P. aspera populations do exist. For instance, a recent 

hypothesis suggests that males are compensating the removal of larger females by undergoing sex 

change earlier and presumably at smaller sizes (Martins et al. 2017); although this adaptive and 

resilient response can balance the sex-ratio of the species, the amount of gametes released into the 

water is drastically reduced with obvious negative consequences for the reproductive output of P. 

aspera (see Faria et al. 2017b). 

As for P. candei, although the isolated status of populations from each archipelago may naturally 

threaten their survival (Frankham 1998), current information regarding its life-history traits and field 

observational data suggests that P. candei is likely to withstand most environmental and 

anthropogenically-induced threats. First, P. candei is not as intensively harvested as P. aspera; 

secondly, P. candei is a gonochoric species and individuals are known to reproduce at smaller sizes 

than P. aspera, and thus avoid any size-selective harvesting consequences; finally, recruitment is 

mostly occurring on the upper eulittoral where space pre-emption is less likely compared to lower 

shore levels. Overall, the opportunistic behaviour of P. candei is likely to provide the species the 

necessary resilience to face harvesting pressures and environmental changes. 



	 165 

So, what recommendations can be made to promote better sustainable practices in limpet harvesting? 

At the very least, conservation actions should follow the stock delimitation that is suggested by the 

genetic data from this thesis, with two independent stocks of P. aspera (Azores and Madeira plus 

Canaries), and three stocks for P. candei, one per archipelago. Nevertheless, given that genetic 

methods alone provide little information on demographic connectivity (Lowe and Allendorf 2010; 

Hawkins et al. 2016), and that limpet populations in most islands seem rather depleted, immediate 

actions should take a more conservative approach and consider each island particular population 

dynamics together with regional stock delimitations. No-take marine reserves should be put in place 

across islands and given that surveillance cannot be everywhere at any time, at least one of such 

areas per island should be constantly surveyed and monitored. For instance, the marine protected 

area (MPA) that includes the inner Caldeira of Monte da Guia at Faial island, Azores, which is a no-

take and no-entry area and highly surveyed by local authorities, constitutes a tantalizing indication of 

what rocky shores would be if limpets were not heavily exploited (Vale 2016).  

Indeed, these no-take marine reserves are increasingly regarded as effective tools for the 

management and conservation of marine ecosystems. Evidence of the positive effects of MPAs on the 

structure of exploited (although not exclusively so) populations is accumulating in the scientific 

literature (Halpern 2003; Sciberas et al. 2015). At population levels, these include increases in 

abundance, size and reproductive output as well as the restoration of population structure and sex-

ratios of targeted species. A successful MPA, however, is one that not only protects the species 

within, but also functions as source/provider of larvae and adults (spill-over effect) to adjacent areas 

thus contributing to population maintenance and genetic diversity at broader spatial scales. 

Additionally, current legislation about seasonal fishing closures, minimum legal catch sizes and limpet 

protection zones should be re-evaluated (for more specific details see Faria et al. 2017a, 2017b). For 

instance, in the Azores, the most recent legislation regulating the amount of limpets collected by 

qualified catcher is of 80 kg per day of fresh-living weight (Portaria nº 73/2015). This seems an 

excessive amount; for instance, let us consider the number of licensed catchers in S. Miguel island in 

2014 (16 catchers), the duration of the harvesting season (153 days), the average mass of individuals 

with at least the minimum size allowed for harvesting (~ 15 g); and the total area where limpets may 

virtually occur throughout the island (9.43 × 105  m2; excluding protected areas and considering that P. 

aspera is mostly distributed from the very low shore to 5 m depth); if licensed individuals do max-out 

their catching limits, then each m2 should have at least a total of 14 limpets with the minimum size for 

harvesting (45 mm). Although this is a very rough estimate, as there are no scientific and spatially-

explicit data regarding the abundance of P. aspera below low tide levels, observational evidence 

suggest that this threshold is well beyond current abundances on most rocky shores of São Miguel 

island. Overall, the (arbitrary?) limit set by the current legislation seems counter-productive and does 

not support the sustainable use of such ecological and economical important resource in the region. 

Moreover, stock integrity becomes further at risk due to illegal poaching and by recreational harvesters 

that are allowed to collect 1.5 kg of limpets in the intertidal zone during weekends and holidays. 

Updated and adequate population census and studies concerning the life-history, size structure and 



	 166 

growth patterns of limpets in Macaronesia are therefore urgently needed. For instance, a well-

performed study of P. aspera stock integrity in Madeira by Sousa et al. (2017) suggests that the 

species is currently under-exploited in the island. In comparison to Azores, harvesting regulations 

seem more restrictive; the number of licenses and daily capture quantities are more limiting than those 

applied in Azores. Although in the short-term, these regulations may be preventing P. aspera stock in 

Madeira from over-exploitation, the high demand for such resource in Azores (i.e. limpets caught in 

Madeira are often sold in the Azores), the low frequency of older individuals in the natural populations 

in Madeira (Sousa et al. 2017), and the lack of knowledge on connectivity processes among nearby 

islands and archipelagos, may negatively affect the susceptibility of the stock to fishing pressure. 

Overall, improving the scientific basis of stock identification and assessment requires the integration of 

a broad spectrum of complementary techniques e.g. genetic methods, morphometrics, catch data, life-

history characteristics, recruitment and population census, etc. (see Begg and Waldman 1999). These 

should allow a more accurate determination of stock structure and populations dynamics of exploited 

species, a vital aspect for designing appropriate management and conservation regulations in 

fisheries. 

 

Limitations and Future Perspectives 

This study would greatly benefit from a more extensive sampling approach, particularly with the 

inclusion of individuals/ populations from all islands across the Macaronesia where P. candei and P. 

aspera occur. This would be especially important in the case of Selvagens, which are located between 

Madeira and Canaries archipelagos and though to hold some of the older/ancestral forms of Patella in 

the Macaronesia region. Not only this would strengthen our understanding of genetic population 

structure and connectivity processes, but would also provide a better insight into the evolutionary 

history of both P. candei and P. aspera across the region. Unfortunately, due to logistics constraints 

no such sampling could be performed for this thesis. 

To increase our understanding about population dynamics, stock integrity and the identification of 

historical, environmental and biological factors influencing metapopulation connectivity, future 

research should follow a multidisciplinary approach by pairing genetic tools with more detailed 

information on larval and recruitment sampling, behavioural studies, natural tags and oceanographic 

simulation. For each species and considering the genetic relationship among archipelagos detected in 

this thesis, future work should be aimed at: 

• Increasing the spatial scale detection of recruitment levels across the region; 

• Testing larval development under distinct and combined environmental factors; 

• Combining modules of biological and physical nature to simulate and model larval transport in 

its natural environment, following its life-history traits, assessing at the same time the role of 

transport in regulating population connectivity, and the role of different biological and physical 

factors on limpet dispersal; 



	 167 

• Establishing yearly census programs to access the structure and demography of populations; 

• Investigating the role of limpet gene expression and transcriptome responses in adaptation to 

the environmental particularities of each archipelago (i.e. thermal tolerance). 

Above all, and given the endemic nature of P. candei and P. aspera and their isolation status within 

the NE Atlantic archipelagos, stock conservation should follow an integrated management approach, 

provided that stock management authorities and scientific community work together to find the best 

way to protect and guarantee the sustainable use of natural resources (i.e. limpets) across 

archipelagos. More generally, mitigating the effects of harvesting would require us to shift from 

management strategies that are designed to maximize yield (Longhurst 2006) to those that can 

preserve the natural variations that characterize species and ecosystems.
