RESUMO: Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, é uma planta amplamente 
utilizada na medicina popular no sul do Brasil, Uruguai, Argentina e Paraguai. As características 
tecnológicas do extrato seco por aspersão de Achyrocline satureioides, produzido em escala 
semi-industrial, assim como a viabilidade da produção de granulados são relatadas no 
presente trabalho. O extrato seco por aspersão foi caracterizado como um pó fino, composto 
por pequenas partículas esféricas com superfície rugosa e porosa. O fator de Hausner, índice 
de Carr e o índice de densificação das partículas foram, respectivamente, 1,23, 18,9% e 27,2 
mL, caracterizando-o como um pó com fluxo pobre e de baixa densidade. A preparação dos 
granulados a partir deste extrato seco por aspersão, através do método de desagregação por 
via seca, originou grânulos com forma irregular, superfície rugosa, mas com melhor fluxo e 
melhores características de compactabilidade. Estes grânulos apresentaram fator de Hausner, 
índice de Carr e índice de densificação de 1,09, 8,16% e 12,33 mL, respectivamente. A análise 
por de CLAE dos polifenóis principais quercetina, luteolina e 3-O-metilquercetina revelou 
que o processo de granulação não altera o perfil quantitativo e qualitativo dos constituintes 
inicialmente presentes no extrato seco. A avaliação da estabilidade física do extrato seco por 
aspersão e do granulado, em condições de unidade relativa de 65 e 99%, mostrou uma expressiva 
redução na absorção de umidade dos grânulos quando comparados com o extrato seco.

ABSTRACT: Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, is a herbal specie widely used 
in folk medicine in the south of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. The technological 
characteristics of an Achyrocline satureioides spray dried extract powder, produced in semi-
industrial scale, as well as the feasibility of the granules are reported in the present work. The 
spray dried powder was characterized as a fine powder consisting of small spherical particles 
with rough and porous surface. The Hausner´s factor, Carr’s index, and densification index of the 
spray dried powder were, respectively, 1,23, 18,9%, and 27,2 mL, characterizing it as a poor flow 
and low density powder. The preparation of granules from this spray dried powder, through dry 
disaggregation method, yielded irregularly shaped granules, with a rough surface, but with better 
flow and compactability characteristics. These granules presented a Hausner´s factor, a Carr’s 
index, and a densification index of, respectively, 1,09, 8,16%, and 12,33 mL. The LC assay of 
the main polyphenols, quercetin, luteolin, and 3-O-methylquercetin revealed that the granulation 
process did not changed the quantitative and qualitative profile of these constituents originally 
present in the spray dried powder. The comparative evaluation of the physical stability of both the 
spray dried powder and the granules, under relative humidity conditions of 65% and 99%, showed 
an expressive reduction in the humidity sorption on the granules as compared to the spray dried 
powders.

INTRODUCTION

 Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, 
vegetal specie known as marcela or macela, have a 
wide range of therapeutic uses in the south of Brazil, 

Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay as anti-inflammatory, 
antispasmodic, digestive, sedative, carminative, among 
others (Simões et al., 1998). Although the popular use has 
been traditionally done by oral intake of inflorescences 
infusions, for industrial application the development of

Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae: development of granules from spray dried powder

spray dried powders have been studied (Senna et al., 1997; 
Teixeira, 1996) in order to overcome the main limitation 
of liquid extracts, its low stability. The Achyrocline 
satureioides spray dried powders have presented good 
stability against heat and light (Holzschuh et al., 2007). 
However, the poor properties of flow and compactability 
of the powders, mainly due to the small particle size, low 
density, wide range of granulometric distribution, and 
high hygroscopy have led to important limitations in the 
development of derivative solid pharmaceutical dosage 
forms.
 In an attempt to overcome such limitations, the 
present work was designed to investigate the technological 
feasibility of granules from the spray dried powder. For 
this, the spray dried powder was produced on a semi-
industrial scale and characterized regarding its properties of 
flow and compactability, comparing these properties with 
those presented by the corresponding granules. The main 
polyphenols, quercetin, luteolin, and 3-O-methylquercetin 
were used as reference in the chemical control of the 
process.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Preparation of the spray dried powder (SDP)

 The SDP of the A. satureioides (Lam.) DC., 
Asteraceae, was prepared by maceration of inflorescences 
into a 40% ethanol/water solution in the proportion of 
plant:solvent of 5.2% (w/v). The corresponding extractive 
solution containing 1.03±0.01% (w/v) of dry residue was 
employed to prepare the SDP. The SDP was prepared 
according to the method previously described by Bassani 
and cols. (PI 103468-5, Bassani et al., 2001) and have in 
its composition colloidal silicon dioxide and polysorbate 
80 in a 1:1 ratio in the final product. Briefly, the spray 
drying process was carried out on a semi-industrial scale in 
a Minor Production Spray Dryer Plant equipment (NIRO), 
using the following conditions: feed flow, 160 mL/min; 
inlet air temperature, 175 ºC; outlet air temperature, 100 
ºC, and rotational atomizer speed, 11.000 rpm.

Dry granulation of SDP

Blending of the powders

 Two blends of powder (F1 or F2) were prepared 
through the mixture of SDP with excipients in a cubic-like 
mixer, at 36 rpm, attached to a multiuse motor (Erweka AR 
400). The composition of these formulations is presented 
in the Table 1. For F2 preparation, the SDP and the filler 
material (microcrystalline cellulose) were mixed in a 
cubical mixer, for 15 min, with posterior addition of the 
lubricant (magnesium stearate) and the flow regulator 
(colloidal silicon dioxide), then continuing the operation 
for 5 more min. The F1 formulation was obtained by 

mixture the SDP and the lubricant for a period of 5 min. 
Mixtures of 325 g each formulation were prepared.

Preparation of the slugs

 Slugs of 0.7 g were obtained through direct 
compression of F1 or F2 formulations in a single punch 
compression machine (Korsch EK0), equipped with a 
feeder and simple, circular, faceted punch of 15 mm in 
diameter. The compression machine was regulated by 
lowering the lower punch by 6 mm and by penetrating the 
upper punch by 4 mm. The compression of the formulation 
was carried out through manual operation of the machine.

Preparation of the granules (SDG)

 The granulation of the slugs was performed by 
means of a mechanical granulator (Erweka TGIIS), in 
order to obtain granules of a particle size of less than 2.0 
mm. Then, the granules were submitted to an oscillating 
granulator (Erweka FGS), equipped with 1.0 mm sieve to 
standardize the diameter. The granules in the range of 250 
to 1000 ?m of diameter were selected through the use of 
sieving with 0.250 and 1.0 mm mesh.

satureioides granules.

Analysis of particle size distribution

 This analysis was performed by measuring 
the Feret’s diameter of at least 500 particles by optical 
microscopy, with a calibrated reference scale. The 
magnification employed were, respectively, 3.2x for SDP 
and 10x for SDG.

Bulk and tapped density, hausner’s factor, carr’s index, 
and densification index

 The bulk and tapped densities were determined 
using 10.0 g of each material in a 25 mL graduated cylinder 
(compacting volumeter J. Engelsmann). The values 
obtained from these parameters were used to calculate the 
Hausner’s factor (Hausner, 1967), the Carr’s index (Carr, 
1965), and the densification index (Guyot, 1995).

Angle of repouse (Parthirana &amp;amp; Gupta, 1976)

 The angle of repouse was determined using 
a device consisting of a mobile cylinder, adjusted to

the fixed base and attached to a motor which, when 
activated, separates the cylinder from the base by lifting 
it. The measure was taken directly on the register of the 
powder cone shadows projected onto the plane, and the 
angle of repouse (?) was obtained by calculation of its 
tangent. Thirty milliliters of each sample were used for 
the analysis. The results were expressed by the average of 
three determinations.

Determination of granule friability (Prista, 2003)

 Nearly 40 mL of granules, measured in a 100 mL 
graduated cylinder, were selected using a sieving with mesh 
opening of 0.250 mm. A sample of the fraction retained 
in the sieve, corresponding to 30 mL, was weighed and 
transferred, carefully, to the 100 mL graduated cylinder. 
After having been closed and attached to the friabilometer, 
the mixture was submitted to spinning for 15 min, at 20 
rpm. Then, the sample was once again submitted to the 
initial procedure in view to remove the fine particles. The 
friability was calculated based on the percentage of fine 
particles released.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

 SEM photomicrographies of SDP and SDG 
particles were obtained using a scanning electron 
microscope (Jeol JSM 6060). The samples were set up 
over stubs of aluminum using bi-adhesive tape made of 
carbon and metallized with gold coating, using the Jeol Jee 
4B metallizer (JVG-IN).

Liquid chromatography (LC) analysis

 The three main phenolic constituents, quercetin, 
luteolin, and 3-O-methylquercetin were determined in 
SDP and SDG following the method reported by De Souza 
et al. (2002). For each sample, 500 mg (SPD or SDG) 
were extracted using 50.0 mL of ethyl acetate for 2 h 
under mechanical agitation. The liquid dispersion obtained 
was filtered and the solvent evaporated. The residue was 
dissolved with methanol and transferred to the volumetric 
flask of 25.0 mL. The volume was completed with solvent. 
An aliquot of 2.0 mL of this solution was diluted to 20.0 
mL with a mixture of methanol:water solution (53:47, v/v), 
thus constituting the sample solution. Injections of 20 ?L 
of this solution, in triplicate, were performed. A mixture 
of methanol and aqueous solution of 1% phosphoric acid 
(w/v) in the proportion of 53:47 (v/v) was the elluent, in an 
isocratic system, previously filtered through polyvinylidene 
fluoride membrane and degassed in an ultra-sound bath. 
Chromatographic conditions included: elluent flow of 
0.6 mL/min and detection at 362 nm. The sensibility was 
1.0 AUFS. Each sample SDP or SDG was analyzed in 
triplicate.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Preparation and evaluation of spray dried powders

 The parameters for preparation the spray dried 
powder in a semi-industrial scale (Minor production spray 
dryer plant, NIRO) were selected based on the conditions 
reported by Da Silva (2003), using the same equipment. 
The volume of the extractive solution, submitted to spray 
drying, was 63.0 L, which contained 7.95% (w/w) of 
dry residue (plant constituents plus the excipients). The 
drying process resulted in, approximately, 5.0 kg of SDP, 
characterizing a processing yield of 88%.
 The SDP appeared as a fine yellow powder with 
characteristic odor and tendency to form agglomerates. The 
loss on drying of the SDP was 5.27%±0.01. If we consider 
this result as corresponding to the residual humidity, this 
value is within the limits accepted for powders with non-
hermetic packaging (max 6% to 7%) (List &amp;amp; Schmidt, 
1989), yet above the maximum limit of 4% set for dry 
extracts (Farmacopéia Brasileira, 1988). The particle size 
distribution of SDP (Figure 1) reveals that, approximately, 
50% of the particles present diameters below 13 ?m, 
while, approximately, 90% below 23 ?m, characterizing 
the SDP as a very fine powder (Farmacopéia Brasileira, 
1988). This characteristic of fine powder can be related, 
partially at least, to the use of colloidal silicon dioxide as 
drying excipient, and/or to the low concentration of soluble 
solids in the feed solution (List &amp;amp; Schmidt, 1989; Masters, 
1976).
 The low mean size of the SDP particles (13.09 
?m±3.23) is characteristic of spray dried powders obtained 
from Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, 
extractive solution in similar operational conditions using 
colloidal silicon dioxide as excipient (Lemos Senna, 
1993; Da Silva, 2003). The standard deviation observed, 
higher than 2.0, represents a wide range of particle size 
distribution (Wells, 1988), which can be observed in the 
SDP analysis in Figure 1.
 Table 2 presents the results of the characterization 
of the compactability and the flow of SDP, which 
characterize SDP as a powder with potential problems of 
compactability and non-spontaneous flow due to its stable 
packing. Even the difficulty in determining the angle of 
repouse, characterized by high relative standard deviation, 
corroborates this tendency. The SDP photomicrographies 
(Figure 2) reveal that the particles present spheroidal form 
with porous and rough surface, but of small dimension.
 The LC profile of the major polyphenols, quercetin, 
luteolin, and 3-O-methylquercetin, from SDP is showed 
in the Figure 3, while the corresponding concentration is 
presented in the Table 3.
 In summary, the results demonstrate that the 
spray drying of an A. satureioides extractive solution in 
semi-industrial scale resulted in a powder with excellent 
production yielding. However, the particles presented

small size, porous, and rough surface, characteristics 
which can be related to the poor fl ow and compactability.

Preparation of SDP granules (SDG)

Preparation and characterization of the slugs

 The granules were prepared by compaction 
followed of disaggregation. For compaction, the choice 
of the excipients was based on the results reported by De 
Souza et al. (2005) (F1) and Couto (2000) (F2), who defi ned 
the use of microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, 
and colloidal silicon dioxide as appropriate excipients for 
other herbal derivatives granules (Phyllanthus niruri).
 It is well know that the slugs for granulation 
should present a thickness in the range of 3 to 4 mm 
in view to facilitate the disaggregation process (Prista, 

2003). In this manner, in our tests the average weight 
was adjusted so that the slugs would present a thickness 
within this range and hardness higher than 50 N. This 
value of hardness, higher than that usually set for tablets 
(Farmacopéia Brasileira, 1988), of 30 N, is due to the 
requirement that compact must be able to resist breakage, 
without the loss of large quantities of fi ne powders in the 
granulation process. With this, we were able to obtain 
slugs with average weight of 0.7 g.
 During compaction of the F1 or F2 to obtain 
the slug, an atypical phenomenon was observed, which 
deserves mention. When high penetration of the upper 
punch in the matrix was applied, the compact change its 
color, appearing completely darkened. We also observed 
that when the penetration of the upper punch was 
adjusted to lower deepness, no darkness in the slugs was 
observed. The fi rst hypothesis formulated to explain this 
phenomenon was the degrading of the fl avonoids, and/or 
a possible infl uence of compression excipients (Schreier 
&amp;amp; Miller, 1985). To elucidate these hypothesis, slugs 
with and without color changing were produced using the 
F2 formulation. The analysis of the these slugs, by LC, 
was then performed and signifi cant differences in the 
concentration of the major fl avonoids between the F2 Slug 
(without color changing) and the corresponding darkened 
slugs were found (Table 3). Additionally, in order to check 
the infl uence of the excipients added to the slugs obtention 
in the darkness phenomena, slugs only with SDP in 
absence of any excipient with (SD dark slug) and without 
the presence of darkness (SD slug) were also prepared and 
analyzed. As fi rst observed also in this case, when high 
penetration of the upper punch in the matrix was applied, 
the compact appeared completely darkened. The results of 
the LC evaluation of the major polyphenol concentrations

 The slugs were, therefore, prepared by adjusting 
the penetration of the upper punch in such way as to reach 
the hardness of the slug, which would not cause the color 
change of the material. Thus, the obtained compacts were 
designed, respectively, F1 and F2 slugs. Its technological 
characteristics (Table 4) differ significantly (? = 0.05). 
Despite no quality specifications are available for slugs 
produced by dry granulation, the technological assessment 
allows a comparative analysis of their characteristics from 
the different formulations. For this reason, in this study 
specification for tablets was referred for comparison. The 
differences observed between the average weights of F1 
and F2 slugs, although statistically significant, can be 
considered acceptable under the technological point of 
view. In any case, these can be attributed to the difference 
of flow and filling of the compression chamber between F1 
and F2.
 The F1 formulation resulted in slugs with 
deformation characteristics which became the evaluation of 
its hardness and friability not possible. The characteristics 
of deformation of F1 slugs resulted in extremely high values 
of hardness. The compact did not break during the hardness 
test, the material when crushed, became deformed causing 
ruptures only in their centers. Maintaining the crushing 
force until the maximum limit of the hardness tester, the 
final value was extremely high. Thus, the value presented 
in Table 4 expresses the force applied at the moment that 

(Table 3) demonstrate that the slugs containing only SDP, 
without color changing, presented no significant difference 
(? = 0.05) among the phenolics concentration compared to 
that in correspondent slugs with color change; therefore, 
it can be inferred that the darkness of the slugs was not 
determined by the flavonoid degradation, neither by the 
presence of the excipients The concentration of phenolics 
in the slug takes into account only the amount of SDP, 
disregarding the excipients that compose the slugs.
 Although this is not the main focus of the present 
work, we cannot fail to mention the observations made 
by Smith and his collaborators (Smith et al., 2000), who, 
upon studying the photostability of some polyphenols, 
among them luteolin and quercetin, confirmed that after 
exposing these to luminous radiation, it was possible to 
observe changes in their coloration due to modifications in 
their reflectances. The yellow coloration of the quercetin 
is lost quickly, while the coloration of the luteolin become 
blackening. The authors attribute such modifications to the 
probable formation of molecular aggregates with changing 
the ?max to higher wavelengths than those presented by 
non-aggregated polyphenols. In the present work, it is not 
possible to establish a relationship between the presence 
of aggregates and the interaction of the excipients in the 
SDP. Further investigations to enlighten this phenomenon 
in a complex matrix as an herbal powder are running in our 
Laboratory.

the fi rst fracture in the slugs appeared.
 The results obtained in the assessment of friability 
of the F1 slugs were also atypical. After the analysis 
time had lapsed, the slugs presented an increase in their 
weight. The test was repeated three times with similar 
results. A plausible explanation for such phenomenon is 
the hygroscopy of the SDP since this can be found in a 
proportion of 99% (w/w) in the slugs. The friability test of 
the F2 slugs did not presented this phenomenon, and showed 
that the resistance to the abrasion is below the maximum 
limit allowed for tablets (Farmacopéia Brasileira, 1988), 
whose accepted value is the maximum loss of 1.5% (w/w) 
of its weight.
 The F1 slugs presented disintegration time of 39 
min, value above the maximum limit (30 min) specifi ed 
for tablets (Farmacopéia Brasileira, 1988). In contrast, the 
F2 slugs is within the set limits, difference which can be 
related to the presence of microcrystalline cellulose in F2 
(Kibbe, 2000; Hoepfner et al., 2002; The United States 
Pharmacopoeia, 2008). The concentration of the major 
fl avonoids in the F2 slugs is presented in Table 3.
 Taken together, the characteristics presented by 
the F2 slugs determined its selection for the next step of dry 
granulation.

Granulation and characterization of the granules

 The yield of the granulation process was 60%. 
Despite the low F2 slug friability, the granulation process 
presented a larger production of fi ne powders, characteristic 
already reported for other herbal products (De Souza et al., 
2005; Couto et al., 2000).
 The average size of the granules obtained from F2 
slugs (SDG) was 1.19 mm±0.31. The analysis of the particle 
size distribution of the SDG (Figure 4) allows observing 
that more than 90% of the particles presented diameters 

within the range of 0.7 to 1.7 mm, while approximately 
58% presented diameters between 0.7 and 1.3 mm.
 As regards the technological parameters, in an 
overview, the granules presented better compactability 
and fl ow characteristics than those of the SDP (Table 2). 
In addition, lower values of bulk and tapped densities 
were observed due to the increase in the particle size, 
overcoming one of the main limitations of SDP.
 The Hausner’s factor observed (1.089) indicates 
a better packing stability of the granules in comparison to 
those of the SDP (1.234). The value of the compressibility 
index (Carr’s index) (8.16) shows an improvement in the 
fl ow properties of the SDG as compared to that of the SDP 
(18.93). Carr’s index values of above 15% characterize 
materials presenting poor fl owability and problems in the 
packing, which is the case of SDP and other herbal spray 
dried powders (Couto et al., 2000; Augsburger &amp;amp; Vuppala, 
1997; Summers &amp;amp; Aulton, 2002).
 The densifi cation index, which for the SDP is 
higher than 20 mL, characterize it as being a material with 
potential limitations in packing during the compression 
process (Guyot et al., 1995). The granulation of SDP 
caused a signifi cant improvement in this characteristic 
(SDG; 12.3 mL).
 Regarding the angle of repouse, in a fi rst view, 
the results observed for the SDG and SDP (below 30o) 
would characterize both as free fl ow materials. However, 
the fl ow of SDP occurs in blocks, differently of the SDG, 
which presents a regular fl ow.
 The friability of the granules was 7.35% (w/w). 
When compared with the friability of the slugs from which 
it was originated (0.17%), can be observed an increase, 
most likely due to the disaggregation process. The loss 
of drying of the SDG was 5.72% (w/w). Bearing in mind 
this value as the residual humidity, this parameter can be 
considered to be within the defi ned limit for packaged 
powders in non-hermetic containers (List &amp;amp; Schmidt, 
1989).

(Figure 5c and 5d), can be observed structures with rounded 
extremities, whose form remained unchanged even after 
the stages of compaction and disaggregation. The presence 
of microcrystalline cellulose fibers is also observed.
 The polyphenol LC analysis of the granules 
reveals the presence of peaks with retention times identical 
to those presented in the SDP (Figure 3). However, they 
are in lower intensity due to the presence of excipients. 
The corresponding concentrations in the SDG are showed 
in Table 3. No additional peaks were observed in the 
chromatogram, denoting the absence of degradation 
product detectable by the employed chromatographic 
system.
 The exposure of SDP and SDG to environments 
with relative humidity of 65% and 99% demonstrated 
that both are sensitive to the humidity (Figure 6). As can 
be verified, the SDP exposed to the relative humidity of 
65% presented rapid increase in weight over the first 24 
h, absorbing approximately 10.20% (w/w) of its weight 
in water and progressing in a lower proportion in the 
subsequent hours until reaching stability. Likewise, when 
submitted to the relative humidity of 99%, the initial 
increase was very quick, considering that in the first 24 h 
it absorbed 24.36% (w/w) of its weight in water. In both 
relative humidities, the presence of agglomerates was 
observed in the SDP at the end of 11 d. The SDG presented 
lower absorption of humidity in both environments of 
relative humidity of 65% and 99%, absorbing, respectively, 
7.64% (w/w) and 20.84% (w/w) of its weight in water, over 
the first 24 h. After this period, there was a tendency for the 
stability of absorption of humidity in both environments 
of relative humidity. This lower absorption of humidity 
presented by SDG can be mainly related to the lesser 
surface area exposed to the atmosphere, without ruled out 
the role of the excipients within the formulation (De Souza 
et al., 2005; Miller, 1997; Ansel et al., 2000). As regards 
the sensorial characteristics, neither the SDP nor the SDG 
presented changes in coloration in the relative humidity 
environment of 65%. However, in the 99% relative 
humidity environment, the both powders became brown. 
Studies above the stability of A. satureioides powder and 
its major flavonoids against ambiental conditions were 
performed by Holzschuh et al. (2007) and corroborate with 
our results. In this study the instability of these flavonoids 
was evaluated, especially under stress conditions (90% 
relative humidity and temperature of 50 oC), but the 
elucidation of the degradation and oxidation products still 
has to be enlightened.

CONCLUSIONS

 The A. satureioides (Lam.) DC., Asteraceae, spray 
dried powder was prepared in semi-industrial scale, from 
40% ethanol extractive solution, with an excellent yield 
in the spray drying process (88%). Nevertheless, its flow 
and compactability characteristics were not appropriate 

for the preparation of derivative pharmaceutical forms, 
especially by direct compression. The granulation of the 
spray dried powder allowed the obtaining of the granule, 
whose technological characteristics as Hausner’s factor, 
the Carr’s index, and the densification index revealed more 
favorable properties.
 In summary this first report on the preparation 
of granules from Achyrocline satureioides spray dried 
powders demonstrated, besides its feasibility, that the 
granules presented better technological characteristics, 
overcoming one of the main limitations of SDP.
 Moreover, the results open several investigative 
perspectives in view to optimize the product and to 
enlighten the darkness phenomenon observed when high 
compression forces were employed.
