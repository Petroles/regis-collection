resumo 
 

 

Sendo os fármacos compostos biologicamente ativos, a sua presença 
nos recursos hídricos tem gerado preocupações devido aos efeitos adversos em 
organismos não-alvo. Sendo os tratamentos convencionais, aplicados nas 
estações de tratamento de águas residuais (ETARs), ineficientes para a 
remoção destes contaminantes, as ETARs são apontadas como a principal fonte 
de fármacos no meio ambiente. O processo de adsorção, enquanto tratamento 
avançado para a remoção de fármacos da água, em particular com o uso de 
carvões ativados (CAs), tem-se mostrado um processo de fácil aplicação e 
eficiente, sem formação de subprodutos. 

Como a produção de CAs pode ser um processo dispendioso, devido 
aos requisitos energéticos e ao uso de precursores de elevado custo, a 
alternativa pirólise em micro-ondas (MO) de lama primária (LP) da indústria 
papeleira pode ser uma solução promissora, contribuindo simultaneamente para 
a valorização de resíduos industriais. Neste trabalho, os CAs foram produzidos 
por pirólise em MO de LP impregnada com KOH (agente ativante) durante 10 
min a 800 W, lavados com ácido clorídrico e crivados para obtenção da fração 
de partículas com dimensão inferior ou igual a 180 µm. Obtiveram-se diferentes 
CAs alterando as razões de agente ativante:precursor, nomeadamente 0.5:1, 
1:1 e 1.5:1. Os CAs produzidos foram física e quimicamente caraterizados. No 
sentido de avaliar o desempenho dos CAs produzidos, realizaram-se testes de 
adsorção em descontínuo com água ultra-pura para determinar a percentagem 
de adsorção do anti-epilético carbamazepina (CBZ). O efeito da concentração 
de CA e o efeito do tempo de contacto também foram testados. 

Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que, de um modo geral, os CAs 
produzidos numa razão de 0.5:1 de agente ativante:precursor apresentaram 
áreas superficiais específicas (SBET) entre 773 e 1190 m2/g e elevadas 
percentagens de remoção de CBZ de soluções de água ultra-pura, acima de 80 
%, para concentrações de CA de 0.1 g/L e tempos de contacto de 24 h. Os CAs 
produzidos em laboratório demonstraram ter uma estrutura porosa mais 
desenvolvida do que o CA comercial de referência e SBET comparáveis. Todavia, 
para as mesmas condições experimentais, diferentes lotes de produção 
originaram CAs com propriedades e desempenhos diferentes, denotando que 
mais trabalho de investigação deve ser investido de modo a otimizar o seu 
processo de produção, tornando-o repetível.

abstract 

 
The presence of pharmaceuticals in water bodies, being biologically 

active compounds, have raised concerns due to the adverse effects in non-target 
organisms. With the conventional treatments, applied in the wastewater 
treatment plants (WWTPs), being inefficient for the removal of these 
contaminants, WWTPs are pointed out as the main source of pharmaceuticals 
into the environment. The use of adsorption, as an advanced treatment for the 
removal of pharmaceuticals from water, in particular by using activated carbons 
(ACs), has shown to be an easy-handling and cost-efficient process, without sub-
products formation. 

Since the production of ACs can be an expensive process, due to the 
high energy requirements and the use of expensive precursors, the alternative 
microwave (MW) pyrolysis of paper mill primary sludge (PS) can be a promising 
solution, contributing simultaneously for industrial waste valorisation. In the 
scope of this work, ACs were produced by MW pyrolysis of PS impregnated in 
KOH (activating agent) for 10 min at 800 W, washed with hydrochloric acid and 
sieved to obtain the fraction of particles with a size up to 180 µm. Different ACs 
were obtained by changing activating agent:precursor ratios, namely 0.5:1, 1:1 
and 1.5:1. The produced ACs were physico-chemically characterised. In order to 
assess the performance of the produced ACs, batch adsorption experiments 
were performed with ultra-pure water to determine the adsorption percentages 
of the anti-epileptic carbamazepine (CBZ). The effect of AC dosage and the 
effect of contact time were also tested. 

The obtained results have shown that, overall, the ACs produced with 
an activating agent:precursor ratio of 0.5:1 presented specific surface areas 
(SBET) between 773 and 1190 m2/g and high percentages of CBZ removed from 
ultra-pure water solutions, above 80 %, for AC dosages of 0.1 g/L and a contact 
time of 24 h. The lab-made ACs have shown a more developed porous structure 
than the reference commercial AC and comparable SBET. Nevertheless, under 
the same experimental conditions, different production batches resulted in ACs 
with different properties and performances, highlighting that further research 
work is required to optimise its production process, making it repeatable.

1.1. WATER CONTAMINATION BY EMERGING CONTAMINANTS: THE 
PROBLEMATIC OF PHARMACEUTICALS 

Pharmaceuticals are biologically active agents designed to induce physiological 

responses in humans or animals (Calisto, 2011; Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Klatte et al., 

2017; Vasquez et al. 2014). These organic compounds are synthesized for the prevention, 

treatment and reduction of diseases symptoms, which contributes for the improvement of 

health and quality of life. The continuous and increasingly consumption of pharmaceuticals 

worldwide is related to factors such as population growth, increase of life expectancy, 

population ageing, increase of chronical diseases, development of new and less expensive 

drugs, to name a few (Calisto, 2011; Jelic et al., 2012; Kalaji &amp;amp; Rastogi, 2017; OECD, 2015). 

After ingestion, pharmaceuticals are not completely metabolised by the human or 

animal organism, and are excreted as unchanged substances (parent compounds) or 

transformed products (metabolites) (Calisto, 2011; Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Rivera-

Utrilla et al., 2013). Pharmaceuticals excreted by humans or animals, in their original or 

metabolised form, follow different pathways as illustrated in Figure 1. Human excreted 

medicines, usually pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) before they enter 

into the environment. Unused or expired medications are also inappropriately disposed 

into sinks/toilets or trash containers, ending up going to WWTPs or to landfills, respectively. 

In what concerns veterinary medicine, excreted pharmaceuticals are more likely to enter 

directly into the environment through soil and/or water contamination without a prior 

treatment at a WWTP (Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Khetan &amp;amp; Collins, 2007; Klatte et al., 

2017; Kümmerer, 2001; Li et al., 2015; Ternes et al., 2004; Vasquez et al., 2014; Wang &amp;amp; 

Wang, 2016; Wilkinson et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2008). Regardless of their degree of 

metabolization, excreted compounds can continue to be transformed by biotic and abiotic 

processes (by physico-chemical reactions such as oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis) in 

both WWTPs and receiving water bodies (Halling-Sorensen et al., 1998; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 

2013; Vasquez et al., 2014; Verlicchi et al., 2012; Wilkinson et al., 2017). Pharmaceuticals 

may be referred to as emerging contaminants (ECs), since they are degradation-resistant  

synthetic or natural compounds, that are still unregulated in what concerns environmental

allowed levels, and have the potential to cause adverse effects to non-target organisms, 

including humans (Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; Wilkinson et 

al., 2016).  

 

 

Figure 1. Pathways for the entrance of pharmaceuticals into the environment (adapted from Calisto, 2011) 

 

WWTPs are designed to remove regulated contaminants such as pathogens, organic 

and inorganic compounds (in concentrations at mg/L range), by primary and secondary 

treatments, in order to meet the effluent quality standards for its disposal into the water 

bodies (Bolong et al., 2009; Deblonde et al., 2011; Jelic et al., 2012; Verlicchi et al., 2012). 

Nevertheless, WWTPs are considered to be the main point sources of pharmaceuticals into 

the environment, since the conventional treatments are inefficient to remove ECs from the 

wastewaters, which results in their discharge and contamination of aquatic and terrestrial 

ecosystems (Bolong et al., 2009; Jelic et al., 2012; Klatte et al., 2017; Petrie et al., 2015; 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

5 

Petrovi? et al., 2003; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013). Tertiary treatments are optional and more 

expensive processes, that can be applied at WWTPs in order to improve the quality of the 

discharged effluent. These advanced treatments can be chemical, biological and physical 

processes (also addressed as phase-changing processes) (Jelic et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2014; 

Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; Wang &amp;amp; Wang, 2016). Advanced oxidation processes (AOP), 

membrane processes, biological processes and adsorption onto activated carbon (AC), are 

commonly addressed in literature as promising solutions to remove ECs from water, 

including pharmaceuticals (Bo et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2014; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; 

Wang &amp;amp; Wang, 2016). 

Due to the development of analytical methodologies, pharmaceuticals were 

detected in the environment as complex mixtures of several different classes of 

pharmaceuticals, in their transformed or original form. Some of the detected classes 

include analgesics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, diuretics, beta-blockers, anti-

hypertensive, hormones, psychiatric, anti-histamines, anti-epileptics and lipid regulators, 

which even in small quantities (ng to µg/L range) can adversely impact ecosystems (Calisto, 

2011; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017; Vasquez et al., 2014). Klatte 

et al. (2017) highlight the problem of disease resistance to pharmaceuticals due to the 

exposure to low concentration of ECs and warn about the low levels at which hormones 

start having effects. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2014) also points out the 

problem related to antibiotic resistance, since the projections indicate that, in the future, 

even infections from small injuries may lead to death. The presence of pharmaceuticals in 

drinking water does not exceed trace levels (ng/L), so they would not cause an acute 

reaction (Klatte et al., 2017; Kümmerer, 2001; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Wilkinson et al., 

2016, 2017), however it increases the possibility of potential impacts due to a cumulative 

effect and life-cycle exposures (Gaffney et al., 2016; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013; Vasquez et 

al., 2014; Wilkinson et al., 2016). 

Carbamazepine (CBZ), the pharmaceutical studied under the scope of this work, is 

an anti-epileptic used for the treatment of mental disorders whose molecular structure is 

illustrated in Figure 2. It is a commonly detected pharmaceutical in WWTPs and surface 

waters due to high ingestion levels (around 1000 mg per patient per day) and its high

recalcitrance to the conventional wastewater treatments (Bahlmann et al., 2014; Brezina 

et al., 2017; Donner et al., 2013; Jelic et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2008). 

 

 

Figure 2. Molecular structure of CBZ 

 

CBZ is highly metabolised by the liver, presenting metabolites as biologically active 

as the parent compound (Bahlmann et al., 2014; Jelic et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2008). 

Biological treatments at WWTPs are associated to the conversion of CBZ metabolites into 

their original forms, which can be related to higher concentrations of parent compound in 

the effluent when compared to the influent (Luo et al., 2014). It is known that CBZ is 

responsible to harmfully impact aquatic ecosystems, including invertebrates, fish and algae 

(Brezina et al., 2017), being crucial to develop feasible processes for its removal. 

 

1.2. REMOVAL OF PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CONTAMINATED WATER BY 
ADSORPTION ONTO ACTIVATED CARBONS 

1.2.1. BASIC DESCRIPTION OF THE ADSORPTION PROCESS 

Adsorption is a surface phenomenon, which consists of the accumulation of 

particles (atoms, ions or molecules) on a surface or interface, when it occurs between two 

distinct physical states of matter such as liquid-solid, gas-solid or gas-liquid interfaces. The 

adsorbed component is the adsorbate, while the material in which particles are 

concentrated is referred as the adsorbent (De Gisi et al., 2016; Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 

1972). Only adsorption between liquid-solid interfaces will be focused, since this work, as 

described below, is aimed to study the adsorptive removal of pharmaceuticals from water 

by using AC.

pharmaceuticals from water

Since the adsorbate can be polar or non-polar and neutral or electrically charged, 

the adsorption process can occur due to electrostatic attraction, Van der Waals attraction 

or by covalent bond (Jaria, 2014; Weber Jr., 1972). Adsorption processes based on 

electrostatic interaction, also called exchange adsorption, result from the concentration of 

ions on charged sites of the adsorbent where they remain fixed. When results from weaker 

interactions, such as Van der Waals interactions, adsorption is considered to be physical, 

physisorption. If the adsorbate interacts with the adsorbent through stronger interactions, 

such as covalent bonds, the adsorption process is known as chemisorption. Physisorption, 

as opposed to chemisorption, is a reversible process, making it suitable for 

separation/extraction methods (De Gisi et al., 2016; Weber Jr., 1972).  

Molecules accumulate onto a solid surface until the amount of solute in the solution 

reaches a dynamic equilibrium with the amount of solute adsorbed onto the adsorbent, 

that is, when the number of adsorbed and desorbed molecules is equal. In the equilibrium, 

the amount of solute concentrated onto the adsorbent as a function of the adsorbate’s 

concentration, at constant temperature, can be described by an adsorption isotherm, as 

shown in Figure 3 (Bansal &amp;amp; Goyal, 2005; De Gisi et al., 2016; Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 

1972). It expresses qe as a function of Ce where, qe is the adsorption capacity, that is, the 

amount of adsorbed solute per unit of mass of adsorbent at the equilibrium (mg/g) and Ce 

is the concentration of solute in solution at the equilibrium (mg/L). A higher value of qe 

represents a more efficient adsorption, that is, more solute is accumulated onto the solid 

surface, resulting in a lower concentration of adsorbate in the solution (De Gisi et al., 2016; 

Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972). The adsorption of solute molecules onto the surface of 

an adsorbent may occur in single or multimolecular layers. Langmuir, Brunauer-Emmett-

Teller (BET) and Freundlich are some adsorption models that can be used to describe this 

accumulation process (Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972).

The adsorption process is influenced by factors related to the adsorbate/adsorbent 

properties and operating conditions, as identified in Figure 4 (Ferreira, 2017; Luo et al., 

2014; Mansour et al., 2017; Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972), that are decisive for the 

removal of contaminants, including pharmaceuticals.

pharmaceutical uptake was determined by the adsorbent surface chemistry. Mestre et al. 

(2014) referred the effect of the adsorbate molecular size on the adsorption process, in 

which the physically activated adsorbent presented the appropriate textural properties to 

adsorb the pharmaceutical with higher molecular weight. Bolong et al. (2009) addressed 

the competition for the same adsorption active sites and/or pore blocking, which could 

reduce the rate of adsorption and/or imply the use of a higher dosage of adsorbent (Bolong 

et al., 2009; Snoeyink, 1990). Considering the complexity of the adsorption process, only 

some factors that affect the adsorption mechanism were briefly described.  

Being a surface process, adsorption is favoured by adsorbents with high specific 

surface area (SBET) and well-developed porosity (Hesas et al.; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; 

Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017). According to their nature, adsorbents may be 

carbonaceous, such as AC, graphite and carbon nanotubes, or non-carbonaceous, like clay 

and silica (Akhtar et al., 2016; Baccar et al., 2012; Mansour et al., 2017; Rodriguez-Narvaez 

et al., 2017). In the context of this work, only carbon-based adsorbents, namely ACs, will 

be addressed. 

The adsorbate solubility is a determining factor, since a low solubility in the aqueous 

solution induces higher adsorption (Weber Jr., 1972). The octanol-water partitioning 

coefficient (Kow) is related to the interaction of a solute with the adsorbent. In aqueous 

solutions, high values of Kow are associated with adsorbates with lower affinity for water 

and therefore, a higher adsorption capacity. Contrarily, solutes with low Kow preferably 

remain in the liquid phase due to their higher affinity for water and therefore, are less 

available to adsorb (Kushwaha et al., 2013; Mansour et al., 2017).  Considering the particle 

size, adsorbates with a higher molecular weight, usually, tend to have lower uptake rates 

by microporous adsorbents, due to a limited access to the active sites of the adsorbent 

(Snoeyink, 1990; Weber Jr., 1972).  

The pH value is an important factor since it determines the ionization degree of the 

adsorbate in solution and the surface charge of the adsorbent, influencing the interactions 

between them (Kushwaha et al., 2013; Weber Jr., 1972). The point of zero charge (PZC) is 

related to the pH value at which the adsorbent surface charge is neutral (pH = pHpzc). 

Positively charged adsorbents can be related to surface protonation (in acidic media) when 



Chapter 1: Introduction

pH &amp;lt;pHpzc. The presence of basic surface functional groups also contributes for a net of 

positive charge at the adsorbent surface. In alkaline media, the negatively charged 

adsorbent surface is caused by the ionization of acidic functional groups when pH &gt; pHpzc 

(Bansal &amp;amp; Goyal, 2005; Kushwaha et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2014; Mansour et al., 2017; 

Moreno-Castilla, 2004).  

 

1.2.2. ACTIVATED CARBON: DEFINITIONS AND APPLICATIONS 

ACs, also called solid sponges, are the most commonly used adsorbents due to their 

ability to cope with a great diversity of different molecules, organic and inorganic 

contaminants, of different sizes  (De Gisi et al., 2016; Foo &amp;amp; Hameed, 2010; Peláez-Cid et 

al., 2012). ACs are characterised by a system of micropores, SBET and a surface chemistry, 

which are the basis for their adsorption capacity. Because of their high adsorption capacity, 

ideal for small molecules, their applications include air purification, water treatment, 

colour, odour and taste removal (Jaria, 2014; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; Sarici-Ozdemir &amp;amp; Onal, 

2016; Yahya et al. , 2015).  Commercial AC can be obtained from several carbonaceous 

sources such as coal, lignite, wood and bones (Mansour et al., 2017; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; 

Weber Jr., 1972). It is commonly produced as powder AC or granular AC, being the main 

difference the particle’s size and, subsequently, their distinct applications. Regarding the 

size, the powder form has a dimension smaller than 0.1 mm, while granules comprise sizes 

between 0.6 and 4.0 mm (Bansal &amp;amp; Goyal, 2005; Mansour et al., 2017). AC is mainly 

composed by carbon, conventionally between 85 and 95 % for commercial AC, being the 

remaining components oxygen, hydrogen, sulphur, nitrogen and inorganic ash. The 

amounts of these elements depends on the precursor and production  process (Bansal &amp;amp; 

Goyal, 2005). The ACs SBET can range between 500 and 3000 m2/g (Jaria, 2014; Peláez-Cid 

et al., 2012; Weber Jr., 1972). 

ACs adsorptive properties result from the thermal transformation of a 

carbonaceous raw material, in which pores are formed due to the loss of volatile 

compounds and the random rearrangement of the carbon structure. The adsorption 

capacity improvement relies not only in the surface chemistry of the material, but also on 

the ACs internal surface (Jaria, 2014; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; Weber Jr., 1972).  



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

11 

The internal surface is related to the well-developed porous structure of the AC, 

which indeed is the reason for its designation as activated (Jaria, 2014). According to the 

International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), pores can be classified as 

micropores, mesopores and macropores if they are smaller than 2 nm, between 2 and 50 

nm, and bigger than 50 nm, respectively (IUPAC, 2014). A system of pores with different 

sizes and shapes, randomly distributed, contributes for the increase of the area available 

for adsorption, in which meso and macropores act as transport channels, allowing the 

adsorbate to access to micropores (Calisto et al., 2015; Jaria, 2014; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; 

Weber Jr., 1972).   

Regarding the chemical surface, ACs are composed by functional groups chemically 

bonded at the edges of the crystalline structure. The basicity of the AC surface is provided 

by functional groups such as carbonyls, chromenes, and pyrones, while the carboxylic 

groups, lactones, phenols and anhydrides (oxygen-based groups) are responsible for the 

surface acidic behaviour. Other groups such as hydroxyl, ether, quinone and anhydride can 

be found at the carbon surface (Foo &amp;amp; Hameed, 2012b, 2012a; Hesas et al., 2013; Yahya et 

al., 2015), as shown in Figure 5. The presence of these acidic and basic groups affects the 

surface charges and the adsorbate/adsorbent interactions (Akhtar et al., 2016; Jaria, 2014; 

Kushwaha et al., 2013; Yahya et al., 2015). Additionally, the reactivity of these functional 

groups allows the surface functionalization of the ACs (Jaria, 2014).

Chapter 1: Introduction 

12 

Available literature has pointed out the adsorption of pharmaceuticals onto AC as 

an attracting solution, highlighting advantages such as non-formation of by-products, 

versatility, good removal efficiency (at low concentrations of contaminants), low 

operational energy, non-selectivity and possibility for regeneration/reuse (Álvarez-

Torrellas et al., 2016; Antunes et al., 2012; Calisto et al., 2017; Mansour et al., 2017; Mestre 

et al., 2014; Sotelo et al., 2014). Nonetheless, these adsorbents are not widely used due to 

their high costs (De Gisi et al., 2016; Mansour et al., 2017) and because contaminants are 

not mineralised (Pereira, 2017; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 2017). 

 

1.2.3. PRODUCTION OF ACTIVATED CARBON 

ACs porous structure, SBET and surface chemistry, are highly influenced by the 

production process, that is, carbonaceous starting materials, carbonisation, activation and 

operating conditions (Hesas et al., 2013; Jaria, 2014; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; Wahi et al., 

2017; Weber Jr., 1972). 

The production of ACs combines the carbonisation of a starting carbonaceous 

material with an activation process, that can be applied before, during or after 

carbonisation. Carbonisation is the thermal degradation (around 800 °C) of the precursor 

organic fraction, that is, the elimination of most of the non-carbon species, such as oxygen, 

hydrogen and nitrogen, released as gaseous and liquid by-products. The remaining 

elemental carbon forms a rigid carbon skeleton, composed of aromatic irregularly arranged 

structures and a rudimental porous structure (small and closed pores). In that sense, an 

amorphous, lower density material is formed, exhibiting similar characteristics to the 

starting material. Carbonisation is also referred to as pyrolysis, when it is carried out in an 

inert atmosphere (oxygen-free), provided by gases such as nitrogen (N2, commonly used) 

or argon, which also lead to a good porosity development. The activation of the 

carbonaceous structure, which can be physical or chemical, promotes the porosity 

development by creating new pores, unblocking obstructed pores, enlarging and/or 

merging the existing pores (Hesas et al., 2013; Jaria, 2014; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; Wahi et 

al., 2017; Weber Jr., 1972).   



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

13 

In the physical or thermal activation, the AC is produced in two distinct phases: 

carbonisation and then activation. Carbonisation takes place in an inert atmosphere at 

temperatures that can vary from 400 to 950 °C. The resulting carbon structure is then 

activated, that is, pores are enlarged through a partial oxidation (gasification process) in an 

oxidizing atmosphere of air, steam (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) or a combination of these 

gases at temperatures ranging from 800 to 1100 °C (Jaria, 2014; Mansour et al., 2017; 

Peláez-Cid et al., 2012).   

In the chemical activation, carbonisation and activation (usually) occur 

simultaneously. The precursor is impregnated with solutions of phosphoric acid (H3PO4), 

nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), zinc chloride 

(ZnCl2) or potassium carbonate (K2CO3), to name a few activating agents, dried at 100 - 120 

°C (or used as a paste, slurry), and then pyrolysed at temperatures between 400 and 800 

°C. Activating agents differ in relation to the shape and size of the generated pores (since 

they act as template) and the nature of the functional groups added onto the AC surface, 

which is also related to the activating agent:precursor ratio. After the activation process, 

ACs need to be washed in order to remove residual activating agent and unblock obstructed 

pores. Some environmental disadvantages include the corrosiveness and hazardousness of 

activating agents, metal contamination (Jaria, 2014; Mansour et al., 2017; Peláez-Cid et al., 

2012) and eutrophication potential caused by the presence of phosphorous (Mestre et al., 

2011). Under these circumstances, K2CO3 is highlighted as being one of the most 

environmentally friendly chemical activating agent (Peláez-Cid et al., 2012).  

Chemical activation provides ACs with a higher SBET, lower energy demands, higher 

control of the pore size distribution and shorter activation times when compared to 

physical activation. However, the latter stands out for being cheaper, free from corrosive 

reagents and with no impurities coming from the activating agent (Jaria, 2014; Peláez-Cid 

et al., 2012).

1.2.4. THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE PRECURSORS FOR ACTIVATED CARBON PRODUCTION 

In the past few years, more attention has been given to the use of lignocellulosic 

materials for the production of AC, such as fruit peels/shells/stones, wood, grape bagasse, 

sisal, cork and cereal wastes, to name a few (Antunes et al., 2012; De Gisi et al., 2016; 

Mestre et al., 2011, 2014; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; Yahya et al., 2015). At a given point, these 

sources of biomass acted as a carbon dioxide sequester and their energy content resulted 

from solar radiation storage during the photosynthesis process, in which carbon dioxide 

and water were converted into oxygen and carbonaceous sources, including simple sugars, 

lipids and polymers such as starch, proteins, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin (Peláez-Cid 

et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010). The use of these starting materials aroused interest due to 

their renewable nature, high carbon content, low cost and their large abundance, making 

them more affordable than the commercial AC precursors (obtained from expensive and/or 

non-renewable sources) (Ahmed &amp;amp; Theydan, 2014a; Jaria, 2014; Kushwaha et al., 2013; 

Mansour et al., 2017; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; Yahya et al., 2015). The expensiveness of the 

ACs includes factors such as the starting material source, the high energy requirements for 

the production/regeneration process, costs related to the activation process and low 

production yields (Calisto et al., 2015; Peláez-Cid et al., 2012; Rodriguez-Narvaez et al., 

2017).  

Besides agricultural precursors, the production of ACs from industrial wastes can be 

favourable from both economic and environmental point of view. In the context of the 

present work, paper mill primary sludge (PS), a waste derived from treatment of the 

effluents generated by the paper mill industry, was used for AC production purposes. 

Paper mill industry operates with large amounts of fresh water, generating high 

volumes of effluents that require a prior treatment to assure the effluent quality standards 

before its disposal into water bodies (Adhikari &amp;amp; Bhattacharyya, 2015; Pervaiz &amp;amp; Sain, 2015; 

Soucy et al., 2014). PS is a carbon-rich waste, mainly composed by cellulose, hemicellulose 

and lignin, that results from flocculation/sedimentation operations applied during a 

primary treatment. Then, the effluent is subjected to a biological treatment, in which the 

organic matter is degraded by the action of microorganism, from which biological sludge 

(BS) is obtained (Adhikari &amp;amp; Bhattacharyya, 2015; Buruberri et al., 2015; Calisto et al., 2014; 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

15 

Pervaiz &amp;amp; Sain, 2015; Soucy et al., 2014). Paper mill industry is responsible for the 

production of significant amounts of sludge, around 45 kg of dry sludge per ton of paper 

produced (Adhikari &amp;amp; Bhattacharyya, 2015; Soucy et al., 2014). With an annual production 

higher than 200 000 tons, sludge was pointed out as being the major fraction of solid waste 

produced in the Portuguese mills from 2014 to 2016 (CELPA, 2016).  

The cruciality in reducing the volume of waste and the development of valorisation 

measures, in order to avoid landfilling, have been emphasised by the Waste Framework 

Directive (2008/98/EC) (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 

2008). Paper mill solid wastes are commonly landfilled, incinerated (for energy recovery) 

and used for agricultural purposes. Landfilling has been reducing over time and is 

discouraged due to environmental impacts (Buruberri et al., 2015; Monte et al., 2009; 

Pervaiz &amp;amp; Sain, 2015). To tackle with the high amounts of paper mill sludge, some waste 

management/valorisation measures include its incorporation in building materials, road 

building, composting (Monte et al., 2009), its use as wood adhesive and for biofuels 

production (Pervaiz &amp;amp; Sain, 2015). Moreover, due to its carbonaceous nature, paper mill 

sludge can also be converted into ACs, contributing for the production of a cost-efficient 

adsorbent (Calisto et al., 2014; Jaria et al., 2017; Jiang &amp;amp; Ma, 2011; Namazi et al. , 2015; 

Pervaiz &amp;amp; Sain, 2015). A process in which waste is re-inserted in the production chain and 

used as a secondary raw material for the production of value-added products, is fitted 

within a circular economy context. Contrarily, in a linear economy context, goods are 

produced from primary sources, used and end-of-life products are disposed as useless 

wastes, according to a non-sustainable life cycle (Khalili et al., 2000; Liguori &amp;amp; Faraco, 2016). 

Considering the removal of pharmaceuticals from water, the ACs produced from 

both agricultural (Álvarez-Torrellas et al., 2016; Mestre et al., 2011, 2014) and industrial 

wastes, specifically PS (Jaria et al., 2015, 2018), have shown results regarding SBET, 

adsorption capacity and adsorption kinetics, comparable to those obtained for commercial 

ACs. The AC produced by Jaria et al. (2018) from conventional pyrolysis of PS, has shown to 

be more efficient than the commercial AC to remove pharmaceuticals, even using a low 

dosage of absorbent, presenting a SBET between 1389 and 1627 m2/g and a removal 

capacity around 78 % (overnight shaking at 80 rpm, 25 °C and an AC dosage of 0.015 g/L).

1.3. MICROWAVE PYROLYSIS: AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL PYROLYSIS 
FOR ACTIVATED CARBON PRODUCTION 

Microwave (MW) heating is a thermochemical process in which the heat is 

produced by electromagnetic waves (frequency ranging from 300 MHz to 300 GHz). 

Overall, published studies address the production of ACs by MW pyrolysis in 2.45 GHz 

adapted domestic MWs (Foo &amp;amp; Hameed, 2012c; Jones et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010).  

In the conventional pyrolysis in a muffle furnace, samples are heated by conduction 

and convection mechanisms, from an external source, occurring a temperature gradient 

from the hot surface to the interior of the particle (Ahmed &amp;amp; Theydan, 2014b; Ania et al., 

2005; Foo &amp;amp; Hameed, 2012c; Hesas et al., 2013; Wahi et al., 2017). Since precursors with 

different sizes and shapes are not uniformly heated during conventional heating, the 

release of the volatile compounds (gas diffusion) is not so effective, which can compromise 

the AC properties (Ahmed &amp;amp; Theydan, 2014b; Yang et al., 2010). Moreover, non-uniform 

heating requires higher heating times and energy inputs, and may also generate hotspots, 

that is, regions in the precursor where the temperature can reach extremely high values 

(Hesas et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2010).  

Contrarily, MW radiation allows a rapid, uniform and selective heating. MWs are 

converted into heat at the molecular level of the precursor. When a carbonaceous material 

is subjected to MW radiation, with a certain frequency, its molecules (with an induced or 

permanent dipole) react through a dipole rotation. In order to be oriented towards the 

opposite direction of the applied field, the movement of the molecules causes a molecular 

agitation, which generates heat (Ania et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010; Yang 

et al., 2010). Heating occurs by energy transference instead of heat transference (Hesas et 

al., 2013). In this context, temperature gradient occurs from the internal particles of the 

precursor to its cold surroundings, allowing a volumetric, effective (energy saving) and 

faster heating (Hesas et al., 2013; Saucier et al., 2015; Wahi et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2010). 

Thus, this thermal gradient allows higher temperatures in the precursors interior, which 

provides the volatilisation of low molecular weight compounds and the further 

development of pores (Hesas et al., 2013). Other advantages that can be pointed out 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

17 

include: (1) easiness of heating control, (2) higher production yield with well-developed 

porosity and SBET, (3) does not involve heating by convection, (4) it is a safer and easier 

methodology to manipulate, (5) the equipment is smaller, (6) requires lower energy 

demands and (7) produces less waste (Hesas et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2002; Li et al., 2009; 

Wahi et al., 2017).  

Such as for the conventional pyrolysis, the starting material, heating temperature, 

gaseous atmosphere (gas type and flow rate), reaction time, physical/chemical activation 

agent, impregnation ratio (IR) and time, oxidative atmosphere, are some conditions that 

need to be considered when applying MW radiation (Hesas et al., 2013; Wahi et al., 2017). 

The main difference between conventional and MW heating is that, the sample heating 

occurs by manipulation of the MW power, which is indirectly related to the temperature. 

Radiation time is a determinant parameter given that longer heating periods can cause 

porous structure shrinkage, carbon burning and/or pores rupture, resulting in lower SBET. 

In opposition, shorter radiation times and higher MW power favours porosity and SBET 

development (Hesas et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2010; Wahi et al., 2017).  

Contrarily to conventional pyrolysis, MW pyrolysis requires a prior activation since 

carbonaceous precursors are transparent to MW radiation (Hesas et al., 2013; Liu et al., 

2010; Namazi et al., 2015; Saucier et al., 2015). The production of AC by MW pyrolysis can 

be achieved in two different ways:  

i. It can be produced by one-step chemical activation, in which the precursor is 

impregnated with a chemical agent that acts as absorber of MW radiation. A 

paste, referred to as slurry, is formed which can be directly carbonised by MW 

pyrolysis or can be previously dried (Hesas et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2010; Zaini &amp;amp; 

Kamaruddin, 2013); 

ii. It can be a two-steps production, in which the precursor is activated by 

conventional pyrolysis, forming a rudimental carbon skeleton that acts as MW 

radiation absorber allowing the precursor to carbonise. Then, the carbonised 

material can be physically/chemically activated and subjected to MW pyrolysis 

(Saucier et al., 2015; Zaini &amp;amp; Kamaruddin, 2013). 



Chapter 1: Introduction 

18 

As shown in Table 1, the production of ACs in one-step requires lower heating times 

and therefore, are less energy demanding than ACs produced by two-steps MW pyrolysis 

(Table 2). Results found in literature have shown that SBET values for ACs produced by 

conventional pyrolysis range between 600 and 1300 m2/g  (Baccar et al., 2012; González et 

al. , 2009; Mestre et al., 2011, 2014; Rajapaksha et al., 2014; Tay et al., 2009), while ACs 

produced by MW pyrolysis exhibit higher SBET with values ranging between 700 and 2000 

m2/g (Ahmed &amp;amp; Theydan, 2012; Deng et al., 2009; Foo &amp;amp; Hameed, 2012d, 2012b; Huang et 

al., 2011; Li et al., 2008, 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Saucier et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2010). 

Despite of the good properties attained for ACs produced by MW pyrolysis of 

alternative precursors, few studies address the use of paper mill sludge as precursor for 

the production of ACs by MW radiation. Jiang and Ma (2011) applied MW radiation to paper 

mill sludge for waste disposal purposes, that is, to reduce the mass of sludge. Namazi et al. 

(2015) produced ACs by combining PS and BS (1:1 ratio); Nevertheless, the authors did not 

test the adsorption capacity of the produced materials. As far as it is known, there are no 

studies of paper mill sludge-based ACs, obtained through MW pyrolysis, to remove 

pharmaceuticals from water. Taking into account the large availability of this carbonaceous 

waste and the limitations related to the use of expensive ACs for water treatment, the 

production of ACs by MW pyrolysis of PS seems to be an optimist solution.

1.4. ANALYTICAL QUANTIFICATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS: BASIC DESCRIPTION 
OF CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS 

In the scope of this work, the quantification of CBZ in aqueous phase was carried 

out through capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis is a separation technique 

that lays down in the separation of charged molecules through their movement in a fluid 

when subjected to a constant external electric field. A thin capillary, with a thickness in the 

?m range, is used as a physical support for the molecules to get separated (Calisto, 2011; 

Oliveira, 2017). The electrophoretic separation requires an electric current input, vials 

containing samples and electrolytes, two metallic electrodes at the inlet and outlet, a silica 

capillary (and therefore composed by silanol functional groups suitable for 

functionalisation purposes), a detection system and a software to operate the instrument 

and manage data acquisition and processing (Calisto, 2011), as illustrated in Figure 6.   

 

 

Figure 6. Schematic representation of capillary electrophoresis system 

 

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is a separative technique that 

could also be considered for pharmaceutical quantification purposes. Nevertheless, when 

compared to HPLC, capillary electrophoresis exhibits advantages such as (Calisto, 2011; 

Oliveira, 2017): 

- The use of smaller amounts of reagents; 

- Capillaries are less expensive than HPLC columns; 



Chapter 1: Introduction 

22 

- Capillaries are more versatile, in the sense that the stationary phase can be 

modified through capillary coatings or by adding a pseudostationary phase; 

- Allows the separation of molecules in a wide range of molecular weights and 

charges; 

- Presents a higher separation resolution than HPLC. 

The electrophoretic separation is a consequence of two driving forces, 

electrophoretic mobility and electroosmotic flow (EOF). Electrophoretic mobility is related 

to the movement of charged molecules due to an electrostatic force originated by the 

applied electric field. Moreover, as a result of the applied electric field, a liquid flow known 

as EOF is formed when the electrolyte contacts the charged inner walls of the capillary.  

Capillary electrophoresis can occur in several separation modes, being the simplest 

one known as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). In CZE, sample is injected into a capillary 

filled with electrolytic solution, also mentioned as buffer, to allow the analyte molecules to 

be separated. A constant electric field is applied when the two extremities of the capillary 

are immersed in the buffer, generating an electric potential difference, which causes the 

migration of the charged molecules along the capillary towards the detector. Since this 

separation mode was limited to charged molecules, it was necessary to adopt measures to 

assure the mobility of neutral molecules. Electrokinetic capillary chromatography was 

developed in order to overcome this constraint, by introducing a pseudostationary phase 

in the separation buffer, combining concepts of both CZE and chromatography. Surfactants 

are commonly added to the separation buffer, in which the surfactant molecules involve 

the neutral molecules in the aqueous solution by forming micelles, referred to as 

pseudostationary phase. This separation mode is named micellar electrokinetic 

chromatography (MEKC). The neutral analytes, involved in the micelles, also migrate 

through electrophoretic mobility and EOF. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) is commonly 

used as surfactant, which allows the formation of negatively charged micelles that migrate 

towards the outlet vial (Calisto, 2011; Oliveira, 2017).

1.5. MAIN GOALS OF THE PRESENT WORK 

This work aims to produce ACs by MW pyrolysis of paper mill PS to remove CBZ 

from water. Specific goals of this work include: 

 

- To evaluate the effect of IR between precursor and activating agent in the 

resulting AC; 

- To evaluate the repeatability of the AC production process; 

- To characterise the produced ACs by determining the total organic carbon (TOC) 

content, the SBET and total pore volume (VP); 

- To assess the adsorptive performance of the produced ACs to remove CBZ, 

through batch adsorption tests in ultra-pure water for different dosages of AC;  

- To evaluate how the mass of AC and the contact time between 

adsorbent/adsorbate affect the adsorption of CBZ onto the AC, through 

adsorption experiments in batch mode.

Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

27 

2.1. REAGENTS 

PS was chemically activated with KOH (Akzo Nobel) in pellets form. The produced 

ACs were washed with a solution of hydrochloric acid (? 37 %, Fluka).  

The adsorption tests were performed with CBZ (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), which was 

quantified by capillary electrophoresis using the following chemicals: sodium dodecyl 

sulphate PA-ACS (Panreac), sodium tetraborate (borax, Riedel-de Haen), hexadimethrine 

bromide (polybrene, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide (VWR), 

ethylvanillin (99%, Aldrich), acetonitrile (Chem-Lab, HPLC grade). 

For IC determination a diluted solution of phosphoric acid (85 % for analyses -ACS-

ISO, Panreac) was used. 

Except the washing acid solution, that was prepared with distilled water, all the 

solutions were prepared with ultra-pure water obtained from a Milli-Q Millipore system 

(Milli-Q plus 185). 

 

2.2. PRODUCTION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS 

ACs were produced by one-step chemical 

activation and MW pyrolysis of paper mill PS. The 

precursor was provided by a Portuguese paper 

mill industry that applies a chemical process 

(chlorine free) known as kraft process, to 

eucalyptus wood (Eucalyptus globulus). According 

to the procedure described by Calisto et al. 

(2014), PS was collected and subjected to two 

drying steps: dried at room temperature for 

several days and then dried at 60 °C in an oven for 

24 h. Subsequently, PS was grinded with a blade 

mill (Figure 7).

28 

PS was then chemically activated with KOH and three activating agent:precursor 

ratios were tested: 0.5:1, 1:1 and 1.5:1 (w/w). For each carbon produced, a mixture was 

prepared in a proportion of 9 mL of ultra-pure water per 3 g of precursor and the 

corresponding mass of KOH for each IR. Both precursor and activating agent were weighted 

on an analytical balance with an uncertainty of ± 0.0001 g. After homogenisation, the 

sample was impregnated for 1 h in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature. 

The slurry (precursor impregnated with activating agent) was placed into a 

cylindrical quartz reactor (2.2 cm diameter x 38.5 cm length), which was held in the reactor 

with a folded cone-shaped glass fibre filter (Whatman, 47 mm). The reactor was inserted 

vertically, as shown in Figure 8, into a modified Samsung MW furnace (2.45 GHz) with an 

adjustable power between 100 and 800 W.  

 

 

Figure 8. Experimental apparatus used in this work: (a) Quartz reactor; (b) Experimental setup used for MW 
pyrolysis; (c) Slurry placed inside the quartz reactor in the MW furnace 

 

The bottom of the reactor was tapered and connected to a N2 flow. The top of the 

reactor was surrounded by a removable metallic cover (7.5 cm length), which was attached 

to a silica exhaust pipe (0.8 cm diameter x 38 cm length) from which the pyrolysis gases 

were expelled (Figure 8). The MW pyrolysis was performed under an inert atmosphere after 

a 15 min purge with a N2 flow, ensuring the removal of oxygen from the reaction system.

pharmaceuticals from water 

29 

The slurry was pyrolysed for 10 min at a radiation power of 800 W. The N2 flow was kept 

until the carbonised sample was cooled to room temperature, for about 10 min. 

The carbonised material was removed from the reactor, milled and soaked with a 

1.2 M HCl solution at a 50 mL/g liquid to solid ratio. This procedure, not only allowed the 

removal of residual KOH activating agent, but also promoted the unblocking of the 

obstructed pores by inorganic material (ashes). The material remained suspended in the 

acid solution for 1 h, similarly to the procedure described in Oliveira (2017), after which it 

was vacuum filtered and repeatedly washed with distilled water until neutral pH of the 

washing solution was achieved. The AC was then dried at 105 °C for 48 h, weighed, sieved 

to obtain the fraction of particles with a size up to 180 ?m and stored in polypropylene 

vessels for further experiments. The production of ACs is summarised in Figure 9. 

 

 

Figure 9. Stages of the ACs production performed in the present work 

 



Chapter 2: Materials and methods 

30 

The production yield was determined as the ratio between the mass of the 

produced AC and the initial mass of precursor, both weighted in dry basis, 

 

Yield (%) =  
mi

m0
 × 100     (1) 

 

where m0 is the mass of PS and mi is the mass of the produced carbon after activation, 

grinding, washing and drying. 

All the materials were produced in triplicate to evaluate the repeatability of the 

process, resulting in a total of nine ACs. The produced materials were named according to 

the production conditions, namely, precursor (PS), activating agent (KOH), activating 

agent:precursor ratio and the production batch (first, second or third production). For 

example, PS-KOH-0.5:1-1batch is related to the AC obtained from PS, chemically activated 

with KOH in a 0.5:1 (activating agent:precursor) ratio during the first production (1 batch). 

The same analogy was considered to name the remaining produced ACs. 

Preliminary tests were performed, consisting of the MW pyrolysis of the PS without 

activating agent or with lower quantity of activating agent (in a proportion of 0.1:1) and no 

carbonisation was achieved.  

 

2.3. CHARACTERISATION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS 

2.3.1. TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON 

Total organic carbon (TOC) was determined for the precursor and for the produced 

ACs by difference between total carbon (TC) and inorganic carbon (IC), which were analysed 

in a TOC-VCPH Shimadzu analyser, with a solid sample module SSM-5000A. For both TC and 

IC determination, a blank test was carried out at the beginning of each work session, using 

an empty porcelain crucible. Glucose (C6H12O6, corresponding to 40 % of carbon), was used 

to test the calibration curve previously made for TC determination, while sodium carbonate 

(Na2CO3, corresponding to 11% of carbon) was the control standard used for IC 

determination. The carbon content of the precursor and ACs was determined as the 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

31 

average of three replicates whenever the amount of AC allowed it. For IC determination, 4 

mL of phosphoric acid:water (1:2) was added into the porcelain crucibles (blank and 

samples). The samples were weighed in a microbalance with an uncertainty of ± 0.001 mg. 

 

2.3.2. SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA (SBET) AND POROSITY 

The determination of SBET and porosity were accomplished through a collaboration 

with Instituto Nacional del Carbón (INCAR – CSIC), Oviedo, Spain. SBET was obtained from a 

Micromeritics equipment (Gemini VII 2380) using nitrogen adsorption isotherms at -196 °C 

and applying the BET model in the relative pressure range of 0.01 to 0.1. Samples were 

submitted to a degasification process at 120 °C overnight. VP was determined from the 

amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99. Dubinin-Astakhov equation was 

applied to the lower relative pressure zone of the nitrogen adsorption isotherm to obtain 

total micropore volume (W0). SBET and VP were determined for all the materials except for 

the precursor.  

 

2.4. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS 

2.4.1. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS WITH THE PRODUCED ACTIVATED CARBONS 

Adsorption tests in batch mode were carried out to assess the adsorption of CBZ 

onto the nine produced ACs. For that purpose, solutions of CBZ were prepared in ultra-pure 

water, with an initial concentration of 5 mg/L. CBZ and ACs were weighed in a microbalance 

with an uncertainty of ± 0.001 mg. 

Studies were carried out for each AC at different dosages, namely 0.025, 0.05 and 

0.1 g/L. The weighed carbon (1 mg) was transferred to polypropylene tubes with a total 

capacity of 50 mL, and the corresponding volume of 5 mg/L pharmaceutical solution was 

added in order to achieve the intended AC dosage, as summarised in Table 3. All the tests 

were performed, at least, in triplicate.

A control experiment consisting of pharmaceutical solution without the adsorbent, 

was carried out simultaneously with each adsorption test in order to assess the (possible) 

pharmaceutical adsorption onto the polypropylene tubes and/or its thermal degradation. 

The samples and control were shaken in an overhead shaker (Heidolph, Reax 2) at 80 rpm 

under a controlled temperature of 25.0 ± 0.1 °C for 24 h. Then, control and samples were 

filtered through a 0.22 ?m PVDF syringe filter (13 mm diameter, Whatman), as shown in 

Figure 10, to stop the adsorption process by removing the adsorbent.

syringe filter system 

 

Control and samples were analysed by capillary electrophoresis, as described in 

Section 2.5., in order to determine the concentration of pharmaceutical that remained in 

the aqueous phase. The percentage of CBZ adsorbed was determined by the difference 

between the initial concentration of pharmaceutical, given by the control test, and the 

concentration of CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase of each sample after filtration,

where C0 is the initial concentration of CBZ provided by the control test and Cf is the 

concentration of CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase. The adsorption percentage of 

each AC was determined as the average of all replicates. 

Due to the small masses of AC used to achieve the desired AC dosage in the 

described experiments, some tests were performed to assess the possibility of AC adhesion 

onto the walls and lids of the propylene tubes, which might have a significant impact in the 

AC that is effectively in contact with the pharmaceutical solution. For this purpose, and 

maintaining the same final AC dosage, higher masses of AC were used and some of the 

described batch adsorption tests were repeated. Due to the limited quantities of AC 

produced, tests using 2 mg of adsorbent were applied to only four ACs, namely, PS-KOH-

0.5:1-2batch, PS-KOH-1:1-2batch, PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch, to achieve 

the final AC dosage of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L. Experiments using 3 mg of AC could only be 

performed for PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch, for an AC dosage of 0.1 g/L, 

as shown in Table 4. Tests were not performed for an AC dosage of 0.025 g/L, since the 

maximum volume of 50 mL of the polypropylene tubes would inevitably require 1 mg of AC 

per 40 mL of pharmaceutical solution, considering that the concentration of the 

pharmaceutical solution was not changed.

out for 24 h in triplicate, under controlled temperature and shaking. After capillary 

electrophoresis analyses, the adsorption percentages were determined according to 

Equation 2. 

 

2.4.2. EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF CONTACT TIME 

In order to confirm if the adsorbent/adsorbate contact time was enough for 

attaining the maximum removal percentages at the studied conditions, 49 and 72 h 

adsorption tests were also performed for the ACs PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-KOH-0.5:1-

3batch. The experiments were performed using 1 and 2 mg of AC to achieve the final AC 

dosage of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L. The experimental conditions were the same as described in 

Section 2.4.1. 

 

2.5. QUANTIFICATION OF CARBAMAZEPINE BY CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS 

The quantification of the CBZ was performed in a Beckman P/ACE MDQ 

electrophoresis equipment, equipped with a UV-Vis photodiode array detector, operated 

with the software 32 Karat. The pharmaceutical was quantified according to a MEKC 

method by using a dynamically coated capillary and an electrolyte buffer consisting of 30 

mM of SDS and 15 mM of sodium tetraborate (borax).  

Before the first usage, a silica capillary of 40 cm length (75 ?m inner diameter and 

375 ?m external diameter), 30 cm to the detection window, was coated, as described in 

Table 5. A 1 M NaOH solution was used for the activation of the silanol groups and 

hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene) was responsible for adding positively charged 

functional groups. In order to avoid the capillary blocking, all the reagents (buffer, 

polybrene and NaOH), samples including, were previously filtered through 0.22 ?m PVDF 

filters (Whatman). 

Separation was carried out at 25 °C by applying an electric field of 25 kV, for 

approximately 3.6 min. The detection of CBZ occurred at 214 nm, according to the 

pharmaceutical absorption spectra. Ethylvanillin was used as internal standard (IS) and 

added to all the samples at an initial concentration of 167 mg/L. Samples were injected by 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water

pressure, implying non-repeatable injection volumes; For that reason, the IS was used for 

pharmaceuticals quantification purposes through the ratio between the CBZ peak area and 

the IS peak area (ACBZ/AIS). The experimental conditions used for capillary electrophoresis 

analysis are listed in Table 5. Each sample, that is, control and each replicate from the 

adsorption experiments, was analysed in triplicated.

To integrate the obtained electropherograms, Matlab 9.0 (R2016a) compiler was 

used. Figure 11 represents an example of an electropherogram, in which the first peak 

represents EOF, the peak with a migration time around 1.7 min corresponds to the IS, and 

around 2.7 min there is the peak corresponding to CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase.

2.5.1. CALIBRATION CURVE 

To estimate the concentration of CBZ a calibration curve was performed for each 

capillary renewal. 

Seven standards with concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mg/L were 

prepared by dilution of a 5 mg/L stock solution in 5 mL volumetric flasks. The standards 

were quantified by MEKC according to the experimental conditions described in Table 5 

(Section 2.5.). The standards were analysed in quadruplicate. A linear calibration curve was 

obtained by applying the least-squares linear regression, in which the ACBZ/AIS ratio was 

represented as a function of the pharmaceutical concentration, according to the equation: 

 

y = mx + b      (3) 

 

where y is ACBZ/AIS, x is the concentration of CBZ, m is the slope and b is the intercept on 

the y-axis.  

The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were determined by the 

calibration curve method, according to International Conference on Harmonization (2005) 

guidelines. LOD and LOQ were obtained through the equations:

Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

41 

3.1. PRODUCTION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS 

As mentioned previously, three production batches were carried out, in the exact 

same experimental conditions for three different IRs, from which nine ACs resulted. During 

the slurry carbonisation it was observed the formation of flame and incandescence, whose 

intensity and duration varied with the IR, being more pronounced for lower concentrations 

of activating agent. For the slurry with an IR of 0.5:1 (activating agent:precursor), flame 

formation/incandescence occurred intense and continuously in the initial heating minutes 

(3 – 4 min), becoming intermittent over the process, until at the end it was not observed. 

Considering the slurry with the IR of 1:1, when flame formation/incandescence occurred, 

it was observed for smaller periods of time, when compared to 0.5:1 ratio. Finally, for the 

1.5:1 slurry carbonisation no flame was observed, and when incandescence occurred, it 

was intermittent and for short periods of time. These experimental occurrences may be 

related to the carbonisation rate, in the sense that for the materials in which the flame 

formation/incandescence was more intense (0.5:1 ratio), the final ACs presented a more 

blackish appearance, which may be related to a more complete carbonisation (Figure 12). 

The achievement of a “complete” carbonisation with lower concentrations of KOH can be 

an advantageous feature in the economic point of view.  

 

 

Figure 12. ACs produced in the activating agent:precursor ratio of 0.5:1 

 

 



Chapter 3: Results and discussion 

42 

For the materials in which the flame formation/incandescence was less intense, 1:1 

and 1.5:1 ratios, the final ACs still presented some brownish fractions, probably due to the 

incomplete carbonisation of the precursor as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14, 

respectively. 

 

 

Figure 13. ACs produced in the activating agent:precursor ratio of 1:1 

 

 

Figure 14. ACs produced in the activating agent:precursor ratio of 1.5:1 

 

As shown in Figure 15, the production yield (calculated by Equation 1) did not varied 

significantly for ACs within the same IR, nevertheless, there was a slight difference for ACs 

produced with different IRs, being PS-KOH-0.5:1, the AC obtained with higher product yield.

43 

 

Figure 15. Production yield (%) of the produced ACs 

 

Table 1 (Section 1.3.) summarises the production conditions, yield and textural 

properties of ACs available in literature, produced by one-step MW pyrolysis of alternative 

precursors, similarly to those used in the present work. For comparative purposes, PS-KOH-

0.5:1 was considered with an average yield of 11 ± 1 %, which is slightly lower than the 

production yields reported in literature. 

Overall, losses during the production are significant, in the way that 3 g of PS 

originated approximately 300 mg of AC. Besides the inevitable losses that occurred 

throughout the production stages, it was found that the step that had major influence in 

the obtained yield was the acid washing. As mentioned in previous studies (Calisto et al., 

2017; Jaria et al., 2015, 2017; Pereira, 2017), these losses can be related to the removal of 

the inorganic material, such as ashes, improving microporosity and SBET due to the 

unblocking of obstructed pores.  

It should be noted that the chemical activation of carbonaceous materials produces 

adsorbents with a well-developed porosity, which may result in lighter materials and 

therefore, lower production yields. Nevertheless, the production yield of the produced ACs 

decreases by increasing the concentration of the activating agent, which was not attributed 

to a well-developed porous structure since Vp also decreases with the increase of KOH 



Chapter 3: Results and discussion 

44 

concentration, as shown in Table 6 (Section 3.2.2.). These losses may be related to a higher 

decomposition of the precursor due to the reaction with KOH.  

Preliminary experiments of the MW pyrolysis of PS in the absence of the activating 

agent or lower quantity of activating agent (activating agent:precursor of 0.1:1), 

demonstrated that no carbonisation was achieved. These results are an evidence that the 

activating agent not only promotes structural changes through the formation of new pores 

and/or widening the existing ones, but also promotes the production of char by acting as 

MW radiation absorber.  

The production process of the ACs by MW pyrolysis presented some inherent 

variables difficult to control, such as: 

- The equipment used for MW pyrolysis was a domestic MW, in which the heating 

process was assisted by a rotatory plate. The modifications to the MW, 

described in Section 2.2., did not allowed the sample to be heated in a rotatory 

movement, which means that uniformity of radiation inside the equipment 

could not be guaranteed; 

- The quartz reactor was built analogously to other reactors described in 

literature allowing small dosages of slurry. Also, due to its shape, it was difficult 

to assure a homogeneous sample packaging for each production; 

- Contrarily to conventionally heated experiments in muffle furnaces, the 

reaction temperature could not be measured; 

- To assure oxygen-free conditions, the system was purged with N2 before 

pyrolysis. When regulating the N2 flow the slurry was slightly vertically 

dislocated. According to the experiments carried out, it is not possible to assure 

if this displacement could (or not) move the slurry, to a position out of the 

optimal radiative field. Similarly, the carbonised material could be displaced by 

the N2 flow during heating.

3.2. CHARACTERISATION OF ACTIVATED CARBONS 

3.2.1. TOTAL ORGANIC CARBON 

The ACs were produced from a starting material composed by 30.5 ± 0.3 % of TC, 

4.4 ± 0.2 % of IC and therefore 26.0 ± 0.4 % of TOC. Figure 16 shows that MW pyrolysis 

promoted an increase of the OC content in the obtained ACs. The results reinforce that MW 

pyrolysis, along with the acid washing, is responsible for the removal of most IC content, 

reducing it to negligible values (under 0.2 %).  

 

 

Figure 16. Carbon content of the PS, produced ACs and the commercial AC (PBFG4) used as reference. 
*Data published in Jaria et al. (2018) 

 

The carbon content of the ACs produced by MW pyrolysis were compared to ACs 

produced by conventional pyrolysis of PS. According to the production conditions described 

in Jaria et al. (2018), the ACs were named as CPy-PS800-150KOH-1:1, CPy-PS800-60KOH-

1:1, CPy-PS650-150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS650-60KOH-1:1, corresponding to the conventional 

pyrolysis of PS impregnated with KOH (1:1 ratio), at temperatures of 650 or 800 °C for 60

or 150 min. Also for comparison purposes, it was considered a commercial powder AC 

named PULSORB FG4 (PBFG4), provided by ChemViron Carbon.  

Overall, the MW pyrolysed ACs have TOC values ranging between 42.5 ± 0.5 % and 

49.6 ± 0.4 %, representing low values when compared to the commercial AC PBFG4 with 

77.5 ± 0.1 % of TOC (data published in Jaria et al., 2018). The ACs produced by conventional 

pyrolysis present higher TOC than the ACs produced by MW radiation, with CPy-PS650-

150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS650-60KOH-1:1 presenting around 54.9 ± 0.1 % and CPy-PS800-

150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS800-60KOH-1:1 around 67 ± 1 % (Jaria et al., 2018). Considering the 

ACs obtained by conventional pyrolysis, the increase in temperature resulted in an increase 

of TOC, raising the question of whether or not the increase of MW radiation time could 

increment the carbon content. Contrarily to conventional pyrolysis, the temperature to 

which the sample was subjected during the MW heating could not be measured. As 

mentioned in Section 1.3., the MW power is indirectly related to the temperature, which 

in this particular case could not be increased since the maximum power of the equipment 

is 800 W. Therefore, the only variable that could be manipulated during the carbonisation 

process would be radiation time. 

 

3.2.2. SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA (SBET) AND POROSITY 

Table 6 summarises the results obtained for SBET and porous structure of the 

produced ACs. Both Table 6 and Figure 17 support the high variability within ACs with the 

same IR from different batches that were obtained under the same experimental 

conditions. The variability of SBET (and VP) is more pronounced for ACs obtained with higher 

concentration of activating agent (1.5:1 ratio), showing a relative standard deviation (RSD) 

of 48 %. Within the ACs produced with a 0.5:1 ratio, the variability of SBET in relation to the 

mean was less pronounced, showing a RSD of 23 %. One observes some consistency of the 

obtained results for both PS-KOH-0.5:1 and PS-KOH-1:1 from the second and third batches. 

The AC with the lower IR (PS-KOH-0.5:1) presents better textural properties, with 

an average SBET of 946 ± 217 m2/g and an average VP of 0.72 ± 0.13 cm3/g. PS-KOH-0.5:1-

1batch stands out from the other two batches under the same experimental conditions 

with a SBET of 1190 m2/g, which may be due to some experimental constraints, in which the 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

47 

precursor remained impregnated in the activating agent for 4 h instead 1 h. Overall, SBET 

and Vp decrease with the increase of the activating agent concentration, which is in line 

with data published by Saucier et al. (2015) and Thue et al. (2016).

The nine produced ACs have an average pore diameter smaller than 2 nm, which 

according to IUPAC (2014) classification, are attributed to micropores. Overall, the 

adsorbents exhibit a well-developed microporous structure, allowing the enhancement of 

the SBET, which is complemented by some mesoporosity that can act as channels allowing 

the access to the micropores.  

Both PS-KOH-0.5:1 and PS-KOH-1:1, except PS-KOH-1:1-1batch, present SBET values 

comparable to the commercial AC PBFG4. Considering the ACs obtained by conventional 

pyrolysis, the adsorbents produced at 800 °C have better textural properties than the same 

ACs produced at 650 °C, with CPy-PS650-150KOH-1:1 and CPy-PS650-60KOH-1:1 presenting 

a SBET of 473 m2/g and 523 m2/g, respectively (Jaria et al., 2018). Moreover, the ACs 

produced at 800 °C by conventional pyrolysis present a more developed porosity and 

higher SBET when compared to MW pyrolysed ACs. It is noteworthy that the textural 

properties of PS-KOH-0.5:1 here produced were achieved in less time and with less 

activating agent than the ACs produced by conventional pyrolysis. However, poor levels of 

reaction control such as lack of temperature monitorisation and non-homogeneous 

radiation inside the equipment, as mentioned in Section 3.1., limit the comparison with 

conventionally produced ACs. 

The results summarised in Table 1, Section 1.3., related to ACs chemically activated 

by one-step MW pyrolysis, were considered for comparison purposes. Overall, PS-KOH-

0.5:1 presents satisfying SBET when compared to ACs produced from giant reed (Chayid &amp;amp; 

Ahmed, 2015), cocoa shell (Saucier et al., 2015), cotton stalk (Deng et al., 2009) and paper 

mill sludge (containing PS and BS in a ratio of 1:1) (Namazi et al., 2015). However, when 

compared to ACs obtained from siris seed pods (Ahmed &amp;amp; Theydan, 2013, 2014b), lotus 

stalks (Huang et al., 2011) and bamboo (Liu et al., 2010), PS-KOH-0.5:1 exhibit lower SBET. 

These results reinforce the cruciality of developing further work towards the optimisation 

of ACs production by MW pyrolysis of PS, evaluating, besides the effect of IR, the effect of 

MW power, radiation time and the resulting effects on the adsorption percentages of 

adsorbate.

3.3. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS 

3.3.1. QUANTIFICATION OF CARBAMAZEPINE BY CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS 

The adsorption tests were carried out for the nine produced ACs with three 

different carbon dosages (as listed in Table 3, Section 2.4.1.) suspended in a stock solution 

of CBZ with a concentration of 5 mg/L.  When the adsorption tests were concluded the 

amount of CBZ that remained in the aqueous phase was quantified by MEKC. The 

correlation coefficient of the calibration curves was above 0.995. LOD and LOQ values were 

0.042 and 0.129 mg/L, respectively. 

Figure 18 shows two electropherograms, where electropherogram (a) represents 

the control test corresponding to ? 5 mg/L of CBZ, and electropherogram (b) relates an 

experiment in which the amount of pharmaceutical that remained in the aqueous fraction 

was relatively low.

3.3.2. PRELIMINARY ADSORPTION EXPERIMENTS 

Preliminary adsorption tests, following the description from Section 2.4.1, were 

performed for non-washed ACs, for a carbon dosage of 0.1 g/L (24 h shaking at 80 rpm and 

25 °C). The results showed that without washing with HCl 1.2 M, the ACs were not able to 

remove CBZ from ultra-pure water solutions, exhibiting adsorption percentages lower than 



Chapter 3: Results and discussion 

50 

10 %. These experiments reinforce previous observations regarding the importance of the 

washing procedure to unblock obstructed pores. 

Saucier et al. (2015) concluded similarly in the studies performed for the removal 

of nimesulide. The authors observed, for adsorbent dosages of 2.5 g/L, that the AC achieved 

a removal percentage of 98.75 % when washed with an acid solution, while the 

corresponding non-washed AC removed 40.25 % of pharmaceutical (contact time of 120 

min, at 25 °C for a 100 mg/L nimesulide solution). 

In this sense, the adsorption experiments in the present work were carried out with 

the produced ACs previously washed with a HCl solution. 

 

3.3.3. BATCH ADSORPTION TESTS WITH THE PRODUCED ACTIVATED CARBONS 

The removal percentages of CBZ have a pronounced variability within ACs with the 

same IR from different batches, obtained under the same experimental conditions, 

similarly to what was observed for SBET, as illustrated in Figure 19. It can be noted that the 

increase of the carbon dosage from 0.025 to 0.1 g/L results in higher removal percentages 

of CBZ, in which 0.1 g/L is, generally, the dosage that exhibits larger removal percentages. 

The variability is also reflected in the concentration of KOH, in which the adsorption 

percentages of CBZ decreased for ACs with higher concentration of activating agent, with 

PS-KOH-1.5:1 presenting less consistency and lower adsorption percentages. According to 

Ahmed and Theydan (2013), the increase in the concentration of activating agent can lead 

to the micropores degradation due to an excessive widening of the pores, which is reflected 

in a lower adsorption efficiency. 

PS-KOH-0.5:1-1batch has the best CBZ removal rate, with values of 90 ± 3 % and 

97.1 ± 0.5 %, for adsorbent dosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L, respectively. These results are 

consistent with the high SBET and well-developed porosity of this AC. According to the 

textural properties of PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch it would be expected 

better removal performances for the latter, due to its higher SBET (875 m2/g), which is not 

confirmed by the adsorption percentages, that are lower for PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch.

PS-KOH-1:1-1batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch have analogous adsorption percentages 

for the same AC dosages, which was not expected considering that the first batch has 

smaller SBET and Vp than the third batch. Taking into account the similarities between SBET 



Chapter 3: Results and discussion 

52 

and Vp of PS-KOH-1:1-2batch (820 m2/g, 0.68 cm3/g) and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch (816 m2/g, 

0.63 cm3/g), it would be expected that both removed CBZ from the aqueous phase similarly, 

which is not confirmed by the adsorption percentages in which the third batch presents 

remarkably lower percentages than the second batch, being more pronounced for the AC 

dosage of 0.05 g/L.  

When compared to the produced ACs by MW pyrolysis, ACs conventionally heated 

stands out with good CBZ removal uptakes (Table 7), presenting adsorption percentages 

around 80 % for lower AC dosages (0.015 g/L), as described in Jaria et al. (2018). The 

authors performed adsorption tests in similar conditions to those applied in the present 

work, however, instead of 24 h, the samples remained under overnight shaking. The ACs 

produced at 800 °C have higher adsorption percentages, as it would be expected due to 

their high SBET and well-developed porous network, as summarised in Table 6 (Section 

3.2.2.). CPy-PS800-60KOH-1:1 is the more promising AC, since it has the same adsorption 

percentage for lower energy consumption, hence lower costs. In addition, the use of lower 

AC dosages to achieve analogous outcomes for the removal of CBZ from water raises the 

adsorbent interest for being cost-efficient.

PBFG4 18 ± 5 

 

The commercial AC (PBFG4) used as reference presents lower adsorption 

percentages when compared to the ACs produced conventionally and those produced in 

the scope of this work. However, one should consider that PBFG4 uptakes were achieved 

for AC dosages of 0.015 g/L, which is almost two times inferior than the smaller AC dosage 

used in this work (0.025 g/L). Even though, considering the well-developed microporous 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

53 

structure of the produced ACs, it would be expected better CBZ removal percentages for 

PS-KOH-0.5:1 when compared to PBFG4, considering that the tests would be performed 

under the same experimental conditions. 

As mentioned in Section 2.4.1., the use of small masses of AC to perform the 

adsorption tests could be an influencing factor in the CBZ uptake percentages, in the sense 

that the effect of any small variation, such as adhesion of the adsorbent onto the tubes 

walls/lid, will be more evident when using low masses of AC than would be for higher 

masses. Therefore, and maintaining the same final AC dosage, batch adsorption tests were 

performed weighing 2 mg and 3 mg of AC as summarised in Table 4 (Section 2.4.1.). Since 

one of the raised doubts was related to the heterogeneity between batches obtained under 

the same experimental conditions, the tests were performed for PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch, PS-

KOH-0.5:1-3batch, PS-KOH-1:1-2batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch. The amount of AC was 

limited due to the low production yields, as shown in Figure 15 (Section 3.1.), which 

resulted in masses of AC that could vary between 140 and 300 mg, needed for physico-

chemical characterisation of the ACs and adsorption tests. The small amount of AC 

produced for each batch conditioned the number of experiments that could be performed, 

which also explains why the experiment with 3 mg was carried out for only two ACs from 

the third batch. 

The CBZ adsorption percentages are more consistent within ACs with the same IR 

from different batches when the AC dosage is achieved with masses of AC higher than 1 

mg, as shown in Figure 20. By weighing 2 mg of AC for a dosage of 0.05 g/L, PS-KOH-0.5:1-

2batch removes 68 ± 4 % of CBZ from ultra-pure water solution, and analogously, the 

corresponding AC from the third batch removes 65 ± 13 %. Similar observations can be 

made for a dosage of 0.1 g/L in which 2 mg of AC was weighed, with PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch 

and PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch presenting comparable adsorptions of 82 ± 5 % and 92 ± 6 %, 

respectively. For PS-KOH-1:1 the adsorption percentages vary more pronouncedly between 

PS-KOH-1:1-2batch and PS-KOH-1:1-3batch, even when 2 mg of AC were weighed, whose 

results are not consistent with the SBET values. As already mentioned, it would be expected 

to have similar CBZ removal percentages for the two batches of PS-KOH-1:1, with surface 

areas of 820 and 816 m2/g. 



Chapter 3: Results and discussion 

54 

 

Figure 20. Evaluation of the effect of the mass of AC weighed on the CBZ adsorption percentages for a 
contact time of 24 h 

 

It can be noted that for PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-KOH-1:1-2batch, for both AC 

dosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L, the increase of the AC mass from 1 to 2 mg results in lower 

CBZ removal percentages. The opposite trend is observed for the two ACs from the third 

batch, for both AC dosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L, in which the increase of the AC mass from 

1 to 2 mg results in higher percentages of CBZ removed. The experiments in which 3 mg of 

AC was weighed, demonstrate that the adsorption percentages do not vary significantly 

either by weighing 2 or 3 mg of AC, for a dosage of 0.1 g/L. With that being said, for a dosage 

of 0.1 g/L, PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch is able to remove CBZ from aqueous solution with a 

percentage of 92 ± 6 % and 91 ± 7 %, for a mass of AC of 2 and 3 mg, respectively. 



Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

55 

Analogously, PS-KOH-1:1-3batch has removal percentages of 94 ± 2 % and 90 ± 4 %, for an 

AC mass of 2 and 3 mg, respectively. With these results, one observes that the 

pharmaceutical uptake does not differs significantly for the same AC dosage obtained by 

weighing masses of 2 and 3 mg, which means that there should be homogeneity within ACs 

from the same batch. The amount of AC available did not allowed the experiments with 3 

mg of AC for PS-KOH-1:1-2batch, which would be helpful to demonstrate whether or not 

there was homogeneity between the two batches of PS-KOH-1:1 with similar textural 

properties. 

Theoretically the same removal percentage should be achieved regardless of the 

mass of AC weighed for a specific dosage of AC in suspension, which in practice is not 

observed. It seems that increasing the amount of AC, for instance, by performing the 

experiments for AC dosages of 0.1 g/L, weighing masses of 2 or 3 mg, might increase the 

reliability of the obtained results, improving the repeatability of the experiments within the 

batches. Taking into account ACs produced by MW pyrolysis, available literature has shown 

that, overall, batch adsorption experiments are performed for AC dosages above 0.1 g/L. 

Nevertheless, the adsorbate concentrations are also significantly higher than the initial 

concentration considered in this work (5 mg/L). Some examples include Saucier et al. 

(2015) that used an AC dosage of 2.5 g/L, that is, 50 mg of adsorbent per 20 mL of 100 mg/L 

pharmaceutical solution. Also Ahmed and Theydan (2014a) performed tests to assess the 

effect of the AC dosage on the adsorption percentage. For a 20 mg/L stock solution of 

ciprofloxacin, the authors observed an increase of the removal rate, from 79.94 % to 96.12 

% when the AC dosage was increased from 0.25 to 0.75 g/L (5 mg of AC per 20 mL of 

pharmaceutical solution and 15 mg of AC per 20 mL of pharmaceutical solution, 

respectively) (Ahmed &amp;amp; Theydan, 2014a). One observes that the adsorption experiments 

were performed with relatively high dosages of AC, implying the use of higher masses of 

AC when compared to the masses of adsorbent used in the present work, and therefore, if 

effects such as AC adhesion onto the walls of the vessels occurred, they would be 

imperceptible. 

Overall, the obtained results also show that different production batches resulted 

in ACs with different properties and performances, that ideally should present identical

Chapter 3: Results and discussion 

56 

features since they were produced under the same conditions. As far as it is known, the 

repeatability of the production process of ACs by MW pyrolysis is not discussed in 

literature. This subject should gain more focus given that, generally, the production process 

is limited to small amounts of slurry (or dried impregnated precursor), as mentioned in 

Section 3.1., which in addition to relatively low product yields may restrict physico-chemical 

characterisation and adsorption experiments, including removal percentages, kinetic and 

equilibrium studies. 

 

3.3.4. EVALUATION OF THE EFFECT OF CONTACT TIME 

Beside the possible effect of the mass of AC used, it was also hypothesised if the 

contact time between adsorbent/pharmaceutical (24 h) was enough to guarantee that the 

adsorbate could access the micropores of the produced ACs. In order to complement the 

already obtained results for 24 h, tests were carried out for PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and PS-

KOH-0.5:1-3batch for contact times of 49 and 72 h, by using 1 and 2 mg of AC for both AC 

dosages of 0.05 and 0.1 g/L. Results demonstrate that for both ACs, regardless of the 

adsorbent dosage, the percentage of CBZ adsorbed onto the AC decreased over time, as 

demonstrated in Figure 21 and Figure 22. 

It would be expected to observe a behaviour similar to the one described in Figure 

3 (Section 1.2.1.), in which the amount of CBZ adsorbed onto the AC would increase over 

time, until an equilibrium was attained. Even without reaching a plateau it was expected to 

observe an increase of the percentage of adsorption and not the other way around. 

Although the process of adsorption is an equilibrium between adsorbent and adsorbate in 

which there is, naturally, adsorption and desorption, the desorption of the pharmaceutical 

does not seem to explain the results obtained, at least not so pronouncedly.

Figure 22. Evaluation of the effect of contact time between CBZ and AC on the adsorption percentages, for 
AC dosages of 0.05 g/L and 0.1 g/L 

 

It seems that the increase of the contact time in addition to the possible effect of 

AC adhesion onto the walls/lids of the tubes (Figure 23), may be related to the decrease of 

the percentages of CBZ removed from aqueous solution. Probably, this effect may increase 

over time, resulting in the reduction of the amount of adsorbent available to retain CBZ. 



Chapter 3: Results and discussion 

58 

With the tubes in constant shaking, it seems unlikely that some particles of AC could also 

be aggregate to each other, nevertheless it is a possibility that also need to be considered.

Figure 24 illustrates the appearance of the suspensions after 72 h shaking at 

controlled temperature for a) PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch and b) PS-KOH-0.5:1-3batch. The 

difference in the appearance of the ACs suspensions reinforce that, regardless of the 

common production conditions, the two adsorbents present different characteristics.

59 

Overall, the adsorption percentages are lower for the experiments in which 1 mg of 

AC was used instead of 2 mg, for the same final dosage. The removal percentages are also 

lower for the adsorbent dosage of 0.05 g/L when compared to 0.1 g/L, evidencing that the 

reduced pharmaceutical uptake could be linked to the reduction of the amount of AC and 

therefore, reduction of adsorption active sites. Moreover, one highlights that PS-KOH-

0.5:1-3batch presents higher removal percentages than PS-KOH-0.5:1-2batch, which is in 

agreement with the better textural properties of the latter, with a SBET and Vp of 875 m2/g 

and 0.68 cm3/g, respectively. 

Studies found in literature, usually do not use contact times as long as 72 h, being 

commonly up to 24 h. Typically, several contact times are evaluated and the adsorption of 

pharmaceuticals onto the ACs tend to increase over time until the equilibrium is reached 

(Ahmed &amp;amp; Theydan, 2014a; Chayid &amp;amp; Ahmed, 2015; Huang et al., 2011). In order to 

understand the reason why the removal percentages of CBZ decreased over time, it would 

be relevant to test more contact times, which was not accomplished due to the insufficient 

amount of ACs.

Production of activated carbons by microwave pyrolysis of industrial wastes for the removal of 
pharmaceuticals from water 

63 

This work aimed to produce ACs using solid wastes from paper mill industry, namely 

PS, through non-conventional pyrolysis. Three MW pyrolysed ACs were produced in 

triplicate by changing the activating agent:precursor IR, from which nine ACs resulted. The 

produced adsorbents were physico-chemically characterised by determining TOC, SBET and 

Vp. In addition, the produced ACs were subjected to batch adsorption tests in order to 

assess their efficiency to remove CBZ from ultra-pure water solutions. The global 

appreciations were as follow: 

 

- The experimental results have shown that within the same IR, the produced ACs 

presented different properties and removal performances, evidencing that the 

production process needed to be enhanced in order to make it repeatable. The 

lack of repeatability could be related to the poor levels of reaction control such 

as difficulty to guarantee the uniformity of MW radiation inside the modified 

domestic MW. Moreover, it could be related to an incomplete carbonisation, 

requiring the process optimisation by defining the optimal MW power, radiation 

time, chemical agent and IR. Considering the exploratory nature of this work 

and the limited timeline, the IR was the only production parameter tested. 

 

- Overall, the ACs were characterised by a porous structure more developed than 

the commercial AC (PBFG4) used as reference. The ACs that presented better 

SBET (on average 946 m2/g), were those with lower concentrations of activating 

agent, PS-KOH-0.5:1, being a satisfactory feature in the economic point of view. 

 

- According to the removal percentages of CBZ from ultra-pure water solutions, 

it was shown that higher uptakes were achieved when the adsorption 

experiments were performed with PS-KOH-0.5:1, for an AC dosage of 0.1 g/L 

(weighing 2 or 3 mg of AC) and a contact time of 24 h. Under these experimental 

conditions, removal efficiencies above 80 % were observed. 

 



Chapter 4: Conclusions and future developments 

64 

The produced ACs had appreciable textural properties at an early and pioneering 

stage with regard to the type of precursor and heating methodology. Therefore, some 

future developments could include: 

 

- In a first stage, studies should be made in order to guarantee the repeatability 

of the production process.  

 

- Besides the effect of the IR, other operational parameters should be tested, 

including the effect that other activating agents such as K2CO3 and H3PO4, MW 

power and radiation time could have on the final AC and how it would be 

reflected in the pharmaceutical removal efficiencies.  

 

- Physico-chemical characterisation (beside TOC, SBET and Vp), kinetic adsorption 

studies and adsorption equilibrium studies should be performed. 

 

- Considering the difficulty to guarantee the homogeneous slurry packaging into 

the quartz reactor, experiments could be performed in parallel by using the 

dried impregnated precursor. 

 

- Other classes and mixtures of pharmaceuticals could be assessed and tests 

could also be carried out for spiked WWTP effluents.
