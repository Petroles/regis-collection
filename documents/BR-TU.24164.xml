Resumo 
 

O nosso planeta está a sofrer uma inquestionável mudança climática, cada vez mais acentuada, 

atribuída a ações antropogénicas. Devido ao constante crescimento populacional e diante dos novos 

desenvolvimentos tecnológicos tem-se observado uma intensificação de atividades humanas com 

consequências nocivas para a sustentabilidade do Sistema Terrestre. O aumento contínuo da emissão de 

gases que contribuem para o efeito de estufa tem como fonte principal a queima de combustíveis fósseis 

(CO2), a agricultura intensiva (CH4) e o emprego de gases fluorados industriais. O fenómeno do 

aquecimento global é considerado uma das maiores ameaças ambientais do século XXI.  As alterações 

climáticas, impulsionadas pelas atividades antropogénicas, terão consequências transversais a várias 

áreas da sociedade particularmente na economia, na saúde e no ambiente, sendo urgente medidas 

mitigadoras para que estes impactos não se agravem nas próximas décadas. De acordo com os cenários 

previstos, é muito provável que no futuro para além do aumento da temperatura média global, ocorra 

um aumento do nível médio do mar e um incremento na frequência e duração de fenómenos climáticos 

extremos, incluindo secas, cheias, precipitação intensa e ondas de calor. Consequentemente, as 

alterações climáticas irão afetar profundamente os ecossistemas a nível global, em especial os 

ecossistemas costeiros.  

Os Estuários são zonas húmidas costeiras muito ricas do ponto de vista biológico, onde ocorre 

grande mistura de água doce e água salgada que facilita a acumulação de sedimentos, nomeadamente 

nas zonas de sapal. As zonas estuarinas, devido à sua localização privilegiada e riqueza biológica, têm 

atraído, desde sempre, a população humana para as suas margens, servindo de localização para as 

maiores metrópoles do mundo. As ações antrópicas que, consequentemente, desde há várias décadas, 

estas regiões têm conhecido, de que são exemplos a exploração excessiva de recursos haliêuticos, o 

lançamento de resíduos sólidos, a eutrofização causada pela entrada de matéria orgânica, a dragagem e 

a introdução de espécies invasoras, têm causado impactos negativos. Os sapais têm grande interesse do 

ponto de vista económico, social e ecológico, prestando serviços de proteção à erosão costeira e à subida 

do nível do mar, estabilização de sedimentos, habitat para uma diversa variedade de espécies, 

purificação e retenção de água, remoção e transformação de nutrientes, oportunidades educacionais e 

recreativas, entre outros, pelo que a sua conservação tem, pois, elevada importância. As plantas de sapal, 

nomeadamente plantas halófitas, são de um modo geral, tal como o nome indica, extremamente 

resistentes a elevadas concentrações de sal, e a vários stresses ambientais, tais como contaminação de 

metais pesados, inundações e eventos térmicos extremos. Contudo, apesar da resiliência demonstrada 

por estas plantas, as alterações climáticas acopladas com as pressões antrópicas terão um profundo 

impacto nos sapais costeiros. A resistência e a tolerância das plantas halófitas varia consoante a espécie 

e o tipo de stress, ou seja, quando expostas a determinados cenários as espécies mais resistentes às novas 

condições adquirem vantagem em relação às outras, o que poderá alterar a distribuição e frequências 

das espécies dentro do sapal. 

No entanto, espécies com uma ampla distribuição geográfica e uma grande capacidade de 

adaptação e aclimatação revelam, normalmente, variações morfológicas, fenológicas e fisiológicas entre 

populações, de acordo com os condicionamentos locais. Estas plantas podem apresentar, desta forma, 

tolerância cruzada o que permite aumentar a resistência a uma gama de diferentes stresses após a 

exposição a um específico stress.  Adicionalmente, as plantas, devido à heterogeneidade ambiental, 

podem exibir variações intraespecíficas que iram influenciar a maneira como cada população irá 

responder a futuras alterações climáticas. Deste modo, as consequências diretas das mudanças climáticas 

podem ter diferentes impactos nas plantas de sapal que apresentam variações intraespecíficas, podendo 

afetar, de diferente modo, a estrutura e função destas comunidades.

Esta tese tem como principais objetivos investigar de que modo, desde logo, o pré-

condicionamento abiótico encontrado em diferentes populações de halófitas vai influenciar as suas 

respostas ecofisiológicas a stresses abióticos, conjeturados pelas previsões locais das alterações 

climáticas, e, ainda, se estas apresentam uma tolerância cruzada suficientemente significativa de modo 

a determinar a maneira como o sapal irá evoluir e que consequências ecológicas que poderá sofrer.  

Mais concretamente, pretendeu-se compreender as consequências das variações 

intraespecíficas, induzidas por pré-condicionamento, apresentadas pelas populações de duas espécies de 

halófitas com uma ampla distribuição geográfica, a C3 Halimione portulacoides e a invasora C4 Spartina 

patens, que colonizam dois sapais vizinhos no estuário do Tejo com diferentes níveis de metais pesados, 

numa primeira abordagem, face a um aumento de temperatura e numa segunda abordagem, face a um 

aumento de salinidade. 

O estudo da influencia da tolerância cruzada ao stress de calor constituiu a primeira abordagem 

para compreender as variações ecofisiológicas nas respostas das populações pré-condicionadas e não 

pré-condicionadas a metais pesados de H. portulacoides e S. patens a eventos de calor. Para tal e segundo 

o “Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change”, que indica, com grande certeza, que a frequência e a 

intensidade dos eventos de calor aumentarão devido ao fenómeno do aquecimento global, as plantas 

foram expostas a um tratamento de calor durante uma semana e, seguidamente, as suas respostas 

fisiológicas e bioquímicas foram profundamente analisadas. De acordo com os resultados apresentados 

na tese, obtidos através de medições fotobiológicas, de atividade enzimática e ocorrência de peroxidação 

lipídica, acoplando com as analises aos pigmentos e ácidos gordos, a tolerância cruzada indica que o 

pré-condicionamento a metais pesados influencia significativamente os mecanismos de tolerância ao 

stress térmico das plantas halófitas. Constatou-se que H. portulacoides pré-condicionado por metais 

pesados, por tolerância cruzada, apresenta maior resistência ao stress de calor que o H. portulacoides 

do sapal não contaminado, por outro lado S. patens, quando pré-condicionada por metais pesados, exibe 

uma pior performance na presença deste stress. 

Posteriormente estudou-se a influencia do pré-condicionamento a metais pesados na tolerância 

a aumentos de salinidades em duas populações de H. portulacoides e S. patens. A salinidade devido às 

alterações climáticas, acabará por crescer em consequência do aumento de eventos de tempestade, de 

ondas de maré e o do nível médio do mar. Ao contrario da maioria das plantas, as halófitas podem viver 

e prosperar em solos com salinidades até 855 mM, contudo as espécies halófitas têm respostas dispares 

à mesma salinidade, abrangendo espécies cujo desempenho óptimo ocorre em ambientes sem sal até 

espécies onde ambientes altamente salinos são ideais. Sendo assim, indivíduos das populações de H. 

portulacoides e S. patens dos sapais referidos anteriormente foram expostos a uma variedade de 

salinidades (0 mM NaCl, 400 mM NaCl, 800 mM NaCl) durante uma semana e logo após o tratamento 

foram analisadas fisiológica e bioquimicamente. Os resultados, adquiridos através dos mesmos métodos 

usados no estudo anterior, mostram que o pré-condicionamento de metais pesados tem um papel 

significativo na forma como as plantas responderam aos stresses. Através disso, verificou-se que S. 

patens pré-condicionado a metais pesados apresentou um maior fitness aos ambientes salinos, 

comparando com a população do sapal não contaminado, no entanto H. portulacoides manifestou uma 

complexa influência não linear à tolerância cruzada, uma vez que exibiu, quando pré-condicionado, uma 

performance pior quando exposto a 400 mM NaCl enquanto a 800 mM NaCl apresentou um melhor 

desempenho.   

Em resumo, é evidente que a halotolerância e a termotolerância das plantas anteriormente 

estudadas estão claramente interligadas com o seu pré-condicionamento, apresentando uma tolerância 

cruzada significativa, que vai ter um potencial impacto ecológico e poderá influenciar a forma como 

dois sapais vizinhos irão evoluir. Assim sendo, assumindo que as condições a que as plantas foram 

expostas representam as condições que, fruto das alterações climáticas, existirão no futuro, podemos 

constatar que o sapal contaminado poderá ser mais resistente à invasão por parte do S. patens do que o

sapal não-contaminado, quando impactados por eventos de calor e evidencia, também, ser em geral mais 

resiliente ao aumento de salinidade. 

Em conclusão, os resultados deste estudo mostram que o pré-condicionamento induz uma 

complexa variação intraespecífica nos mecanismos de tolerância aos stresses abióticos. Esta variação 

intraespecífica pode afetar significativamente a maneira como as comunidades de sapais irão evoluir no 

futuro, podendo influenciar, a estrutura e função de cada sapal. Assim, este estudo contribuiu com 

informação relevante para o conhecimento de processos ecofisiológicos e pode ser pertinente para 

modelar e prever possível cenários das mudanças climáticas nos sapais, assim como pode ter interesse 

para uma gestão de ações de conservação mais eficiente e especificas para cada sapal.

Abstract 

 
 Climate change is having an increasing effect worldwide, causing weighty disturbances 

in virtually all ecosystems thru arising abiotic variations. Salt marshes ecosystems, although highly 

resilient, are no exception to the climate shift consequences. Considering halophyte communities 

resistence and tolerance to abiotic alterations, climate change still makes them vulnerable to dire 

consequences in their productivity, ending up upsetting the distribution and biodiversity of marsh 

vegetation, compromising their economic, social and ecological services and unique role as the "Kidneys 

of the planet".  

This project aimed to determine heavy metal cross-tolerance thru pre-conditioning to abiotic 

stresses in halophyte plants. Analyzing the influence that adaptations to local conditions have in 

tolerance and resistance mechanisms and if this will be relevant in the stress response to the abiotic 

variations predicted in the future climate change and what could this mean for the shifting ecosystems. 

For this, it was studied the physiological responses to abiotic stresses in two different populations of the 

wide spread halophyte species, the native C3 Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4 Spartina 

patens, from nearby salt marshes in the Tagus estuary, with the major difference between them being 

heavy metal soil content.  

Firstly, on the basis that the frequency and intensity of warming events will rise, in duration and 

frequency, due to global warming, the halophyte plant groups where exposed to a warming event and 

then analyzed photobiologically and biochemically. The cross-tolerance results shown that heavy metal 

pre-condition enhanced the heat resistance mechanisms in H. portulacoides and worsened S. patens 

ability to cope with these changes, when compared to their non-pre-conditioned counterparts. This can 

have important consequences in the way the non-contaminated and heavy metal contaminated salt 

marshes will react to environmental changes, that can lead to possibly different ecological consequences. 

Considering the predicted climate change scenarios, it can be claimed that the contaminated marsh can 

be more resistant to invasion than the pristine marshes, were the warming events will benefit the exotic 

S. patens in relation to the native H. portulacoides.  

Secondly and taking in to consideration that land salinization is an increasing problem around 

the world and climate change will intensify this phenomenon especially in coastal lands, due to tidal 

surges, storm surges and sea level rise coupled with the increasing evaporation because of global 

warming, the halophyte species from both the studied salt marshes were exposed to a variety of salt 

treatments. When analyzed, the results exposed a noteworthy influence that the heavy metal pre-

conditioned has in the salinity stress responses.  In view of the future changes, it can be argued that 

heavy metal contaminated marshes are less resistant to the S. patens increasing colonization when 

exposed intermediate salt concentrations and in high salinities both H. portulacoides and S. patens have 

overall better salinity tolerance than their counterparts from the non-contaminated marsh. 

Concluding, this work shows that the heavy metal pre-conditioning has a complex and 

considerable influence in the plants tolerance and resistance mechanisms to several abiotic stresses, 

presenting an intraspecific physiological variation that can impact how the halophyte communities will 

respond to the upcoming environmental changes. According to our research it can be said that the heavy 

metal contaminated salt marsh will present significantly different ecological damages than their 

neighboring salt marsh.  

 

Key words: Halimione portulacoides, Spartina patens, salinity stress, warming stress, local 

adaptation, intraspecific variability, salt marshes, halophytes.

General Introduction 

 
Global warming is one of the biggest threats to the environment in the XXI century. Planet earth 

is undergoing a clear shift in the climate system, with major consequences to various areas of our society, 

for instance, economic, social and more importantly environmental. According to the Intergovernmental 

Panel on Climatic Change Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the influence of human activity in the global 

climate change is undeniable and growing. Human population and economic growth, has been the 

foremost cause of the warming observed since mid-20th century mainly due the greatly increased 

emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), observed in the unprecedented increase of the of 

carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations, leading to an energy uptake, translated to a 

warming of the climate system (IPCC, 2014). Global warming, if mitigation efforts are not conceived, 

is expected to cause further alterations to virtually all Earth environments. Under this, very likely, 

scenario it is predicted a warming of the global mean surface temperature, rising of the global mean sea 

level rising, as well as an increase, both in intense and frequency, of extreme climate events such as heat 

waves, droughts and very large precipitation events, both in intense and frequency (Pörtner et al., 2007; 

IPCC, 2014). Consequently, the climate change is very likely to alter the geographical distribution of 

entire ecological systems and the variability and distribution of the species they housed. 

Wetlands are known for being one of the more complex and important ecosystems worldwide, 

working as an interface between the terrestrial and aquatic environments, that occur in intertidal areas, 

and are providers of a wide range of essential ecosystem services (Larson et al., 1989). However, 

recently published estimates show that 64% of the world's wetlands have disappeared since 1900 

(Ramsar, 2013). Estuaries are coastal wetlands were the flow of fresh water from the rivers meets the 

salt water of the sea. These ecosystems are characterized by wide environmental fluctuations (tidal cycle, 

salinity, temperature, etc.) however, plants and animals of these ecosystems are perfectly adapted to 

endure and thrive under this, normally difficult, abiotic conditions, in fact, estuaries are among the 

planet's most productive ecosystems, even when compared to tropical forests (Longhurst et al., 1995). 

As a result of their privileged localization, unique characteristics and natural richness the estuaries 

locations have, since the beginning of civilization, attracted human populations, according to the 

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, USA), thirty-two of the largest cities in the 

world are located on the coast of an estuary. Consequently, this region has suffered negative impacts 

brought through the anthropogenic action such as dredging, eutrophication due to the input of organic 

matter and nutrients (N and P), excessive siltation due to the intense construction activity, pollution by 

solid waste, such as plastic and other debris and excessive exploitation of fishery resources, as well as 

introduction of invasive species (Carter and Woodroffe, 1995). Salt marshes, characterized by their 

halophyte vegetation, are established in low hydrodynamism estuarine areas and known for providing 

important ecological and economical services. During tidal flooding, the sediments are trapped by the 

vegetation when entering the marsh network causing marsh elevation, capturing the excesses contained 

in the environment, storing pollutants and metabolizing them, for this reason they are considered the 

"Kidneys of the planet" due to their important unique role in water purification (Teixeira et al., 2014). 

Even though, in the past, salt marshes had been categorized as mere wastelands, nowadays their global 

status as a unique ecotone recognized for their key ecological and economical importance, providing 

services regarding coastal erosion and sea-level rising protection, sediment stabilization, habitat for a 

diverse range of species, water purification and retention, removal and transformation of nutrients, 

educational and recreational opportunities (Teixeira et al., 2014; Duarte et al., 2017). These aspects 

reinforce the interest of these unique systems, in being preserved, used and fostered, either in the 

currently existing marshes and in the creation of others (Catarino, 1981), since they are considered 

natural methods that contribute to the removal of pollutants, leaving wastewater in better condition.

Halophyte vegetation, characteristic to salt marshes, is, by definition, salt-resistant or salt-

tolerant plants that can grow and complete their life cycles in soils or waters containing high salt 

concentrations. These plants present physiological and morphological adaptations that make them able 

to thrive in typically highly stressful environments, they are found subjected to elevated levels of abiotic 

stresses, displaying considerable tolerance to heavy metal pollution, salinity, extreme thermal events 

and flooding (Duarte et al., 2013a; 2013b; 2014; 2015). Despite high salt content in the vegetal tissues, 

they have a high potential for utilization being a cash crop with a numerous economic and ecological 

applications and purposes, such as food, fodder, coastal protection and desert revegetation (Lieth et al., 

1999; Lieth and Mochtchenko, 2002). Mediterranean salt marshes are dominated by halophyte plants 

like the perennial C3-succulent Halimione portulacoides L. Aellen, and the invasive C4-grass Spartina 

patens Ait. Muhl. This plants occupy different vegetation zones within the marsh, being normaly found 

in the high-marsh and low-marsh respectively. The predicted climate change will have a profound 

physiological impact in the salt marsh halophytes communities (Simas et al., 2001). Nevertheless, 

halophyte species present different resistances and tolerances to various stresses and, if so, they will 

have unalike responses to the abiotic changes fomented by global warming, moreover it is known that 

intraspecific variation as a significant expression within species, especially in wide-raging and highly 

tolerant species, that due to environmental pre-conditioning and acclimation to the different abiotic 

conditions presented in their various habitats can show physiology, morphology, and phenology 

adaptations (Valladares et al., 2007).  Therefore, the direct consequences of climate change can have 

different impacts on the distribution and biodiversity of the species within salt marshes, possibly due to 

intraspecific variation. 

This project, focused on two salt marshes found in the Tagus Estuary, Alcochete marsh and the 

Rosário marsh, where the degree of heavy metal contamination (Table 1.1) is the only presumed 

different abiotic condition between them. Alcochete salt marsh is located in the northern part of the 

Tagus Estuary within the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. Rosário salt marsh is located bellow in the 

estuary, near the ancient industrial axis Seixal-Montijo. Alcochete is considered a reference site with 

sediment metal concentrations very low (Vinagre et al. 2008; Caçador et al. 2009), whereas Rosário salt 

marsh has high levels of metal contamination in its sediments (Duarte et al. 2010).

The main goal of this study was to investigate the influence heavy metal pre-conditioning 

histories in the ecophysiological response in two neighboring salt marshes to the abovementioned abiotic

salinity of two wide spread halophyte species, C3 H. portulacoides and C4 S. patens, present in both

heavy metal contaminated and non-contaminated salt marshes, were evaluated. Considering the IPCC 

climate change prediction, this understanding is especially important in order to predict future changes 

in salt marshes, from an ecosystem approach to a population level.

Abstract 
 

Salt marshes are wetlands, worldwide recognized as for their unique and important ecological 

role. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change, the frequency and intensity of 

extreme heat events will rise because of the global warming phenomenon. Halophyte plants, 

characteristic of the salt marshes and known for being highly tolerant to various abiotic stressors, 

nonetheless, heat stress will have a negative impact on the individual when exposed to these warming 

events, however, it has been acknowledged that the tolerance response is different from species to 

species but also between same species populations. Intraspecific physiological variation is, usually, 

further expressed in wide ragging species possibly due to their pre-conditioned history. The present 

work aims to determine if C3-succulent Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4-grass Spartina 

patens have been conditioned to exhibit different heat tolerance within comparable same specie 

populations from adjacent locations with unlike soil contamination background. Through physiology 

and the photobiology analyses of warming treated samples, cross-tolerance results indicate that heavy 

metal pre-conditioning significantly influence the heat stress tolerance of the tested halophyte plants. 

Halimione portulacoides from a heavy metal contaminated salt marsh and S. patens from a non-

contaminated salt marsh appear to be better prepared to the upcoming consequences of the climate 

change, demonstrating a higher fitness level to warming events. Thus, the pre-conditioning influence 

over the tolerance mechanisms can affect the way in which salt marsh communities will evolve in the 

future, possibly being different through salt marshes. The contaminated marsh can be more resilient to 

invasion than the non-contaminated marsh, since the native species as benefited while the exotic was 

impaired from the heavy metal pre-conditioning. 

 

Key words: Halimione portulacoides, Spartina patens, warming stress, thermal stress, local 

adaptation, intraspecific variability, Alcochete salt marsh, Rosário salt marsh.

Introduction 
 

Wetlands systems are known to have a worldwide high economic value and ecological 

importance, encompassing a large scope of ecosystem services (Larson et al., 1989; Woodward et al., 

2001). Within wetlands, salt marshes are providers of various and unique globally relevant ecological 

and economic services, varying from wildlife conservation and costal defense to water purification 

(Teixeira et al., 2014; Duarte et al., 2017). Usually located within marine transitional systems, normally 

densely populated and industrialized areas, the marsh ecosystem is typically dominated by flora adapted 

to stressful environments. Halophytes are the typical salt marsh colonizers due to their high tolerance to 

varied abiotic stresses, like flooding (Duarte et al., 2014a), high salinity (Duarte et al., 2013a), heavy 

metal pollution (Duarte et al., 2013b) and extreme heat and cold events (Duarte et al., 2015a), presenting 

morphological and physiological adaptations that allows them to inhabit these adverse environments. 

The Tagus estuary is one of these complex systems, containing various salt marshes that are affected by 

various degrees of contamination, notably heavy metal contamination mostly due to local industrial 

exploration and anthropogenic pollution (Caçador et al., 1996; Caçador et al., 2009; Caçador et al., 

2012). Nonetheless, the various parts of the Tagus salt march environments and most of the 

Mediterranean salt marshes are abundantly colonized by the C3 succulent halophyte Halimione 

portulacoides (Chenopodiaceae) and the invasive grass C4 halophyte Spartina patens (Poaceae) original 

from the Atlantic Coast of North America, making then great marsh study specimens (Caçador et al., 

2013; Duarte et al., 2015b; Baumel et al., 2016a). 

Nowadays in the scientist community, there is a virtual consensus that recent and historical 

human activity is directly related to the observed climate change and to the unequivocal global warming. 

Global warming phenomenon is predicted to have a generally negative effect on plant growth due to the 

damaging effect of elevated temperatures on plant development (Hughes, 2000). Regarding the IPCC 

(Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change) 5th Assessment Report (AR5), climate change is 

described encompassing more than a century of data and analysis of the variations in temperature, 

precipitation, and atmospheric composition and the several other relevant factors, represents a rather 

complex and tough forecast for the local abiotic changes, impacting differently the various world 

ecosystems and their related plants. This climate change is translated into a global warming that will 

result in a doubtlessly 1.0 to 3.7 °C increase of the world’s average surface temperature and a surge in 

heat waves events both in frequency and duration (Meehl et al., 2007). Heat wave events, as defined by 

the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is a 5º Celsius rise of the local maximum temperature 

for six or more successive days, being the normal temperatures constructed defined during between 

1960-1991.  

Heat stress, in comparison to the other main natural occurring abiotic stresses, has an 

independent effect on the plant physiology and metabolism (Bita et al., 2013). Plant tolerance to 

warming stress is greatly different between species and can present relevant intraspecific variability, 

furthermore, this tolerance also varies, to a certain extent, with the plant development stage (Martin et 

al., 1999; Shah and Huang et al., 2011). At elevated temperatures, long-term exposure may cause 

injuries or death (Schoffl et al., 1999). Plants exposed to heat stress exhibit damages in various 

physiological mechanisms typically translated in the reduction of the photosynthesis activity (Duarte et 

al., 2015a, 2015c, 2016b), in the decrease of “usual” protein synthesis, in membrane decay (Weis and 

Berry, 1988; Larcher, 2003) among others, thus triggering physiological responses such as the 

transcription and translation of heat shock proteins (HSPs; Bray et al., 2000) and production of 

antioxidants and other protective molecules (Maestri et al., 2002). The temperature variation in the 

environment is sensed by the plants with stets of sensors. The increased fluidity of the membrane leads 

to activation of lipid-based signaling cascades and to an increased Ca2+ influx and cytoskeletal 



 

10 

 

reorganization (Saidi et al., 2009). Although the biological behavior and responses to warming are 

similar between plants, responses to this stressor can vary throughout same species populations. This 

intraspecific physiological variation can be observed in a wide range of highly tolerant species, that 

possibly due to different pre-conditioning (Gratani and Crescente, 1997; Valladares et al., 2007). 

Nevertheless, diverse studies indicate significant levels of interpopulation responses variability and little 

intrapopulation differentiation (Jump and Penuelas, 2005).  

In sum, this study intends to evaluate the effects of heavy metal-induced pre-conditioning on 

warming stress responses in two, C3 and C4 widespread, halophytes from two salt marsh populations. 

Using warming-induced changes in two halophytes populations with different pre-conditioning histories 

(heavy metal contaminated land versus non-contaminated environment) allowed to explore the different 

warming tolerances by analyzing the significant physiological variances in the response to the elevated 

temperatures, which can show intraspecific variation probably due to habitat variation. Considering the 

global warming projected by the IPCC report it becomes of foremost importance to identify and assess 

functional traits in which environmental variability has a significant role in how the species respond to 

global and local change.

Study Area and Sampling 

 

This study sampling was carried out on the Tagus estuary (Figure 2.1), located in the western 

coast of Portugal (38°44?N, 9°03? W), one of the larger estuaries in occidental Europe with an area of 

approximately 320 km2. The estuary involves a watershed superior to 80,000 km2 in Spain and Portugal 

territories, being the second most significant hydrological basin in whole Iberian Peninsula. 

Halimione portulacoides and Spartina patens sampling was done during low tide in the southern 

part of the Tagus estuary on the same day and tidal period, in Alcochete salt marsh (38°45'N, 8°56'W) 

situated within the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve and Rosário salt marsh (38°40'N, 9°01'W) in the 

vicinity of a large industrial complex (Figure 2.1). Samples were stored in well-identified plastic bags 

and quickly brought to the Marine Botany laboratory, at the Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre 

(MARE) site in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon.  

In the laboratory, plant samples were gently washed to remove dust and sediments. In order to 

make steam cuttings from H. portulacoides samples, the roots and part of the stems were cut, leaving at 

least two nods in the stem below the lowest branch for the development of grafts. The props were 

hydroponically cultured in dark-walled vases filled with modified ¼ Hoagland nutrient solution 

(Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). Spartina patens intact tussocks were set in pots filled with perlite and 

irrigated with ¼ Hoagland nutrient solution. Both plant samples were placed in a fitoclimatic chamber 

programmed to simulate a natural light environment using a sin function (maximum PAR 300 µmol 

photons m2 s-1, 16/8 h day/night rhythm, 20/18 ºC day/night temperature amplitude). Plants were kept 

under this condition for 2 months to acclimate to the new environment and allow root biomass growth 

in H. portulacoides.

Experimental setup 

 

After the adaptation period, plants of both species (H. portulacoides and S. patens) and 

population (Alcochete and Rosário) were separated into 2 groups with 5 replicates (Table 1) and 

subjected to different thermal treatments (day/night): control (20/18ºC) and warming treatment 

(35/30ºC) in a FitoScope 130 RGBIR chamber (Photon System Instruments, Czech Republic) with 

temperature rise and falls simulating the natural day (maximum PAR 300 µmol photons m2 s-1, 16/8 h 

day/night rhythm). In both treatments the plants sustained with ¼ Hoagland nutrient solution periodic 

irrigation. Treatment trials lasted for 7 days, after which the plants were harvested. All leaf samples for 

biochemical measurements and analysis were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (N2) and 

stored at -80ºC. Leaf samples harvested for fatty acid analysis were weighed before freezing.

Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry 

 

Modulated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made in attached leaves with a 

FluoroPen FP100 PAM (Photo System Instruments, Czech Republic). All the measurements in the dark-

adapted state were made after darkening of the leaves for at least 30 min. The minimal fluorescence (F0) 

in darkadapted state was measured by the measuring modulated light, which was sufficiently low (&amp;lt;0.1 

µmol m-2 s-1) not to induce any significant variation in fluorescence. The maximal fluorescence level 

(FM) in dark-adapted state was measured by a 0.8 second saturating pulse at 8000 µmol m-2 s-1. The 

maximum photochemical efficiency was assessed as (FM-F0)/FM. The same parameters were also 

measured in light –adapted leaves, being F’0 the minimum fluorescence, F’M the maximum fluorescence 

and the operational photochemical efficiency. Rapid light curves (RLC) measurements, in dark-adapted 

leaves, were attained using the preprogramed LC1 protocol of the FluoroPen, consisting in a sequence 

of pulses from 0 to 500 µmol m-2 s-1. Shortly, this protocol is based in successive measurements of the 

sample ?PS II under various light intensities (20, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500 ?mol m
-2 s- 1) of continuous 

illumination relating the rate of photosynthesis to photon flux density (PAR). During this protocol the 

F0 and FM as well as the maximum photochemical efficiency were measured. Each ?PS II measurement 

was used to calculate the electron transport rate (ETR) through photosystem II using the following 

equation: ETR = ?PS II x PAR x 0.5, where PAR is the actinic photosynthetically active radiation 

generated by the FluoroPen and 0.5 assumes that the photons absorbed are equally partitioned between 

PS II and PSI (Genty et al., 1989). Without knowledge of the actual amount of light being absorbed, 

fluorescence measurements can only be used as an approximation for electron transport (Beer et al., 

1998a, Beer et al., 1998b and Runcie and Durako, 2004). Rapid light curves (RLC) were generated from 

the calculated ETRs and the irradiances applied during the rapid light curve steps. Each RLC was fitted 

to a double exponential decay function in order to quantify the characteristic parameters, alpha and 

ETRmax (Platt et al., 1980). The initial slope of the RLC (?) is a measure of the light harvesting efficiency 



 

13 

 

of photosynthesis and the asymptote of the curve, the maximum rate of photosynthesis (ETRmax), is a 

measure of the capacity of the photosystems to utilize the absorbed light energy (Marshall et al., 2000). 

The onset of light saturation (Ek) was calculated as the ratio between ETRmax and ?. Excitation light of 

650 nm (peak wavelength) from array of three light and emitting diodes is focused on the surface of the 

leaf to provide a homogenous illumination. Light intensity reaching the leaf was 3000 µmol m-2 s-1, 

which was sufficient to generate maximal fluorescence in all individuals. The fluorescence signal is 

received by the sensor head during recording and is digitized in the control unit using a fast-digital 

converter. The OJIP transient (or Kautsky curves) depicts the rate of reduction kinetics of various 

components of PS II. When dark-adapted leaf is illuminated with the saturating light intensity of 3500 

µmol m-2 s-1 then it exhibits a polyphasic rise in fluorescence (OJIP). Each letter reflects distinct 

inflection in the induction curve. The level O represents all the open reaction centres at the onset of 

illumination with no reduction of QA (fluorescence intensity lasts for 10 ms). The rise of transient from 

O to J indicates the net photochemical reduction of QA (the stable primary electron acceptor of PS II) to 

QA? (lasts for 2 ms). The phase from J to I was due to all reduced states of closed RCs such as QA? QB?, 

QA QB
2? and QA? QB H2 (lasts for 2–30 ms). The level P (300 ms) coincides with maximum 

concentration of QA? QB
2 with plastoquinol pool maximally reduced. The phase P also reflects a balance 

between light incident at the PS II side and the rate of utilization of the chemical (potential) energy and 

the rate of heat dissipation (Zhu et al., 2005). 

 

 

Pigment profiling 

 

Pigments analysis used the previously harvested H. portulacoides and S. patens leaf samples 

that were flash-frozen and stored at -80ºC. The samples were then freeze-dried in the dark during 48h 

on a Telstar laboratory freeze dryer (Cryodos-45). Subsequently, the freeze-dried leaf samples were set 

into their respectively appropriately labeled plastic test tube, with the help of a glass rod, ground into a 

powder and afterward it was added 5ml of pure acetone. To ensure complete disaggregation of the leaf 

material, the test tubes containing the samples were then subjected to a cold ultra-sound bath for at least 

2-min. The samples were immediate, stored at -20ºC freezer and the pigments were extracted for 24h, 

samples were kept in in the dark to prevent pigment degradation. Following the extraction, the samples 

were placed in a centrifuge set at 4000 rpm at 4ºC and centrifuged for 15min. After which, samples were 

scanned from 350 nm to 750 nm in 1 nm steps, using a dual beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV/VIS 

UV1601 Spectrophotometer). Finally, the detected pigment sample absorption spectra were analyzed 

and quantified employing Gauss-Peak Spectra (GPS) method (Kupper et al., 2007). The sample 

spectrum was analyzed, through the GPS fitting library, using SigmaPlot Software. This method is based 

on the sample spectrum fitting, by a linear combination, to the Gauss-peak spectra, that describes each 

pigment in the detected spectrum, identifying the samples pigment profile, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, 

autoxantihin, antheraxanthin, ?-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin. 

For a better evaluation of the light harvesting and photoprotection mechanisms, the De-

Epoxidation State (DES) was calculated as: 

DES= ([Antheraxanthin]+[Zeaxanthin]) / ([Violaxanthin] + [Antheraxanthin] + [Zeaxanthin])

Leaf fatty acid composition 

 

Leaf fatty acid analyses were performed by direct trans-esterification of the previous weighed 

leaf samples as previously described (Matos et al., 2007; Duarte et al., 2017). First, leaf samples were 

placed into the glass tubes, in a water bath set at 70 ºC, containing the internal standard heptadecanoate 

(C17:0), methanol and sulphuric acid. Leaf samples were kept in the heated water bath, extracting for 

one hour after which were cooled down. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were extracted adding 

diethyl ether or light petroleum and water, subsequently centrifuged at 4000 rpm during 5 min. With the 

help of a glass Pasteur pipette, the upper layer was transferred to a test tube with a tapering bottom and 

eventually dried with the aid of a stream of nitrogen while heated by a water bath set to 37 ºC. After the 

completion of the evaporation, it was added of 50µl of hexane to the glass tube dry matter residue. 

Finally, the FAMEs were separated and identified, when injected 1 µl of the solution into the gas 

chromatograph (Varian 3900, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a hydrogen flame-ionization detector 

using a fused silica 0.25 mm i.d. x 50 m capillary column (WCOT Fused Silica, CP-Sil 88 for FAME; 

Varian). 

 

 

Anti-oxidant enzyme assays 

 

Enzyme extractions of H. portulacoides and S. patens leaf samples retrieved from their -80ºC 

storage were performed according to Tiryakioglu et al. (2006), at 4ºC. The fresh leaves were 

homogenized in 50mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) supplemented with 0.1 mM Na-EDTA in a 

ceramic mortar with a proportion of 500 mg to 8 ml respectively. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8 

923 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 °C, and the supernatant transferred to a test tube and used for the anti-

oxidant enzyme analyses.  

The enzyme activity measurements of catalase (CAT, EC.1.11.1.6.), Ascorbate peroxidase 

(APx, E.C. 1.11.1.11), Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, E.C. 1.11.1.7) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD E.C. 

1.15.1.1) were performed in a dual beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV/VIS UV1601 

Spectrophotometer) using quartz cuvettes. Catalase activity assays were performed according to the 

method of Teranishi et al. (1974). An aliquot of 100 µl of extract was added to the reaction solution, 

consisting in a mixture with 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM of Na-EDTA, and 

100 mM of H2O2, in order to start the reaction. Catalase activity was then measured by analyzing the 

capacity of H2O2 consumption during 60 seconds at 25 ºC, and consequent decrease in absorbance at 

240 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 39.4 mM-1 cm-1). Ascorbate peroxidase was measured according 

to Tiryakioglu et al. (2006), by observing the absorbance reduction, monitored at 290 nm for 60 seconds 

(molar extinction coefficient of 2.8 mM-1 cm-1). The reaction was initiated by adding 100 µl of the plant 

extract to the reaction mixture consisting in 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 12 mM of 

H2O2 and 0.25 mM L-ascorbate. Guaiacol peroxidase measurement was performed according to 

Bergmeyer (1974). A reaction solution was made, containing 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 

7.0), 50 mM of H2O2 and 100 µl of enzyme extract. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 20 

mM of guaiacol. The activity was recorded by an increase in absorbance during 60 seconds at 470 nm 

(molar extinction coefficient of 26.6 mM-1 cm-1). Superoxide dismutase total activity was assayed 

according to the method of Marklund (1974), by measuring the oxidation rate of pyrogallol monitored 

at 325 nm for 2 minutes. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 10 µL of enzyme extract to the 

reaction mixture, consisting of 50 mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM of Na-EDTA, 3 

mM of pyrogallol, ultrapure water. The autoxidation of pyrogallol was read without enzymatic extract 



 

15 

 

during the same period and time interval for comparison enabling. Protein quantification was determined 

using the Bradford (1976) method.  

 

Membrane lipid peroxidation 

 

Membrane lipid peroxidation quantification was performed in H. portulacoides and S. patens 

leaf samples according to Heath and Packer (1968). First, leaf sample matter was homogenized in 

previously made TBA/TCA solution, that contains 20% Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 0.5% 

Thiobarbituric acid (TBA), as a proportion of 100mg of leaf fresh weight to 2ml of acid solution. The 

homogenate was incubated during 30min at 95ºC, immediately after the extract was settled in ice in 

order to stop the reaction and placed in a centrifuge set at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 ºC. The absorbance 

was read at 532 nm and 600 nm in a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. Malondialdehyde (MDA) 

concentration was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient, 155 mM-1 cm-1 when applying the 

following equation: 

?532 ?? ?  ?600 ?? = [???]?? × ???? 

 

 

Statistical analysis 

 

Statistical analysis of the data derived from the previous analysis was made based on non-

parametric tests, due to a lack of normality and homogeneity. The resultant effects of warming 

treatments in the different populations and species were compared performing Kruskal-Wallis test using 

Statistica Software (Statasoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). Significant and highly significant values were assumed 

when the probability value (p-value) was smaller than 0,05 and 0,01 respectively.

H. portulacoides 

 
Halimione portulacoides samples of both population when subjected with warming conditions 

didn't showed any noteworthy changes in both maximum and operational quantum yields (Figure 2.2). 

However significant decreases were observed in the light-adapted variable fluorescence in the non-

contaminated site population (F’v; Figure 2.2). Additionally, dark-adapted variable fluorescence sowed 

decreases in the treated sample groups from both the populations, significant and highly significant in 

the plants from the non-contaminated and contaminated locations respectively (Fv; Figure 2.2).

S. patens 
 

Warming exposed S. patens PS II quantum efficiency results showed no meaningful change in 

PS II operational quantum yield in contaminated location samples under the two tested conditions, on 

the other hand, this parameter showed a significant increase in the non-contaminated site samples 

(Figure 2.3). An increase was detected in the PS II maximum quantum yield both populations, significant 

and highly significant in the samples from the non-contaminated and contaminated site respectively 

(Figure 2.3). Regarding leaf light and dark-adapted variable fluorescence, some differences could be 

found between the populations exposed to stress. Non-contaminated site population showed an increase 

in warming results in both variable while contaminated location samples showed a decrease in warming 

results, presenting a significant decrease in light-adapted fluorescence leaves (F'v; Figure 2.3). These 

plant groups showed comparable results in dark-adapted leaves, although no significant changes could 

be detected (Fv; Figure 2.3).

Rapid light curves 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Observing the rapid light curves and derived parameters in dark-adapted leaves of the H. 

portulacoides samples it could be observed an evident increase in the electron transport rates (rETR) 

under different light intensities in both populations exposed to warming stress (Figure 2.4). Additionally, 

results displayed significant increases on photosynthetic efficiency (?; Figure 2.4) and maximum 

electron transport rates (ETRmax; Figure 2.4) and a significant decrease in light saturation (Ek; Figure 

2.4) in warming stressed populations.

differences between treatments at *P&lt;0,05; **P&lt;0,01). 

 

S. patens 

 
Warming conditions in S. patens led to a visible increase in the electron transport rates in both 

populations. Increases were detected in photosynthetic efficiency (?; Figure 2.5) and maximum electron 

transport rates (ETRmax; Figure 2.5) and a decrease in light saturation (Ek; Figure 2.5) in both populations 

(Figure 2.5).  Nevertheless, these changes were not significant.

Kautsky curves and OJIP-test 

 

H. portulacoides 
 

Regarding H. portulacoides Kautsky plots, that provide a general view of the photochemical 

process in light harvesting to its dissipation, there was an evident decrease in fluorescence values in both 

populations subjected to warming treatment (Figure 2.6). For K-step, fluorescence at 300ms, peak 

amplitude (WK; Figure 2.6), it was observed decreases in amplitude in both warming stressed samples, 

especially in the contaminated site population, presenting a significant decrease. These same samples 

showed an accompanying decrease in the fraction of active oxygen-evolving complexes (Active OECs; 

Figure 2.6), presenting significance in the H. portulacoides from the heavy metal contaminated location.

error, N=5; asterisks marks significant differences between treatments at *P&lt;0,05; **P&lt;0,01). 

 

Concerning the energetic fluxes in H. portulacoides warming exposed leaves (Figure 2.7), it’s 

noticeable an evident and significant reduction in absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS; Figure 2.7) in 

warming treatment samples of both populations, connected to a decrease of the reaction centers available 

for reduction, significant and highly significant in the non-contaminated and contaminated site sample 

groups respectively (RC/CS; Figure 2.7) and trapped energy flux (TR/CS; Figure 2.7) and a similar 

significant decrease in electron transport energy flux (ET/CS; Figure 2.7). Nevertheless, the dissipation 

energy flux (DI/CS; Figure 2.7) increased in non-contaminated site plants and decreased in 

contaminated location samples.

Regarding the oxidized quinone pool from H. portulacoides leaves, it presented a significant 

size reduction in warming treated individuals from both locations (Figure 2.8). The total number of 

electrons transferred into the electron transport chain (N; Figure 2.8) and PS II antennae connectivity, 

through grouping probability (PG; Figure 2.8), exhibited an increase in the warming-exposed samples, 

although contaminated site population shown a comparatively greater decrease in N, possibly related 

with the also higher value observed in contaminated control. The net rate of PS II reaction centers closure 

(M0; Figure 2.8) showed an increase in the warming treated non-contaminated site samples, on the other 

hand, it was found a decrease in the contaminated location samples, although without statistical 

significance. Observing the electron movement efficiency from the reduced intersystem electron 

acceptors to the PS I end electron acceptors (?R0; Figure 2.8) it was found an increase in both population, 



 

22 

 

none the less both the control and the warming treated ?R0 value were lower in the H. portulacoides 

from the non-contaminated location.

S. patens 

 
Spartina patens Kautsky curves showed an evident decrease of relative fluorescence values in 

the warming treated curve of both population, with a more severe reduction in the heavy metal 

contaminated location samples (Figure 2.9), also of note, the fluorescence values of the control and 



 

23 

 

warming samples were meaningfully different, with the non-contaminated site population presenting 

higher fluorescence values. The K-step peak amplitude (WK; Figure 2.9) showed a significant decrease 

in the non-contaminated site samples, the same plant population showing a significant increase in active 

oxygen-evolving complexes (Active OECs; Figure 2.9).

N=5; asterisks marks significant differences between treatments at *P&lt;0,05; **P&lt;0,01). 

 

Regarding S. patens energy fluxes (Figure 2.10), a highly significant decrease was observed in 

the absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS; Figure 2.10), oxidized reaction centers (RC/CS; Figure 2.10), 

electron transport energy flux (ET/CS; Figure 2.10), dissipation energy flux (DI/CS; Figure 2.10) and a 

significant decrease in trapped energy flux (TR/CS; Figure 2.10) in the warming-exposed samples from 

the contaminated site. Spartina patens from the non-contaminated marsh also exhibited a reduction trend 

compared to the heavy metal pre-conditioned population in the energy fluxes values, although without 

statistical significance.

Warming exposed S. patens oxidized quinone pool size showed no meaningful changes in the 

samples from the non-contaminated site and a significant decrease in the heavy metal contaminated 

location samples (Figure 2.11). The total number of electron transferred into the electron transport chain 

(Figure 2.11) shown a decrease in both treated sample, however the decrease measured in the non-

contaminated site samples was significant. Net rate of PS II reaction centers closure (Figure 2.11) 

displayed no noteworthy changes. The grouping probability (Figure 2.11) exhibited a highly significant 

decrease in both warming exposed samples, reveling a rise in the PS II antennae connectivity. 

Additionally, the electron movement efficiency from the reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the 

PS I end electron acceptors only showed increase in S. patens from the non-contaminated location, when 

exposed to warming conditions.

Leaf pigment composition 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Regarding leaf pigments concentration in H. portulacoides, evident changes were detected 

(Figure 2.12). Highly significant decreases were found in the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a), 

chlorophyll b (Chl b) and total chlorophyll (Total Chl) in warming treated samples from both 

populations, however, was noticed that the contaminated location plants showed lower control 

concentration (Figure 2.12). Concerning each carotenoid individually, significant differences in 

concentration were noticed (Figure 2.12). When exposed to heat event, Auroxanthin and antheraxanthin 



 

26 

 

concentrations shown significant decreases, in the pre-conditioned samples, additionally auroxanthin 

displayed a significant rise in the non-contaminated site individuals. ?-carotene exhibit a significant 

decrease in both population, significant and highly significant in the non-contaminated and 

contaminated site sample groups respectively. Highly significant decreases were also observed in lutein, 

neoxanthin, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in both populations. Both sample groups showed a highly 

significant decrease in chlorophyll a/b ratio (Figure 2.13) as well as a significant increase in the total 

carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio (Figure 2.13) and in the chlorophyll degradation index (Figure 2.13). 

As for the de-epoxidation state (DES; Figure 2.13), index it was found a significant increase in the 

samples from the non-contaminated location. On the other hand, no visible changes were detected in the 

contaminated site population.

S. patens 

 
Considering the leaf pigments concentration in S. patens leaves, significant differences were 

detected between the populations from the contaminated and non-contaminated locations (Figure 2.14). 

There was a significant increase in chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and total chlorophyll 

(Total Chl) concentration in non-contaminated site samples. On the other hand, it was observed a highly 

significant decrease in chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll in samples from the heavy metal contaminated 

location. No visible changes could be detected in these warming treated samples regarding its 

chlorophyll b content (Figure 2.14). However, stressed leaf samples from both locations displayed a 

significant reduction on the chlorophyll a/b ratio, significant and highly significant in the plants from 

the non-contaminated and contaminated locations respectively (Figure 2.15). Regarding changes in 

individual carotenoid concentrations under warming conditions, noteworthy variations were also 

detected between the different populations (Figure 2.14).  Auroxanthin and antheraxanthin showed 

highly significant decreases in the warming exposed non-contaminated site samples. Both heat stressed 

S. patens groups showed a highly significant increase in ?-carotene and lutein pigment concentrations. 

Neoxanthin exhibit no changes in S. patens leaves from non-contaminated location, in contrast, a highly 

significant decrease was found in the contaminated site samples. On the other hand, violaxanthin appear 

to have no changes in contaminated site samples and a significant increase in the non-contaminated site 

sample group. Zeaxanthin also showed a significant increase in the S. patens from the non-contaminated 



 

28 

 

location and a significant decrease in the samples from the contaminated site. Concerning the total 

carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio in warming exposed leaves, it was found a significant decreased in 

non-contaminated site samples, on the other hand, heavy metal pre-conditioned samples exhibited a 

significant increase (Figure 2.15). Both populations samples showed a higher chlorophyll degradation 

index (Figure 2.15), being this highly significant in the contaminated site individuals. As for the de-

epoxidation state (DES) index, it was observed an increase in heavy metal contaminated location 

samples and a significant increase in the non-contaminated site population (Figure 2.15).

Anti-oxidant enzymes 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Overlooking the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, similar feedback patterns, but with some 

significance variances, were exhibited by the warming treated H. portulacoides from both locations 

(Figure 2.16). When exposed to warming, the leaf catalase (CAT) activity showed a significant decrease 

in both populations, a decrease was also observed in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol 

peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity, nonetheless significance was only present in the GPx of the non-

contaminated site samples (Figure 2.16). On the other hand, ascorbate peroxidase (APx) activity 

apparently showed a decrease in the non-contaminated site samples and an increase in the pre-

conditioned individuals (Figure 2.16). Considering leaves total protein content, a highly significant 

increment was seen in the H. portulacoides from the non-contaminated location alongside a non-

significant increase in the contaminated site group. In respect to the membrane lipid peroxidation content 

detected, namely MDA concentration in the leaf (Figure 2.16), no significant changes were observed in 

warming treated plants from both locations.

S. patens 

 
Warming treated S. patens exhibited highly different anti-oxidant enzyme patterns of activity 

from both locations plants (Figure 2.17). Warming diminishes highly significantly both populations leaf 

activity of APx, GPX, and SOD (Figure 2.17). CAT activity also decreased, significantly in the non-

contaminated location plants and highly significantly in the contaminated site samples (Figure 2.17). 

Regarding total protein content of the leaves, it was evidenced the highly significant increase in both 



 

31 

 

population due to warming stress. As for the membrane damage, evaluated by the leaf MDA 

concentration, there was a highly significant increase in both plant population (Figure 2.17).

Fatty acid composition 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Warming treatment showed significant changes in the fatty acid profile of both H. portulacoides 

populations (Figure 2.18). Palmitic acid (C16:0), linoleic acid (C18:2; omega-6 category) and linolenic 

acid (C18:3; omega-3 category) were the most abundant fatty acids detected in both control leaf samples. 

In warming stressed leaves, significant increases in Palmitic acid could be observed. Trans-delta 3-

hexadecenoic acid (C16:1t) in warming exposed H. portulacoides leaves showed a non-significant 

increase in the samples from non-contaminated location, however in contaminated site plants was shown 

a decrease. Hexadecatrienoic acid (C16:3) presented a significant decrease and increase in warming 

treated samples from non-contaminated and heavy metal contaminated location respectively. Warming 

exposed samples also presented significant increase in their respective proportion of oleic acid (C18:1) 

and a significant decrease in linolenic acid, both this value variations were more significant in the 

contaminated site sample group. Regarding the saturation classes, the changes in percentage detected, 

due to warming treatment, were clear (Figure 2.18). Saturated fatty acid presented a significant increase 

both treated groups as well as the monounsaturated fatty acids showed significant increase, while 

polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased significantly in both H. portulacoides population, however 

saturated and monosaturated variations were highly significant in samples from the heavy metal 

contaminated location.

The total fatty acid content in H. portulacoides the leaves showed similar responses to the 

warming treatment displaying significant and highly increase in the plant groups from the non-

contaminated and contaminated respectively. Also, to notice that the non-contaminated site population 

showed higher total fatty acid content in both control and warming measurements (Figure 2.19). When 

comparing the abundance of linoleic acid to linolenic acid (C18:2/C18:3; Figure 2.19) it showed a 

significant increase in both warming exposed populations. The double-bound index (DBI; Figure 2.19) 

shown a decrease in both populations, significant in H. portulacoides from the non-contaminated 

location and highly significant in the heavy metal pre-conditioned plants.

S. patens 

 
Spartina patens fatty acid content showed significant changes after warming treatment (Figure 

2.20). Like in H. portulacoides, the most abundant acids were palmitic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic 

acid nonetheless exhibited a bigger presence of stearic acid and pentadecylic acid. Warming stressed 

leaves evidenced a highly significant rise in pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid in both 

populations as well as a highly significant reduction in stearic acid. Uniquely, the non-contaminated site 

population samples showed a highly significant increase in linoleic acid and a highly significant decrease 

in hexadecatrienoic acid as well as a significant decreased in linolenic acid. Contaminated location S. 

patens leaves displayed a highly significant decreased in hexadecenoic acid. In respect to the saturation 

classes, the changes by warming stress only occurred meaningfully in monounsaturated fatty acids, 

shown highly significant increase in both plant population alike (Figure 2.20). Both saturated and 

polyunsaturated fatty acids did not display any noteworthy change in the warming exposed leaves.

The total fatty acid content exhibited a similar increase due to warming stress in both 

populations (Figure 2.21). The C18:2/C18:3 ratio showed a highly significantly increase in non-

contaminated site samples (Figure 2.21) however there were no variations in contaminated location 

samples after warming exposure. The double bound-index (DBI; Figure 2.21) showed no substantial 

changes in either non-contaminated or contaminated site populations.

Discussion 
 

According to the temperature records, human influenced a worldwide environmental change 

(IPCC, 2007). Since the mid-twentieth century the surge of extreme warming events is evident, and, in 

some places, this recurrence has doubled (IPCC, 2014). Twenty-first-century climate model projections 

concluded that the region that encompasses and surrounds the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East 

is a critical area with an immense propensity for environmental changes (Tanarhte et al, 2012; Zittis et 

al, 2016). Due to the future abiotic changes to the Mediterranean ecosystem, it is fair to assume 

inevitable imposition of environmental stresses that will alter the biodiversity and distribution of various 

ecosystems. As with any kind of new stressed environments, plants well adapted to harsh conditions, 

such as salt marsh flora, will be potentially more suitable to new climate realities (Duarte et al. 2013a, 

2014a, 2015). Plant populations exposed to land heterogeneity can have a different response when new 

stress factors are introduced. This can happen when comparing the responses between different 

conditioned species to different environments, for example, a pre-conditioned species to a more stressful 

environment may have acquired functional traits that may have a determinant role in plant response to 

global change, as well as on the ecological consequences at an ecosystem level for the competition 

between wild and invasive species (Parmasen, 2006; Matesanz et al., 2010). Considering this, 

environmental changes are impactful within ecosystems leading to potential modifications of the habitat 

available for colonization. This can happen in salt marshes settings where species distribution is 

frequently modulated by marsh elevation. The salt marsh zonation is based on their topography, 

classified and defining several distinct areas, the low, medium and high areas, directly related to yearly 

rate of tidal submergences (Adam, 1990), which is a crucial to marsh flora succession, affecting the 

sediment flooding, redox potential, pH and salinity (Silvestri et al., 2005). Nevertheless, warming events 

affect all the marsh flora indiscriminately. Assuming, based on the IPCC reports, that warming events 

will be more frequent and long it becomes important to address the physiological mechanisms that 

confer resistance and tolerance to warming stress and if this can be significantly influenced by pre-

conditioning to other stress. Comparing the physiological results of warming stress in two populations 

of two widely spread halophyte species, under different environmental pre-conditions provides essential 

information on plant response to new environmental factors fluctuations including climate change and 

the importance of intraspecific variability. 

Reviewing the photobiological light harvesting processes results, H. portulacoides populations 

presented similar responses to warming treatment, reflecting well-adjusted heat tolerance processes. 

There was no meaningful change in the photosystem II operational and maximum quantum yield. 

Furthermore, maximum electron transport rates (ETRmax) and general photosynthetic light harvesting 

efficiency (?) expanded significantly with warming treatment, bolstered by the relative electron 

transport rate at each light intensity (rETR). The chlorophyll fluorescence transient analysis suggests 

mechanisms that allow the maintenance of H. portulacoides photosynthetic efficiency. Nevertheless, it 

can be suggested that H. portulacoides population from the heavy metal contaminated location has a 

better performance when observing the slightly healthier values in the rapid light curves and derived 

parameters, such as the ETRmax and photosynthetic efficiency. This inference is supported by the lower 

energy dissipation values (DI/CS), indicating a higher efficiency in the electronic transport. The 

relationship between the active OECs increase and the K-step amplitude decrease found in the H. 

portulacoides from both locations when warming treated can be used as evidence of highly efficient 

mechanisms to the imposed stress, indicating as well that the oxygen evolving complex of PS II function 

was not damaged by the changed conditions (Duarte et al., 2016b), nonetheless, OECs and K-step 

amplitude showed significances in their variation in the warming treated contaminated site samples, 

possibly signifying a better OEC warming-stability. Still, the indication of warming stress damage is 



 

36 

 

reinforced by negative impacts relative to the decrease of the Kautsky curves in the warming exposed 

samples. Regarding warming stress effects on photosynthetic electron transport, the decrease of 

fluorescence in the Kautsky curves was the result of the decrease in quinone pool size. Quinone pool 

reduction in heat stressed leaves can be acquiescent examining the limitation of the electron transport 

rate, that in PS II acceptor side presented a significant reduction, considering the enactment of PS I 

cyclic electron transport. A cyclic flow is known to be essential for the maintenance of the correct ratio 

of ATP/NADPH production and the prevention of stroma over-reduction (Joly et al., 2007; Munekage 

et al., 2004; Pshybytko et al., 2008). Thus, warming stress consequences also revealed, in both H. 

portulacoides populations, a significant decrease in absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS), trapped energy 

flux (TR/CS), electron transport energy flux (ET/CS) and available reaction centers (RC/CS), 

nonetheless the decrease seen in the contaminated site population trapped energy flux and in their 

available reaction centers was less significative indicating a better warming tolerance, presenting less 

damage in overall energy fluxes. This can be supported by the visible increase in net rate of PS II reaction 

of RC closure in the samples from the non-contaminated location, in contrast to the decrease found in 

the heavy metal pre-conditioned samples (Chen and Cheng 2009). Furthermore, considering the 

damages in warming stress of the energy fluxes in PS II and the PS I energy flux enhancement, acquired 

by observing the increase displayed in ?R0 of both treated sample groups, it can be concluded that PS I 

is warming resistance in comparison to the more warming unstable PS II mechanisms (Duarte et al., 

2015a). Considering that H. portulacoides is native from the Mediterranean, from North Africa to Great 

Britain, is naturally adapted to warmer weather, this can explain the high physiological tolerance 

displayed by this species when exposed to heat events. 

PAM fluorometry acquired data, in both S. patens populations exposed to warming treatment, 

presented a significant rise in PS II maximum and operational quantum efficiency in both sample 

populations as well as a rise in photosynthetic efficiency and maximum electron transport rates. These 

responses indicated a well-adapted response to elevated temperatures as shown in previous studies 

(Duarte et al., 2016), this may be related to the fact that S. patens is a Tagus estuary invasive species 

that is originally from a relatively warmer climate (Lonard et al. 2010). In fact, nowadays it is accepted 

that the expansion of S. patens in Tagus estuary is slowed down by a climatic mischief of this specie to 

its new invaded environment (Duarte et al., 2015b) Concerning the photosynthetic electron transport 

chains in S. patens from the contaminated location, was observed a decrease in Kautsky curve 

fluorescence, possibly due to the detected decrease in the oxidized quinone pool size (Pshybytko et al., 

2008). Heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens’ oxygen evolving complexes (OECs) appear to be 

temperature insensitive, on the other hand, non-contaminated site population showed a decrease in K-

step amplitude and an increase in the number of active oxygen-evolving complexes, in fact, under heat 

stress K-step is exclusively related to PS II OECs (Srivastava et al., 1997), with this it can be assumed 

that S. patens from the non-contaminated location have a better performance under warming exposure. 

Also, results in phenomenological fluxes present significant variations between S. patens populations 

response to warming stress. There was found sight variations in warming exposed non-contaminated 

site samples, on the other hand, on S. patens from the contaminated location, possible due to quinone 

size reduction, showed a significant reduction of electron transport energy flux (ET/CS), absorbed 

energy flux (ABS/CS), trapped energy flux (TR/CS), available reaction centers (RC/CS) and energy 

dissipation values (DI/CS). This significantly different response should lead to bigger consequences in 

the population from the heavy metal contaminated location than those found in the analyses, however, 

when considering the substantially different phenomenological fluxes values found in the control 

populations, it was observed that the energy fluxes changes in contaminated site population result with 

similar values in both warming exposed population. Fluorescence measurements data provided evidence 

that S. patens from the non-contaminated and contaminated locations have similar performances when 

exposed to warming conditions, demonstrated by the evident increase in photosynthetic similarities in 



 

37 

 

warming adapted S. patens. However, it can be argued that the bigger variations detected in the 

phenomenological energy fluxes parameters of the heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens reveals a 

superior biological effort when responding to the warming stress compared to the population from the 

non-contaminated location. 

In halophytic species exposed to abiotic stresses, it is common to observe the activation of the 

xanthophyll cycle (Duarte et al., 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, 2016) a photoprotective mechanism, induced due 

to a crucial drop down in the luminal pH. The de-epoxidation of the luminal violaxanthin pool towards 

zeaxanthin reduces the overload of the photosynthetic light harvesting mechanism, through energy 

dissipation of excess reducing power accumulated within the stroma (Demmig-Adams, 1990). Heat 

stressed H. portulacoides showed a decrease in all carotenoids, except non-pre-conditioned individuals 

presented a significant increase in the concentration of auroxanthin, a violaxanthin analog that acts as 

an efficient energy quencher, however the highly significant increase of the DES index, known to be a 

evident signal of xanthophyll cycle activity, can possibly indicate a lesser presence of the xanthophyll 

cycle in the plants from the non-contaminated environment (Duarte et al., 2013a). The lack of activated 

carotenoids driven warming tolerance mechanisms in heavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides, 

did not appear to have any negative effects in the management of the LHC or in the photosynthetic 

efficiency, so it can be concluded that H. portulacoides from the contaminated location has better 

warming resistance. Nevertheless, both populations showed an increase in the total carotenoid to total 

chlorophyll ratio, indicating a plant activity shift from light harvesting to photoprotection (Wentworth 

et al., 2000). Warming exposed S. patens from the contaminated site showed xanthophyll cycle 

activation and activity shift to photoprotection due to total carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio rise, 

nonetheless xanthophyll cycle is defective according to the significant increase in DES, on the other 

hand, the non-contaminated site S. patens group conditions for xanthophyll cycle did not arise, however 

highly significant rises in ?-carotene and lutein pigment concentrations were observed in both 

populations, two typical anti-oxidant carotenoids acting as a possible countermeasure against ROS 

(Duarte et al., 2013a). Moreover, pre-conditioned S. patens exhibited a highly significant increase in the 

chlorophyll degradation index indicating a worse light harvesting stress response than in the non-

preconditioned individuals that presented no significant changes in the index when warming treated.  

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging analysis are of great consequence because 

environmental stresses can cause the accumulation of this reactive oxygen species in tissues being 

harmful to plants, thus their detoxification is of major importance to plant cell metabolism. In fact, ROS 

are routinely generated during normal cellular metabolic processes, yet they are also known to be 

signaling molecules that can activate physiological responses to many common and frequent abiotic 

stresses (Tripathy and Oelmüller, 2012). Throughout these pathways, plants have developed an effective 

antioxidative mechanism, with enzymatic components coupled with mechanism driven by pigment 

conversions (Jithesh et al., 2006). Nonetheless no warming treated sample groups, neither H. 

portulacoides nor S. patens, shown any active line of enzymatic defense. The reduction displayed in the 

anti-oxidant enzymes of the heat stressed S. patens led to a poor and inefficient scavenging mechanism 

of the ROS species, observed in the highly significant increase of the lipid peroxidation, an indicator of 

oxidative cellular damage. Furthermore, taking into consideration that the increase of lipid peroxidation 

is higher in the pre-conditioned samples, it can be argued that the S. patens population from the non-

contaminated marsh displays less damage and superior tolerance mechanisms to ROS. On the other 

hand, the defense against ROS species in H. portulacoides appears to be efficient due to the maintenance 

of the lipid peroxidation levels within warming exposed plants. However, non-pre-conditioned 

individuals presented the activation of the xanthophyll cycle couple with the increase production of 

auroxanthin to efficiently perform ROS scavenging, none the less the pre-conditioned individuals did 

not show significant anti-oxidant mechanisms, and with the reduction of auroxanthin, other common 



 

38 

 

ROS scavenging mechanism, it can be indicated that pre-conditioned H. portulacoides displays a better 

resistance then its counterpart from the non-contaminated location.  

Observing the plants fatty acid profile, we can confer that H. portulacoides and S. patens belong 

to 18:3 group of plants in terms of fatty acid metabolism. Halimione portulacoides warming-exposed 

populations presented similar fatty acid profile responses. Both populations shown a highly significant 

increase in oleic acid (C18:1), known for improving the stabilization of light-harvesting complex 

(Siefermann-Harms and Angerhofer, 1998). The findings corroborate the results that indicated light 

harvesting stress, shown in the decrease of the chl a/ chl b ratio and the increase of the above mentioned 

total carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio of the heat stressed H. portulacoides. When comparing the 

C18:1 to chl a/ chl b ratio there is a negative significant correlation (r2 = -0,84; P&lt;0,05) in the individuals 

from the non-contaminated marsh and (r2 = -0,89; P&lt;0,05) in the pre-conditioned samples, this suggests 

that in order to reduce LHC stress there is an increase in the synthetization of the oleic acid (Duarte et 

al., 2015c). Palmitic acid (C16:0), recognized for having a key role and integral part in PS II functioning 

(Gounaris and Barber, 1985) shown a highly significant increase. One of the typical heat stress 

manifestations is tissue senescence, characterized by cellular membrane damage linked to a fluidity 

increase of the membrane lipids, lipid peroxidation, and protein debasement in different metabolic 

procedures (Savchenko et al., 2002). The substantial decrease in linolenic acid (C18:3) happen due to 

the increase in the content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, in order to maintain membrane 

fluidity, adjusting their metabolism in direct response to the warming stress (Zhang et al.,2005). In this 

manner, the expansion of the saturation level of fatty acids seems, by all accounts, to be critical for the 

maintenance of the membrane stability and heat tolerance upgrading (Larkindale and Huang, 2004), 

nonetheless these fatty acid tolerance mechanisms when seen more efficient in the pre-conditioned 

individuals and coupled with the highly significant increase in the total fatty acid content, it can be 

argued that the H. portulacoides from the heavy metal contaminated salt marsh has a superior tolerance 

to heat stress. Warming feedbacks were similar between S. patens population, as well as no evident 

warming specific fatty acid indicator was shown, possibly indicating no membrane structural damage. 

Palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) suffered a significant rise, probably for the benefit of 

overall PS II function and more specific PS II light-harvesting complexes stabilization (Siefermann-

Harms and Angerhofer, 1998) respectively. Considering the warming stress in both populations, the 

LHC stress response were different between populations. Oleic acid when compared with chl a/b ratio, 

a common stress indicator, exhibited a negative correlation in the samples from the non-contaminated 

(r2 = -0,75; P&lt;0,05) and contaminated (r2 = -0,83; P&lt;0,05) locations, although non-pre-conditioned 

individuals also displayed an increase in carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio, indicating an enhancing the 

light harvesting efficiency and reducing the stress, to corroborated this findings it was found a positive 

correlation between C18:1 and chl a/b ratio in the individuals from the non-contaminated (r2 = 0,928; 

P&lt;0,05), in turn pre-conditioned samples as expected did not presented a correlation (r2 = 0,83; P&lt;0,05), 

the difference in LHC stress response is seen observing the chl a/b ratio decrease, that is significant and 

very significant in the S. patens from the non-contaminated and the heavy metal contaminated salt marsh 

respectively. Thru this data it can be claim that the non-pre-conditioned S. patens population as a 

superior warming stress response than its counterpart.

Conclusions 
 

The findings here obtained, support the understanding that halophyte plants are known to be 

tolerant to a wide range of abiotic stresses, possessing highly efficient mechanisms that allow them to 

colonize inherently hostile habitats just like the sampled salt marshes. This study has shown that thermal 

stress in both, the C3 Halimione portulacoides and the C4 Spartina patens, halophytes species presented 

a complex intraspecific variation of their biophysical stress responses imposed through environmental 

warming, related to local adaptation to other stress due to different habitat conditions presented in the 

populations.  

Our data suggest that although H. portulacoides from both populations showed overall negative 

impacts to warming events. Nonetheless, heavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides displayed less 

damage in the physiological and the photobiological mechanisms than its non-contaminated site 

counterpart, revealing to have better warming tolerance. Photobiological light harvesting processes 

appear to have a higher efficiency in the H. portulacoides from the heavy metal contaminated location, 

presenting less damage to the photosystem II electronic transport and energy flux. Considering 

photoprotective mechanisms, the xanthophyll cycle seems to be only needed in the non-contaminated 

site H. portulacoides, when observing no more damage or photoinhibition in H. portulacoides from the 

contaminated location it appears that non-contaminated site H. portulacoides are possibly more 

photosensitive. Spartina patens results suggests a high tolerance for temperature increase stress in both 

populations. Nonetheless, an argument can be made indicating a better and more efficient warming 

adaptation in S. patens sourced from the non- contaminated environment. Regarding photobiology, it 

can be detected an improvement in the PS II oxygen-evolving complexes in the non-contaminated site 

S. patens as well as being, apparently, warming insensitive, the same thus not applied in S. patens from 

the heavy metal contaminated location, presenting various significant photobiological mechanisms 

changes. The heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens, when comparing to S. patens from the non-

contaminated environment, also appear to show the poorest warming tolerance with an apparent photo-

oxidative stress vulnerability as well as a less competent reactive oxygen species scavenging 

mechanisms.  

Assuming that the IPCC predictions are accurate, the heat wave phenomenon will be 

substantially aggravated, in frequency and duration, by the ongoing climate change that is expected to 

have a great impact in plant distribution and abundance in the world’s salt marsh ecosystem, as well as 

plant community distribution (Walther et al., 2002). Different responses to extreme climate events can 

occur between plant species especially those that have a wide-ranging geographical distribution (Jump 

and Penuelas, 2005) just as the plant species addressed in this study. Our findings suggest that H. 

portulacoides from a heavy metal contaminated salt marsh and S. patens from a non-contaminated salt 

marsh to there are better suited for the upcoming environmental reality, being more warming tolerant 

than their counterparts. Therefore, in the heavy metal contaminated marsh in comparison to the non-

contaminated marsh, climate change appears to affect negatively the C4 invasive S. patens heat tolerance 

while increasing the performance of the C3 native H. portulacoides to warming events, which can 

dissuade the invasion trend showed by the S. patens, hence cross-tolerance favors the native species in 

the heavy metal contaminated environment. The same cannot be said in non-contaminated marsh, 

whereas climate change will promote the invasion of the exotic species.  

Thus, environmental pre-conditioning observed in this species can be considered to have an 

important influencing factor in how the plant tolerance mechanisms respond to abiotic changes, varying 

significantly in accordance with their environmental histories.

Abstract 

 
Land salinization is an increasing problem everywhere due to the excessive irrigation practices 

in agricultural production needed to supply the also increasing world population, however this 

phenomenon is predicted to be even higher in coastal regions. Water and soil salinity is predicted to 

increase thru the rising storm and tidal surges and sea level rising, currently millions of people live in 

low elevation costal-lands with risk of salinization. Nearly all plants are significantly damage or die 

when exposed to high salt concentration, on the other hand halophyte plants, typically encountered in 

salt marshes, are able to live and thrive in soil salinities up to 855mM.  Nevertheless, halophyte species 

experience between then a difference in their salt tolerance range and optimal salinity, this is a 

determined factor in the plant distribution through the marsh. Additionally, intraspecific variation to 

NaCl response is commonly observed in high raging halophyte species, possibly due to population 

conditioned by local abiotic factors that can influence the overall plant physiology, therefore the pre-

conditioning influence becomes meaningful to understand the evolution of salt marsh ecology through 

the expected consequences of climate change. In order to comprehend this implication this study aimed 

to understand if a different environmental condition will change the way salt marsh species react when 

exposed to a range of high salinities, analyzing the effects that salt stress as on the physiology and the 

photobiology. The results show that heavy metal pre-conditioning has a significant and complex role in 

changing the salt tolerance mechanism of C3-succulent Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4-

grass Spartina patens. Therefore, the pre-condition history of halophyte populations appears to have 

greatly influence their future distribution outcome. Whereas at a soil salinity of 400mM, the non-pre-

conditioned invasive individuals can display a disadvantage in the salt tolerance when compared to those 

belonging to the population from the heavy metal contaminated location and at 800mM NaCl both heavy 

metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides and S. patens appear to have a higher fitness when compared to 

the species their counterparts from the non-contaminated marsh. Thus, the contaminated salt marsh can 

be not only more less resilient to the S. patens colonization, but their halophyte species can be overall 

more salt tolerant due to their heavy metal pre-conditioning. 

 

Key words: Halimione portulacoides, Spartina patens, salinity stress, salt tolerance, local 

adaptation, intraspecific variability, Alcochete salt marsh, Rosário salt marsh.

Introduction 
 

According to the latest IPCC report, the analysis of the data gathered, through this and the last 

century, a worldwide intensification of abiotic stresses, such as the increase and intensity of extreme 

climate events, droughts, floods, sea level rising, water and land salinity variations are extremely likely 

with alarming environmental and economic implications (IPCC, 2014). Earth can be considered a salt 

planet since approximately, 97.5% of all planet’s water content is salt water, occupying roughly 70% of 

the surface encompassed in oceans, lake and groundwater (Shiklomanov, 2009), additionally, it has been 

estimated that high soil salinity is affecting 20% of total Earth’s land surface and 33% of agricultural 

irrigated lands (Glick et al., 2007, Shrivastava et al., 2014). Therefore, it can be presumed that soil and 

water salinity induced stress is and will be one of the major abiotic stresses. Usually, salt stress in plants 

is a powerful limiting production factor, upsetting every major crop development and productivity 

(Bacilio et al., 2004). Furthermore, most crops plants, generally, cannot grow in soils with NaCl 

concentrations higher than 40mM NaCl (Munns, 2005; Jamil et al., 2011). The constant increase in the 

world population results in higher food demand that leads to a more excessive irrigation practices to 

match the need for agricultural production hence contributing to the progressive land salinization. In 

coastal regions, especially in the high populated estuaries, climate change will likely increase, at an 

elevated rate, the soil and water salinity, mostly due to predicted storm surges, tidal surges and sea level 

rise causing an onward saltwater land inundation (Dasgupta and Hossain et al., 2015). Nowadays more 

than 600 million people live in considerable salinization risk areas, inhabiting low-elevation coastal 

lands (Wheeler, 2011). This presents a severe threat not only to coastal ecosystems but also to the 

agriculture, aquaculture and freshwater availability jeopardizing the sustainability of the growing human 

population (Flowers, 2004). Most of the crop plants when exposed to NaCl concentrations from 40 mM 

to 200 mM become severely damage or die, plants exposed to elevated salt concentrations result in 

several complex biochemical, physiological, and morphological damages, such as nutrient uptake and 

assimilation. (Munns and Tester, 2008; Akbarimoghaddam et al., 2011). On the other hand, and contrary 

to 99% of all the plant species, halophytic vegetation species can not only survive but be highly 

productive in saline environments. Halophytes are, by definition, plants that can live normally and 

complete their life cycle under a salt concentration of at least 200 mM, with most plants experiencing 

tolerance to a remarkable amplitude of NaCl concentration (Flowers and Colmer, 2008). However, it is 

known that different halophytes species have unlike responses to same salinity, ranging from species 

having optimal performance in salt-free environments to high NaCl concentration such as 400 mM 

(Flowers and Colmer, 2008; Duarte et al., 2014c). Intraspecies salt tolerance variations are relevant 

when taking into consideration the potential salinity environment modification due to climate change, 

that will most likely change salt tolerant plant habitat availability and distribution, within an ecosystem. 

This is evident in most halophytes populated salt marshes, where species distribution is organized and 

clearly observed within marsh topography and morphology, where plants are arranged according to soil 

elevation. Salinity tolerance is certainly related to plant zonation, salinity increases with soil elevation 

when, due to extended evaporation periods in higher elevation, however above mean high sea level 

(MHSL) salt concentration drops again, this time due to relative rare flooding (Adam, 2002; Caçador et 

al., 2007). Nonetheless, many studies suggest that intraspecific salt tolerance variations can occur in 

different populations (Hester et al., 1996; Flowers 2004). When intraspecific NaCl response is taken 

into consideration it may show a different response to same NaCl concentration, therefore it is important 

to understand coastal ecosystem modification and evolution once exposed to salinity changes. 

Tagus estuary wetland is considered one of the more important in Europe and encompasses the 

most extensive and continuous salt marsh area in Portugal, presenting a great concentration of organic 

matter and biological productivity. Salt marshes located within this estuary share most of the colonized 



 

47 

 

halophyte species, such as the C3 halophyte Halimione portulacoides (Chenopodiaceae) and the C4 

halophyte Spartina patens (Poaceae) and exhibit mostly similar abiotic conditions but, due to 

anthropogenic actions, there is also presence of significant difference in soil contaminants, notably 

industrial caused heavy metals pollution (Caçador et al., 1996). On account of climate change, it is 

predicted a variation of salinity concentrations and distribution in the estuary and a saltwater movement 

upstream due to sea level rising (Rodrigues et al., 2016). Salinity alterations in the environment will 

have a heavy impact all the Tagus estuary wetlands ecosystems certainly upsetting the development and 

distribution of the plant populations.  

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of heavy metal pre-conditioning in the 

physiological responses of two halophyte species to different saline environments. By means of 

imposing salinity treatments on two different heavy metal pre-conditioned populations of two widely 

spread halophyte species, it was possible to evaluate significant intraspecific variability in the 

physiological salt tolerance mechanisms. In view of the on-going climate change, it is relevant the 

knowledge of the differently conditioned salt marshes species potential to adapt and respond, directly 

related to future salt-induced habitat modifications, with respect to plant distribution and frequency.

Materials and methods 
 

Study Area and Sampling 

 

This study sampling was carried out as described in Chapter 2, section 2.1, and the samples used for 

salinity treatment were from the same group of samples gathered and grown for warming treatments 

explain in the second Chapter. 

 

 

Experimental setup 

 

In the lab, H. portulacoides and S. patens samples collected in Alcochete and Rosário salt marshes, 

after four-month adaptation and growth period, were separated into 3 groups with 5 replicates each 

(Table 3.1) and subjected to different salt concentration. The sample groups were placed in a fitoclimatic 

chamber programmed to simulate a natural light environment using a sin function (maximum PAR 300 

µmol photons m2 s-1, 16/8 h day/night rhythm, 20/18 ºC day/night temperature amplitude) and the 

hoagland nutrient solution was replaced, in two sample groups, with two salinity treatment solution of 

¼ Hoagland solution supplemented with NaCl in order to attain the desired salinities (400 and 800 mM). 

To detect salinity stress signs, the salinity treatment had a duration of 7 days after which the plants were 

harvested. All leave samples for biochemical measurements were immediately flash-frozen in liquid-N2 

and stored at -80ºC until analysis. Leaf samples harvested for fatty acid analysis were weighed before 

frozen.

H. portulacoides 
 

PS II quantum efficiency in H. portulacoides exposed to salinity treatment shown, regarding PS 

II operational quantum yield, a significant decrease in the non-contaminated site samples at 400mM 

NaCl and a highly significant decrease in the light-adapted leaves the other treated group samples (Fig. 

1). On the other hand, PS II maximum quantum yield showed no significant changes in non-

contaminated site population, contrasting with the decrease found in NaCl exposed contaminated 

location samples (Fig. 1). Regarding variable fluorescence in light (F’v; Fig. 1.) and dark (Fv; Fig. 1) 

adapted leaves it was shown decrease in all NaCl concentration groups, although this decrease was 

highly significant in light-adapted variable fluorescence at 800mM NaCl contaminated site samples and 

in dark-adapted variable fluorescence at 800mM NaCl non-contaminated and 400mM NaCl 

contaminated site samples and highly significant in dark-adapted variable fluorescence at 800mM NaCl 

in H. portulacoides from the contaminated location.

S. patens 

 
Salinity exposed S. patens PS II operational quantum yield results showed a decrease in the 

highest concentration of NaCl, being highly significant in non-contaminated site samples (Fig. 2). In 

both populations the PS II maximum quantum yield (Fig. 2) exhibited a decrease in all NaCl treated 

groups, the major difference was shown in 400mM NaCl treatments where non-contaminated site 

samples presented a significant decrease and samples from the contaminated location revealed a more 

accentuated, highly significant, decrease. Regarding variable fluorescence in light (F’v; Fig. 2) it was 

found a decrease through NaCl concentrations, being significant and highly significant at 800mM NaCl 

in the sample groups from the non-contaminated and contaminated locations respectively. Dark-adapted 

variable fluorescence in S. patens also showed, in both population, a decrease, with the difference of the 

reduction being significant in the 800Mm NaCl treated samples from the non-contaminated site and in 

both the NaCl treated contaminated site group samples.

Rapid light curves 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Concerning the rapid light gradient and its resulting parameters, in H. portulacoides there was 

an evident difference between populations response to salinity treatment. Photosynthetic efficiency (?), 

given by the initial slope of the electron transport rates (ETR), in non-contaminated site samples 

presented a significant increase in the 400 mM NaCl treatment samples and no significant changes in 

the group subjected to high salinity (800 mM). Contaminated site plants exposed to NaCl shown a visible 

increase in photosynthetic efficiency in both treatments, more in 400 mM salt concentration (Fig. 3). It 

is also of note, the acknowledgment that photosynthetic efficiency was different between population 

controls, visible in the 0 mM and 400 mM NaCl treatments where non-contaminated site samples ? 

values are, comparatively, higher. This coincides reversely with light saturation (Ek; Fig. 3) values 

shown by the different controls, higher in contaminated site 0 mM treated samples and significantly 

lower in the NaCl treated samples, whereas in samples from the non-contaminated location was found 

a significant decrease in the 400 mM NaCl exposed group. Maximum electron transport rates (ETRmax; 

Fig. 3) shown, in non-contaminated site samples, and significant increase 400 mM NaCl treated group 

and a visible reduction at 800 mM NaCl, nonetheless it was shown, in the contaminated site population, 

a visible tendency to decrease along the tested NaCl concentrations.

S. patens 

 
Salinity conditions in S. patens showed substantial differences in response by populations.  

Photosynthetic efficiency (?; Fig. 4), in non-contaminated site population, displayed no perceptible 

change in 400mM NaCl treatment and a non-significant increase at 800mM NaCl. On the other hand, 

the heavy metal pre-conditioned plants showed a significant increase when exposed to the 400mM NaCl 

nevertheless no meaningful change at 800 mM NaCl concentration. Maximum electron transport rates 

(ETRmax; Fig. 4) showed a significant decrease in S. patens from the non-contaminated location at 

400mM NaCl concentration and in contaminated site S. patens at 800 mM NaCl. In light saturation (Ek; 

Fig. 4) it was detected a tendency to decrease the visible tendency to decrease through higher salinity 

treatments.

Kautsky curves and OJIP-test 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Observing Kautsky plots, obtain from chlorophyll fast-induction curves, from H. portulacoides 

samples submitted to salinity treatments (Fig. 5), it exhibited an evident decrease of the fluorescence 

values through the increasing NaCl concentration treatments. For fluorescence at 300 ms peak amplitude 

(WK; Fig. 5), there was a perceptible increase at 400 mM NaCl exposed samples to a decrease at 800 



 

54 

 

mM NaCl in both populations. However, the active oxygen-evolving complexes (Active OECs; Fig. 5), 

showed a decrease at 400 mM NaCl and an increase at 800 mM NaCl, when compared to the 0 mM

differences between treatments at *P&lt;0,05; **P&lt;0,01). 

 

Regarding H. portulacoides leaf chloroplasts energy fluxes, it was evident a significant 

reduction throughout higher NaCl concentration treatments, more so in non-contaminated site treated 

samples, in trapped energy flux (TR/CS; Fig. 6), electron transport energy flux (ET/CS; Fig. 6), reaction 

centers available for reduction (RC/CS; Fig. 6) and oxidized quinone pool size (Fig.7). Nevertheless, 

the reduction tendency happened with different value significances, being more evident in the 

individuals originated from the non-contaminated site. The reduction observed in the oxidized quinone 

pool size only exhibited a significant reduction in 800 mM NaCl treated non-contaminated samples. 

Absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS; Fig. 6) showed a non-significant decrease tendency throughout higher 

NaCl concentration treatments in the non-contaminated site population, nonetheless, the heavy metal 

pre-conditioned H. portulacoides population showed an increase at 400 mM NaCl and a decrease at 800 

mM NaCl, both non-significant. Dissipated energy flux (DI/CS; Fig. 6) changed similarly in both 

population, it presented a non-significant increase in the two salt treatments although more markedly in 

400 mM NaCl treated samples.

differences between treatments at *P&lt;0,05; **P&lt;0,01). 

 

Regarding the total number of electrons transferred into the electron transport chain (N; Fig. 7), 

the contaminated site samples exhibited an increase trend displaying a significant increase in the 800 

mM NaCl treatment, on the other hand, non-contaminated population when exposed to salinity stress 

showed no significant changes, only presenting an unsubstantial rise and decrease in the individuals 

exposed to 400 and the 800 mM NaCl respectively. The net rate of PS II reaction centers closure (M0; 

Fig 7) shown a decreasing trend in H. portulacoides from the non-contaminated location and, in contrast, 

the contaminated site population displayed an increasing trend throughout salt treatments 

concentrations, nonetheless, the changes were not significant. Considering the PS II antennae 

connectivity through grouping probability (PG; Fig 7), the population from the heavy metal contaminated 

location showed a decrease throughout NaCl exposure levels with a significant decrease in the 800 mM 

NaCl treated samples, however in the non-contaminated site H. portulacoides population a significant 



 

56 

 

decrease was observed only in the 400 mM NaCl treated samples. Furthermore, the electron movement 

efficiency from the reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the PS I end electron movement (?R0; Fig. 

7), was found to display a decrease tendency throughout the salinity treatment in non-contaminated site 

samples. On the other hand, a significant increase tendency was observed in the plants from the heavy 

metal contaminated location throughout NaCl treatments.

S. patens 
 

Observing S. patens Kautsky curves it was shown an evident decrease of the fluorescence values 

that accompanied the increasing NaCl concentration treatments in both populations, nevertheless the 

non-contaminated site population had a meaningfully higher fluorescence curve values. Within-



 

57 

 

populations, the active oxygen-evolving complexes (Active OECs; Fig. 8) did not change with salinity 

exposure, nevertheless, the active OECs values were higher in the contaminated site population. The K-

step peak amplitude (WK; Fig. 8) showed apparent differences between populations. The non-

contaminated location samples exposed to 400 mM NaCl, displayed lower WK values, however in heavy 

metal contaminated site individuals showed higher WK.

Energetic fluxes of the salt treated S. patents chloroplasts, when compared to 0mM exposed 

individuals, showed similar significant reduction in trapped energy flux (TR/CS; Fig. 9) in both 

treatments although this decrease was not significant in the pre-conditioned individuals at 800 mM 

NaCl, possibly due to the comparatively lower value exhibited by the individuals exposed to 0 mM 

NaCl. Absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS; Fig. 9) displayed a reduction in both population when salt 

treated, significant in contaminated site samples at 400 mM NaCl. Electron transport energy flux 

(ET/CS; Fig. 9) showed a significant reduction on both NaCl treated individuals from the non-

contaminated and contaminated site. In response to salt exposure significant decreases were detected in 

the treatments of both population regarding the density of oxidized reaction centers (RC/CS; Fig. 9). 

Dissipation energy flux (DI/CS; Fig. 9) showed unlike responses to salinity in the different salt marsh 

S. patens populations. Plants from the non-contaminated site exposed to 400 mM NaCl showed higher 

energy dissipation whilst the individuals exposed to 800 mM NaCl exhibited a decrease in this same 

parameter. In pre-conditioned individuals, the NaCl-treated samples exhibited a reduction in dissipation, 

more evident in the samples exposed to 400mM NaCl concentration, these changes were not significant.

contaminated site, exposed to a salinity gradient (average ± standard error, N=5; asterisks mark significant differences between 

treatments at *P&lt;0,05; **P&lt;0,01). 

 

When compared to the 0mM treated samples, the oxidized quinone pool size showed a 

significant decrease in both 400 and 800mM salt treatments of the contaminated site S. patens, however, 

the same was not observable in the non-contaminated location samples where a non-significant decrease 

was visible in the 400 mM NaCl-exposed samples. On the other hand, the individuals exposed to 800 

mM NaCl showed a non-significant increase of the oxidized quinone pool size (Fig. 10). Considering 

total number of electrons transferred into the electron transport chain (N; Fig. 10), the non-contaminated 

site population showed an increasing trend, displaying a significant increase in 400 mM NaCl exposed 

group and a highly significant increase in 800 mM NaCl treatment. The changes this parameter values 

in the contaminated location samples exhibited a decrease in the 400 mM NaCl treated samples and an 

increase in 800 mM NaCl exposed samples. Regarding the net rate of PS II reaction centers closure (M0; 

Fig. 10), a significant increase was evident in the 400 mM salt treatments of both populations. 



 

59 

 

Considering the grouping probability (PG; Fig. 10), it was exhibited a significant decrease in PS II 

antennae connectivity in both salt treatments of the heavy metal pre-conditioned population, on the other 

hand, the 400 Mm NaCl treated non-contaminated site samples showed no substantial change while 800 

mM NaCl treated non-contaminated location samples showed a highly significant increase.  

Additionally, the electron movement efficiency from the reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the 

PS I end electron movement (?R0; Fig. 10), at 400 mM NaCl, showed an increase S. paten from the non-

contaminated and a decrease in pre-conditioned individuals. Regarding the 800mM NaCl treated 

samples, both populations displayed an increase in this variable, being this highly significant in the non-

contaminated site samples, when compared to the samples grown in the absence of NaCl.

Leaf pigment composition 

 

H. portulacoides 
 

Regarding the response to salinity in leaf pigments concentration in H. portulacoides, when 

compared to 0mM NaCl treated individuals, evident differences were found in both salt marsh 

populations. While no substantial changes in chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and total 

chlorophyll (Total Chl) concentrations were found in non-contaminated site population, in contaminated 

marsh H. portulacoides it was shown a highly significant tendency of reduction of these pigments 

through salinity treatments (Fig. 11). Regarding individual carotenoid concentrations, the same response 

to NaCl exposure was found, with the exception of zeaxanthin. On the other hand, it was found some 

differences in pigment concentration between population samples, with the contaminated site population 

presenting, in general rule, higher carotenoid concentration (Fig. 11). Similar highly significant 

concentration increase tendency was displayed in antheraxanthin, ?-carotene and lutein. Pigment 

concentration of auroxanthin of the individuals from the two sites, exhibited a significant increase in 

both high salinity treatments. Neoxanthin and violaxanthin, in both the salt marsh individuals, displayed 

an increase and a decrease in the 400 mM and 800 mM NaCl treatments, respectively. In H. 

portulacoides from the non-contaminated location, 400 mM NaCl exposure leaded to a decrease in 

zeaxanthin content, although in the heavy metal contaminated site samples it was observed a highly 

significant decrease in both NaCl treatments. All NaCl exposed sample groups showed an increase in 

chlorophyll a/b ratio (Fig. 12), significant in non-contaminated site samples. Total carotenoid to total 

chlorophyll ratio (Fig. 12) showed an increasing trend in all treatments, with a significant increase at 

400 mM NaCl and a highly significant increase at 800 mM NaCl. A similar trend was observed in 

chlorophyll degradation index, with a significant rise in 400 mM NaCl contaminated site samples and 

highly significant increase in both populations 800 mM NaCl treatments. This increase in the 

chlorophyll degradation index in 400 mM NaCl exposed samples from the non-contaminated location 

was not significant, possibly due to the 0 mM NaCl values differences between populations. As for the 

de-epoxidation state (DES; Fig. 12) index, a highly significant increase was evident in all salinity 

exposed sample groups, being slightly higher in the heavy metal pre-conditioned sample group.

S. patens 
 

Considering the leaf pigments concentration results, significant differences were observed 

between the salinity exposed S. patens individuals from both populations, when compared to the samples 

exposed to the 0mM salinity treatment. It was found a significant increase in chlorophyll a (Chl a; Fig. 

13) concentrations of non-contaminated location individuals exposed to 400 mM NaCl. On the other 

hand, in pre-conditioned S. patens individuals, a significant increase was found in under 800 mM NaCl 

exposure. Chlorophyll b (Chl b; Fig. 13) showed no variation in concentration in heavy metal pre-

conditioned individuals exposed to salinity, yet non-contaminated site NaCl exposed samples presented 

an increasing trend in chlorophyll b concentration, significant at 400 mM NaCl and highly significant 

at 800 mM NaCl. Chlorophyll content variation between populations led to different total chlorophyll 

(Total Chl) and chlorophyll a/b ratio values between S. patens salinity responses. Considering total 

chlorophyll concentration changes, it was only observed a significant increase in non-contaminated and 

contaminated site sample group exposed to 400 mM NaCl and 800 mM NaCl treatments respectively. 

Chlorophyll a/b ratio presented, in non-contaminated site samples, a significant increase under 400 mM 

NaCl exposure and a highly significant decrease in the individuals subjected to 800 mM NaCl. However, 

pre-conditioned samples presented a significant ratio increase in the 400mM NaCl treatment (Fig. 14). 

Regarding carotenoid concentration, major differences were found between S. patens responses to salt 

exposure (Fig. 13). Lutein showed a highly significant increase in non-contaminated site samples at 



 

63 

 

800mM NaCl. In S. patens from the non-contaminated location it was observed an increasing trend in 

neoxanthin concentration, significant at 400 mM NaCl and highly significant at 800 mM NaCl. On the 

other hand, in pre-conditioned samples a highly significant decrease was detected in 800 mM NaCl 

treatment. Additionally, violaxanthin in the non-contaminated location samples presented an increasing 

trend in concentration, significant and highly significant at 400mM and 800mM NaCl respectively, 

however contaminated site population showed a highly significant increase when exposed to 800mM 

NaCl. Regarding chlorophyll degradation index (Fig. 14), only pre-conditioned individuals exposed to 

800 mM NaCl showed a highly significant increase. De-epoxidation state (DES) index results shown 

similar responses between the tested groups.

Anti-oxidant enzymes 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Regarding the activity of H. portulacoides anti-oxidant enzymes, some variations were found 

in the individuals subjected to NaCl. Salt exposed plants shown similar highly significant increases in 

catalase (CAT; Fig. 15) activity along the tested salinity gradient and comparatively higher in non-

contaminated location samples. Ascorbate peroxidase (APx) activity (Fig. 15) showed enhanced activity 

in non-contaminated site samples at 800 mM NaCl and in 400 and 800 mM NaCl pre-conditioned 

individuals, in comparison to 0mM NaCl treated samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (Fig. 

15) showed a highly significant increase exclusively in non-contaminated site at 800mM NaCl. Guaiacol 

peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity (Fig. 15), presented a highly significant decrease in all salinity 

exposed groups. Considering, total protein content (Fig. 15), it was observed decreasing trends in both 

population through salt exposure, being highly significant non-contaminated site samples at 800 mM 

NaCl. As for membrane lipid peroxidation content (MDA; Fig. 15), a significant decrease in the leaves 

of 400 mM treated H. portulacoides individuals was detected in both populations, while no significant 

changes were observed at 800mM NaCl.

S. patens 
 

Salt exposed S. patens populations exhibited substantial differences in anti-oxidant enzyme 

patterns of activity (Fig. 16). Although catalase (Fig. 16) activity presented a highly significantly 

increase in all salt concentration, the CAT values were considerably higher in plants from the non-

contaminated marsh. Ascorbate peroxidase activity did not show significant variations, nevertheless a 

higher APx activity in non-contaminated site samples at 0 mM and 800mM NaCl, could be observed. 

Guaiacol peroxidase enzyme activity (Fig. 16), presented, in the salinity tested groups, no meaningful 



 

66 

 

change in the non-contaminated site population. On the other hand, pre-conditioned S. patens 

individuals shown a significant activity decrease through NaCl concentration gradient. Superoxide 

dismutase activity (Fig. 16) showed an increase in non-pre-conditioned samples exposed to NaCl, being 

this significant at 800mM NaCl, whereas no significant changes were observable in the pre-conditioned 

groups. Regarding the total protein content of the leaves, a decreased tendency was observed in the non-

contaminated site samples, most significant at 800 mM NaCl. Still in pre-conditioned S. patens salt 

exposed groups a non-significant increasing tendency was detected. Considering leaf MDA 

concentration, a significant increase was observed in S. patens from both locations when exposed to 800 

mM NaCl (Fig. 16).

Fatty acid composition 

 

H. portulacoides 

 
Response to 400 mM and 800 mM salinity treatments, when compared to the 0mM treated 

individuals, showed a significant difference in the fatty acid profile between H. portulacoides 

populations (Fig. 17). Myristic acid (C14:0) and pentadecylic acid (C15:0) only showed considerably 

lower values in non-pre-conditioned 800 mM NaCl treated samples. Palmitic acid (C16:0) showed a 

significant increase in content in 400 and 800mM NaCl sample groups. Trans-delta 3-hexadecenoic acid 

(C16:1t) exhibited a highly significant decrease in the plants from non-contaminated site treated at 400 

and 800 mM NaCl, in turn pre-conditioned individuals showed a highly significant at 800mM NaCl. No 

major changes were observed in stearic acid (C18:0) excepted in the contaminated site samples at 

800mM showed a significant rise. A similar significant increase was found in oleic acid relative content 

(C18:1) in both populations, higher under 400 mM NaCl exposure. Linoleic acid (C18:2; omega-6 

category) showed a highly significant increase in the non-contaminated marsh individuals exposed to 

800 mM NaCl and a significant decrease in pre-conditioned individuals exposed to 400 mM NaCl. 

Linolenic acid (C18:3; omega-3 category) presented a decrease in all NaCl-treated plants, being this 

significant in pre-conditioned H. portulacoides individuals. The most abundant fatty acids found were 

palmitic, linoleic and linolenic acid, although upon salinity exposure, oleic acid became relevant as well. 

Regarding the saturation classes profile (Fig. 17), it was found a significant increase of saturated fatty 

acid content in all treatments. Monounsaturated fatty acids showed similar significant increases in 

response to all salinity concentrations tested. On the other hand, polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a 

highly significant decrease in all salinity exposed groups except in the contaminated site samples at 

400mM NaCl, yet a non-significant decrease is observed.

Halimione portulacoides total fatty acid content showed significant increase in all high NaCl 

treated individuals (Fig. 18). Concerning the linoleic acid to linolenic acid ratio (C18:2/C18:3; Fig. 18), 

when comparing to the values acquired at 0mM NaCl, it was found highly significant increase in 800mM 

NaCl exposed plants of both populations. The double bound index (DBI; Fig. 18) showed a significant 

decrease in both populations exposed to 400mM and 800mM salinity treatments.

69 

 

 

S. patens 

 
Regarding S. patens fatty acid leaf content under salinity exposure (Fig. 19), there were found 

some disparities between the plant populations. The most abundant fatty acids found in the tested groups 

were palmitic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. When compared to the individuals at 0 mM, the 

salinity stressed leaves showed an increase in palmitic acid in the individuals originated from the non-

contaminated marsh, highly significant at 800mM NaCl. However, pre-conditioned plants revealed a 

decrease in this fatty acid content. Stearic acid displayed an increase in pre-conditioned individuals 

while the plants from non-contaminated marshes showed the opposite trend. C16:1t Both populations 

displayed a linolenic acid content decrease more significant in the pre-conditioned individuals exposed 

to 800 mM NaCl. It is noteworthy, the palmitic acid and stearic acid considerable differences in both S. 

patens group samples at 0 mM NaCl, with pre-conditioned samples showing a much higher content of 

this fatty acid. Considering fatty acid saturation classes in salt treated S. patens leaves (Fig. 19), no 

significant changes were detected in saturated fatty acids abundance, with the exception of a significant 

increase in pre-conditioned individuals exposed to 800 mM NaCl. Monounsaturated fatty acids showed 

a rise in content in all treatments, significant in pre-conditioned S. patens plants subjected to 400 mM 

and 800 mM NaCl. On the contrary, polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a decrease in all populations 

treatments, particularly evident in 800 mM NaCl exposed plants.

Like in H. portulacoides, the total fatty acid content of S. patens presents highly significantly 

increases in all population treatments, with the difference between populations (Fig 20). The

C18:2/C18:3 ratio showed a significant increase in pre-conditioned NaCl exposed plants. As for the 

double bound index (DBI; Fig 20), this same population showed an inverse trend.

Discussion 

 
Effects of environmental change on coastal regions include the progressive land immersion from 

ocean level rise, heightened storm damage, expanding drought seasons and temperature increase. This 

environmental abiotic alteration has consequences in the salinity gradient, with recent studies 

forecasting disturbing impacts of salinity disturbance in waterfront areas (Wheeler, 2011; Dasgupta et 

al., 2015). Thus, halophyte plant colonization will be of foremost importance to future environmental 

change. 

Photochemical analysis of the Halimione portulacoides and Spartina patens samples exposed 

to salt treatments confirmed that these species have a high degree of tolerance to salinity even at high 

NaCl concentrations. Nevertheless, it was shown an apparent variation of the consequences and 

responses to different NaCl concentrations between individuals from different populations. Examining 

the PS II light harvesting mechanism in H. portulacoides and S. patens it is evident the that both 

halophyte species are well adapted to salt environments. Halimione portulacoides at 400 mM NaCl 

showed an increase in the photosynthetic efficiency (?) when compared to the individuals at 0 mM 

NaCl. This data is in accordance with other studies (e.g. Duarte et al., 2014) that reveal the better 

performance of H. portulacoides at approximately these salt concentrations. However, the 

photosynthetic efficiency presented a significant increase in the individuals from the non-contaminated 

marsh and coupled with the significant raise of the maximum ETR seen in the same sample group 

suggests a better overall light harvesting efficiency to 400 mM NaCl enrich environments than the 

individuals from the heavy metal contaminated marsh. Additionally, the comparatively low value of 

photosynthetic efficiency found in the 0 mM NaCl treated pre-conditioned samples may suggest that 

non-contaminated site H. portulacoides have better fitness under brackish conditions as well. Even 

though it can be considered that H. portulacoides is an obligatory halophyte, negative impacts, due to 

salinity stress, were found in the decrease of the active OECs and the increase of the K-step amplitude 

in the 400 mM salt treatment samples, the relationship of this parameters indicates a specific damage to 

the oxygen evolving complex of PS II donor side (Duarte et al., 2016b). Considering the Kautsky curves, 

salinity stress harmful consequences are also shown by the fluorescence decrease tendency throughout 

the increasing salt concentration treatments, directly related to the decrease tendency detected in the 

oxidized quinone pool size, when related with the PS II acceptor side (Strasser et al., 1995). 

Additionally, it was observed variations between the curves displayed by the different H. portulacoides 

population samples within same salt treatment, O-J step of the non-contaminated site samples indicate 

a greater damage to the photochemical energy production in the chloroplasts from both salinity 

treatments, on the other hand pre-conditioned individuals at 400 mM NaCl showed a lesser efficiency 

in the dissipation of the excessive energy throughout thermal dissipation than its counterpart, as shown 

in the J-I-P step, this can have photo-inhibition consequences in the individuals from the heavy metal 

contaminated marsh due to the fact that this characterizes an important ROS reducing mechanism 

(Duarte et al. 2014c). This assessment is confirmed in the analyzed phenomological energetic parameter, 

where a decrease tendency of the trapped energy flux (TR/CS), the electron transport energy flux 

(ET/CS) and the number of available reaction centers for reduction (RC/CS) was present throughout the 

salinities treatments with more intensity and with bigger significance in non-contaminated site samples. 

Although the quinone poll available for reduction was diminished, the RC turnover rate increase 

especially in pre-conditioned H. portulacoides individuals exposed to higher salinities, indicating lower 

quinone reduction rates (Duarte et al., 2016b). Pre-conditioned individuals presented an increase in net 

rate of PS II reactive centres as a counteractive measure, allowing higher energy fluxes than the non-

pre-conditioned individuals as previously seen (Panda et al., 2006; Kalaji et al., 2011). The PS I ?R0 

presented a significantly improved activity through the salt stressed individuals from the contaminated 



 

72 

 

marsh, indicating a tolerance mechanism to prevent accumulation of reduction power at the PS I acceptor 

side, in order to maintain the redox equilibrium between photosystems (Krüger et al., 2014; Duarte et 

al., 2016b), on the other hand this mechanism has not present in the non-pre-conditioned samples. 

Nevertheless, when compared to the individuals from the non-contaminated marsh the pre-conditioned 

H. portulacoides displayed greater signs of PS II antennae connectivity disruption, as shown by PG, 

especially when exposed to 800 mM NaCl, impairing the energetic transport (Strasser and Strirbet, 

2001). The loss of connectivity between PS II antennae can be a major reason for the comparatively 

lower photosynthetic efficiency and J-I-P step observed in the pre-conditioned individuals at 400 mM 

NaCl, as a result of the inhibition of the ETC (Zushi et al., 2012). According to the PAM fluorometry 

data, it can be argued that the H. portulacoides from the non-contaminated location had a better 

performance when exposed to 400 mM NaCl conditions, on the other hand, at 800 mM NaCl, the heavy 

metal pre-contained individuals presented a slightly better biophysical feedback. 

 Considering the electron transport chain and related parameters in salt treated S. patens, when 

compared to 0 mM NaCl, it was observed a significant raise in overall photosynthetic light efficiency in 

pre-conditioned individuals at 400mM NaCl as well as significant decrease in maximum ETR at 400mM 

and 800mM NaCl in non-contaminated and contaminated site samples respectively. This may suggest a 

worse electron transport chain proficiency in S. patens from the heavy metal contaminated location when 

expose to 800mM NaCl concentrations, in contrast to a better performance in S. patens from the non-

contaminated site when exposed to that same high salinity. The pre-contaminated individuals that 

showed an increase in the photosynthetic efficiency at 400 mM NaCl also displayed a relatively low 

dissipation energy, suggesting a higher efficiency in the electronic transport chain. Observing the 

Kautsky curves in S. patens, exposure to salinity clearly affected the fluorescence values, presenting, in 

individuals subjected to high salinities, a depressed and homogenous profile with less distinguishable 

peaks, characteristic of stressed plants. Nevertheless, the active OECs and the K-step amplitude 

remained the same, with no significant changes, within marsh sample groups, yet the relationship 

between this Kautsky curve derived parameters, when comparing the non-pre-conditioned and pre-

conditioned salinity treated samples, can indicate a better PS II function in the heavy metal pre-

conditioned S. patens. The loss of the area above the transient curve is directly associated to the size of 

the oxidized quinone pool (Strasser et al., 1995), that in turn will greatly influence the phenomological 

energetic parameters (Kalaji et al., 2011). According to the data acquired, in the salt exposed samples 

groups, there is a linear relationship between the variation found in the oxidized quinone pool size the 

electron transport energy flux, the absorbed energy flux (ABS/CS), the trapped energy flux, as well as 

the available reaction centers, nonetheless, the population showed differences in significance among 

these values. Even though the pre-conditioned S. patens at 400 and 800 mM NaCl, when compared to 

the samples at 0 mM NaCl, showed a more significant decrease in quinone pool size, yet the reduction 

in the electron transport energy flux was less significant than the one displayed in the individuals from 

the non-contaminated site, this can be explain by the better PS II efficiency associated with the lower 

dissipation energy flux found in the pre-conditioned individuals (Kalaji et al., 2011). Although the 

quinone pool size, in the individuals from the non-contaminated location subjected to salinity stress, 

displayed no significant changes in the number of quinones, the number of quinone turnovers increased, 

showing lower quinone pool reduction rates (Duarte et al., 2016b), in contrast the individuals from the 

contaminated marsh exhibited a significant reduction of the quinone pool size and no significant changes 

in its turnover time, indicating tolerance mechanisms that allowed the maintenance of electronic flow 

rate from the reduced quinone pool to the electron transport chain ( Duarte et al., 2014c).  

Xanthophyll cycle is a well-described mechanism of energy dissipation, commonly observed in 

halophytic plants (Duarte et al, 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, 2016b). To reduce energy overload within light-

harvesting complexes (LHCs), the de-epoxidation of the violaxanthin pool towards the zeaxanthin is 

normally activated (Wentworth et al., 2000). Both H. portulacoides populations shown the presence of 



 

73 

 

xanthophyll cycle, demonstrated by the highly significant raises in de-epoxidation when salt treated in 

comparison to the samples at 0 mM NaCl. Halimione portulacoides also showed increase tendency in 

the total carotenoid to total chlorophyll ratio, indicating a plant activity shift from light harvesting to 

photoprotection (Wentworth et al., 2000). Both high salinity treated samples from both location shown 

a significant increase in auroxanthin, an analog of violaxanthin, a C5,8 carotenoid with an aggregation 

-associated querying capacity (Ruban et al., 1998), when compared to the 0 mM NaCl treated groups. 

This pigment energy dissipation capacity relies on the fact that the auroxanthin first energy stage is 

higher than that of the violaxanthin (Wentworth et al., 2000), an efficient energy quencher when the 

plant is stressed (Ruban et al., 1998). Nonetheless, H. portulacoides from the non-contaminated site 

presents a higher significance in the increase of this pigment at 400 mM NaCl then its counterpart, 

suggesting a better energy dissipation mechanism in the non-pre-conditioned samples at 400 mM NaCl, 

corroborating the inferences made when observing their Kautsky curves, that suggested that heavy metal 

pre-conditioned samples displayed a lesser energy dissipation efficiency. Moreover, chlorophyll 

degradation index increased highly significantly within the high concentration salt treatments except in 

the non-pre-condition individual at 400 mM NaCl, pointing to a better light harvesting stress response. 

Considering S. patens exposed to salinity, only in 800 mM NaCl treatments in both population samples, 

showed a highly significant increase in de-epoxidation, reflection of a higher activity of the xanthophyll 

cycle attempting to scatter the excessive redox potential amassed inside the stroma. The activity shift to 

photoprotection in the higher salinities was also clear due to the significant rise of total carotenoid to 

total chlorophyll ratio. As a possible countermeasure against reactive oxygen species (ROS; Duarte et 

al., 2013a) highly significant rises were observed in ?-carotene and lutein, anti-oxidant acting, pigment 

concentrations in both H. portulacoides salt exposed populations. In S. patens, this countermeasure was 

found more significant in the population from the non-contaminated marsh, as a highly significant 

increase in ?-carotene was found in the contaminated site samples at 800mM NaCl and at both high 

salinity concentration in the plants from the non-contaminated location, as well as a highly significant 

increase in lutein at 800 mM NaCl. This may indicate a better ROS savaging response by pre-

conditioned S. patens. 

The interaction of high NaCl concentrations with the cell organelles leads to an increase 

production ROS resulting in potentially harmful physiological reactions within the plant cells, affecting 

among others, proteins production and metabolism (Duarte et al., 2013b). Halophytes built up a highly 

proficient system of enzymatic rapid responses toward salinity changes, immediately activated when the 

environmental conditions shift aside from the saline comfort zone (Zhou et al., 2014). When observing 

the salt treated H. portulacoides populations, it showed similar responses in the second line of ROS 

defense between them, displaying comparable value changes in the peroxidase-class enzymes, such as, 

catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPx), and ascorbate peroxidase, that are fundamental for the 

detoxification of the hydrogen peroxide and key in the reduction of ROS to non-damaging 

concentrations (Duarte et al., 2014c). However, at the first line of defense, superoxide dismutase (SOD), 

which catalyzes the conversion of the highly toxic superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide (Duarte et 

al., 2014c), exhibited a highly significant increase in in the 800 mM NaCl treated individuals from the 

non-contaminated marsh. This coupled with the highly significant decrease of the total protein content 

found in this same group, subjects that, when exposed to 800 mM NaCl, the non-preconditioned H. 

portulacoides had a higher ROS production than the pre-conditioned H. portulacoides, indicating lower 

resistance to high Na+ interaction. Scavenging mechanisms of ROS species were highly efficient at 400 

mM NaCl due to the lowering of the lipid peroxidation levels in comparison to the individuals at 0 mM 

NaCl, this was acquired from the analysis of the leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, a direct 

product oxidative degradation of membrane lipids (Neto et al., 2005), this indicates and is in accordance 

with the knowledge that H. portulacoides is better adapted to a 400mM NaCl setting than no salt 

environment. However, the MDA decrease present in both 400mM NaCl treatments was more 



 

74 

 

significant in the non-contaminated site individuals and consequently can be considered healthier and 

more salt tolerant in comparison to their H. portulacoides counterpart, possibly due to the better energy 

dissipation mechanism seen previously in the plants from the non-contaminated marsh. When 

comparing the oxidative stress biomarkers in S. patens, variances between populations are clear. 

Contrary to what was found in the pre-conditioned S. patens, the non-contaminated site individuals 

displayed an increase of superoxide dismutase and a decrease in total protein content through NaCl 

treatments, suggesting an inferior scavenging mechanism of the ROS species. This is especially felt in 

the non-pre-conditioned S. patens at 800 mM NaCl due to higher lipid peroxidation levels, seen thru the 

highly significant increase of the MDA concentration. 

The fatty acid profiles of the salt exposed halophytes presented similar responses amongst 

populations, but some differences were found. The linoleic (C18:2) and linolenic (C18:3) ratios can be 

a salt stress indication, when under stress condition the ratio shifts towards linolenic, since it is a 

membrane restructuring with lower amounts of polyunsaturated acids, thus inferior C18:3 concentration 

in the leaf is considered an adaptation to salt exposure (Hamed et al. 2005). The C18:2/ C18:3 ratio 

increased exclusively through the NaCl treatments in the heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens, 

therefore tis can suggest that these individuals are less salinity stressed than those from the non-

contaminated location. Furthermore, C18:3 can also act as a direct non-enzymatic reactive oxygen 

species (ROS) scavenger (Mene-Saffrane et al. 2009), which complies with the, comparatively, lower 

ROS consequences found previously in the pre-conditioned S. patens. Furthermore, pre-conditioned S. 

patens displayed highly significant rise in oleic acid (C18:1), known for improving the stabilization of 

light-harvesting complexes (Siefermann-Harms and Angerhofer, 1998), as seen by the positive 

significant correlation between LHC stress indictor chl a/ chl b ration and the C18:1 fatty acid significant 

correlation (r2 = 0,921; P&lt;0,05), on the other hand in the individuals from the non-contaminated site the 

correlation between this two variables is quite low (r2 = 0,161; P&lt;0,05), indicating that this mechanism 

only occur in the plants from the heavy metal contaminated marsh. Regarding the palmitic acid (C16:0), 

that plays a vital role in the PS II functioning (Duarte et al., 2016b), in H. portulacoides the highly 

significant increases, when compared to individuals at 0 mM NaCl, where found in the non-pre-

conditioned individuals at 400 mM NaCl and in pre-conditioned individuals at 800 mM NaCl, indicating 

a better PS II functioning in these sample groups than their counterparts, supporting the inferences made 

when analyzing the H. portulacoides PAM fluorometry data. Tras-delta-3 hexadecenoic acid (C16:1t), 

exclusive to plastids (Trémolières and Siegenthaler, 1983) and the only strictly light dependent fatty 

acid, enables the correct organization of light-harvesting antennae complexes (Nussberger et al., 1993; 

Hobe et al., 1994; ‚ Hobe et al., 1995; Duarte et al., 2016). In S. patens, when compared to the 

individuals at 0 mM NaCl, a significant increasing trend was found in the C16:1t concentration of the 

individuals from the contaminated marsh, concomitant with the, previously determined, lower energy 

dissipation and reduced reaction centres turnover and closure rates found in the pre-conditioned samples, 

comparatively to those found in the individuals from the non-contaminated marsh, proposing a better 

LHC organization and heath in the heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens when exposed to salt stress.

Conclusions  
 

The invasion of exotic species to new environments are regulated by numerous abiotic 

restrictions (Daehler and Strong, 1996), the same is applied to the distribution and survival of the native 

species when the forecasted climate change phenomenon alters the ecosystem abiotic settings. Salt 

marshes ecosystems are characterized for being high salinity ecosystems, where only halophytes, salt 

tolerant plants are able to endure, on the other hand, species have different salinity tolerances, 

consequently salinity concentration is one of the major constraints of species frequency, distribution and 

zonation (Silvestri et al., 2004; Duarte et al., 2014c).  

This study showed that both C3 Halimione portulacoides and the invasive C4 Spartina patens 

are extremely tolerant to high concentration salinity changes, even being able to adapt to an environment 

roughly twice as saline as the ocean. Nonetheless, our findings showed that environmental heavy metal 

pre-conditioning have a considerable influence on the salinity tolerance mechanisms and salinity 

resistance of these plants. The halophyte species displayed noteworthy intraspecific biophysical and 

biochemical variations when exposed to salty stress, due to the significantly different pre-conditioning 

history between populations. According to the data gathered and in agreement to previous studies, H. 

portulacoides exposed to 400 mM NaCl appear to have a better photosynthetic efficiency, however, 

even though H. portulacoides from the contaminated marsh displayed better photochemical energy 

production, as seen in the O-J step and the energy fluxes, the non-pre-conditioned plants at 400 mM 

NaCl displayed an overall better performance at this salinity mostly due to a better ability to dissipate 

energy seen in the J-I-P step, this is supported by the reduced ROS damage and the better energy 

dissipation mechanism, apparent in the more significant auroxanthin increase that suggests a more 

efficient energy dissipation mechanism. On the other hand, 800 mM NaCl treated H. portulacoides from 

the non-contaminated location exhibited an overall inferior response to this high salinity concentration. 

Heavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides at 800 mM NaCl showed an seemingly more efficient 

salt tolerance, demonstrated in the lesser damages in photochemical energy production, showing a 

comparatively better photon entrapment and energy transferred in the transport chain, clearly seen in the 

variances between the phenomological energetic parameters of both populations as well as increasing 

in palmitic acid that acted as a countermeasure to the salinity stress, ensuring the PS II functioning. 

Regarding the variances found in the stress responses in the salinity exposed S. patens populations, it 

was apparent that the heavy metal contaminated marsh population exhibited lesser damages due to 

comparatively more efficient salt tolerance mechanisms. Pre-conditioned individuals appear to have 

significantly more effective biochemical responses that the individuals from the non-contaminated site, 

that appear to withstand harshest photochemical consequences as seen by the decrease throughout higher 

salt concentrations of the chlorophyll a/b ratio, contrarily to the increase tendency found in the pre-

conditioned. This correlating with the highly significant increase in oleic acid found only in pre-

conditioned S. patens, indicates that the plants from this population have an effective light-harvesting 

complexes stabilization mechanism, on the other hand, non-pre-conditioned appear to display 

impairments in the LHC mechanisms, that coupled with the comparatively deficient energy dissipation 

mechanisms, seems to lead to higher ROS generation and as consequence greater plant damage.  

Rendering the latest IPCC report, the variation in salinity concentration will intensify and will 

have highly detrimental consequences on the world’s coastal ecosystems. In Tagus estuary is predicted 

a meaningful change in the salinity concentrations and distribution upstream due to sea level rising 

(Rodrigues et al., 2016). As environmental salinity is one of the major constraints to the distribution and 

colonization of plant species along salt marsh (Duarte et al, 2014c), climate change will directly affect 

the valuable salt marsh ecosystem and their communities. However, complexes and significant 

interspecific variations in the biophysical and biochemical responses to salt stress were observed in the 



 

76 

 

studied halophytes, due to their different pre-conditioned histories. This will potentially shape the future 

salt marsh communities. Our findings suggest heavy metal pre-conditioning do not have a linear 

influence throughout higher salt concentrations. Halimione portulacoides had a relatively worse 

performance when heavy metal pre-conditioned at 400 mM NaCl, on the other hand at 800 mM NaCl 

had a better performance, moreover S. patens displayed a better performance when heavy metal pre-

conditioned in both high salinities. Therefore, when the environmental salinity reaches 400 mM the 

heavy metal contaminated marsh may experience a more aggressive S. patens invasion and spreading 

than in the non-contaminated marsh, possibly signifying more negative ecological impacts in the 

contaminated salt marsh biodiversity. Nonetheless, at very high salinities such as 800 mM, both H. 

portulacoides and S. patens from the heavy metal salt marsh appear to have a higher fitness and salt 

tolerance than those form the non-contaminated marsh, meaning that it may be more resistant to nearly 

deathly salt concentrations, potentially able to survive salinities that the other marsh community could 

not. 

Thus, heavy metal pre-conditioning could potentially be a key factor to understand the species 

adaptation to the climate change reality, subsequently, halophyte species intraspecific salt tolerance 

variances due to abiotic pre-conditioning are essential when considering climate change scenarios.

Final considerations 
 

Wetlands are recognized as one of the most complex and important ecosystems in our world, 

displaying a fundamental ecological and economic role enveloping a vast array of essential services 

(Larson et al., 1989; Woodward et al., 2001). However, despite humanity intrinsically rely on the 

benefits provided by wetlands, according to the 2017 Ramsar Policy Brief 1, more than half of the 

world’s wetlands have been lost in the past one hundred years due to anthropogenic actions. 

Furthermore, this loss and ecosystem degradation continues at an alarming rate around the world, 

contributing to lower resilience to disasters and climate change. Salt marshes are coastal wetlands, 

located in low hydrodynamism estuarine areas. These ecosystems have evolved to endure harsh 

environmental conditions and fluctuations and, as stated before, are provides of a wide range of unique 

services such as coastal protection, water purification and retention, nutrient transformation, sediment 

stabilization, shelter for migratory birds, fish and shellfish nurseries, among others (Teixeira et al., 2014; 

Duarte et al., 2017). Salt marshes, due to the many abiotic and anthropogenic pressures and stressors 

that they are typically subjected, are characteristically colonized by the very resilient halophyte 

vegetation. Although halophytes plants can survive and even thrive in exceptionally stressful 

environments (Duarte et al., 2013a; 2013b; 2014; 2015), human impacts coupled with climate change 

will have profound consequences in coastal salt marshes (Simas et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006). Hence, 

the preservation of these unique ecotone is vital, and it has become a conservation priority in most 

counties. In order to predict the ongoing climate change impacts in the marsh ecosystem and its 

community a systematic understanding of physiological mechanisms underlying marsh vegetation 

resistance mechanisms might not be enough, considering that intraspecific variation as a significant 

expression within wide-raging and highly tolerant species, due to specific environmental pre-

conditioning exposure. Thereby commonly occurring halophyte species may maintain, within different 

populations, a variety of physiology, morphology, and phenology local specializations that will be have 

an influence in their feedback to future environmental stresses (Valladares et al., 2007). Moreover, 

nowadays, the potential to significant intraspecific variation between neighbor populations is more 

evident than ever, on account of human impact on a specific location and ecosystem, as shown 

previously in the heavy metal contamination of the Rosário salt marsh due to industrial activities (Duarte 

et al., 2013b). In the face of climate change, these issues are of utmost importance and in order to 

understand and protect this ecosystem, reinforcing the need to study the causal-effect relationship and 

variabilities between environmental changes and ecosystem changes. 

This study covered two wide-ranging halophyte species, a native C3 and an invasive C4, from 

two different salt marshes within Tagus Estuary, in which one, the soil, is heavy metal contaminated, in 

order to allow the understanding of a heavy metal cross-tolerance to various induced abiotic stresses. 

According to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, all scenarios predict a rise in the surface 

temperature over this century, as well as a very likely increase in the frequency and duration of heat 

wave, with great significance in the Tagus Estuary region (Guerreiro et al., 2018), inevitably affecting 

the marsh plant communities. Although negative stress signs were exhibited, both halophyte species 

presented highly efficient tolerance mechanisms to heat stress, nevertheless it was evident an 

intraspecific variation in the biophysiological and biochemical responses between both the C3 H. 

portulacoides and C4 S. patens populations. Our data suggests that, when exposed to warming treatment, 

H. portulacoides from the heavy metal contaminated location had a more efficient tolerance mechanism 

and a higher resistance to warming stress when compared to plants from the non-contaminated site. This 

was clearly displayed through the more efficient photobiological light harvesting processes found in the 

pre-conditioned H. portulacoides, as well as the lower photoprotection observed in the non-pre-

conditioned H. portulacoides. On the other hand, in S. patens, the population from the non-contaminated

marsh appear to exhibit less damage than the population from the contaminated marsh, evident by the 

photo-oxidative stress vulnerability experienced by pre-conditioned S. patens. Thus, cross-tolerance 

results indicate that pre-conditioned H. portulacoides and non-pre-conditioned S. patens are better suited 

to endure upcoming warming events than their counterparts. From this it seems reasonable to assume 

that in heavy metal contaminated marsh, the non-indigenous S. patens will suffer more severe 

consequences, while on the other hand H. portulacoides will display better performance under the same 

heat conditions, which can dissuade the invasion trend showed by the S. patens in Tagus marshes, 

favoring the indigenous community. Oppositely in non-contaminated marshes environmental changes 

will make these ecosystems prone to the invasion by this exotic species. Therefore, it can be concluded 

that the upcoming warming events boosted by climate change, will have a more serious and immediate 

ecological consequences in marsh from the non-contaminated location due to the relative enabling of 

the colonization by invasive species in the non-contaminated location, changing the marsh landscape in 

a different and possibly more negative manner, than in the heavy metal contaminated marsh. 

Climate change research also foresees the likely increase of the ongoing word-wide land 

salinization phenomenon (IPCC, 2014). Coastal regions, especially in estuaries, will experience a soil 

and water salinity increase at an elevated rate, due to sea level rise, storm and tidal surges coupled with 

increases in air temperature (Dasgupta and Hossain et al., 2015). Moreover, it is expected that Tagus 

estuary will significantly change in salinity concentrations and distribution (Rodrigues et al., 2016). This 

phenomenon will bring profound consequences to the halophyte marsh communities, since salinity 

concentration is one of the major constraints to species frequency, distribution and zonation in salt 

marshes (Silvestri et al., 2004; Duarte et al, 2014b). To understand the pre-conditioning implications in 

the salt tolerance mechanisms of this plants and their variability, biophysical and biochemical responses 

to this potential stressor were uncovered. Our study showed a complex and significant intraspecific 

variations in the H. portulacoides and S. patens salt stress responses due to their pre-conditioned 

histories, our results suggest that heavy metal pre-conditioning does not have a straightforward influence 

in the salinity tolerance mechanisms. Heavy metal pre-conditioned H. portulacoides, when compared to 

their counterpart, presented a more deficient photochemical energy production and overall worse 

performance when exposed to mild salinity, while under elevated exposure exhibited a better efficiency 

in salt tolerance mechanisms. Nonetheless, heavy metal pre-conditioned S. patens shown a higher fitness 

throughout increasing salt concentrations, displaying more effective LHC and dissipation mechanisms 

than non-pre-conditioned individuals. Therefore, it can be argued that under mild salinities the 

contaminated marsh may experience more severe ecological consequences, as result of the contrastingly 

poorer performance from this H. portulacoides population, allowing an accelerated spreading of 

invasive species, with impacts in the salt marsh biodiversity and organization. Nevertheless, elevated 

salinities, both C3 and C4 heavy metal pre-conditioned marsh plants populations exhibit better fitness 

than their counterparts, revealing that in this salt marsh there is a potentially higher salinity resistance, 

favoring contaminated marsh growing and survival, according to imminent climate change 

consequences. 

Through this work it is possible to conclude that salt marsh halophyte species tolerance and 

resilience to new abiotic factors is meaningfully influenced by their pre-conditioning history. This 

reinforces the fact that plants, with a large abiotic tolerance spectrum, have an active physiological 

plasticity according to their environmental specificity. This represents a tailored adaptation to the 

stresses present in their specific habitat, as a result of cross-tolerance, that will have significant effects 

in how plants’ mechanisms will act and respond to upcoming abiotic stresses, thus determining plant 

growth and development. It is clear that halophytes’ adaptation to the local conditions or pre-

conditioning will indirectly influence, the way the population will react to climate changes, thereby, 

influencing the salt marsh vegetation community and their ecosystem. Thus, it is far evident that 

halotolerance and thermotolerance of the previously studied plants that are clearly interconnected with 



 

83 

 

their pre-conditioning, presenting an intraspecific physiological variation with ecological sway, in how 

two neighboring salt marshes will evolve. Consequently, this key factor needs to be taken in to account 

when modeling and predicting climate change scenarios on individual salt marshes. The first steps in 

understanding pre-conditioning influence was taken by researching metal induced cross-tolerance to 

thermal and saline stresses, relying on a multidisciplinary approach, considering and correlating 

biochemical and biophysical responses and searching for ecology meaning. This examination took after 

this premise and contributed with pertinent new information to the comprehension of ecophysiological 

drivers. This can also be a tool useful to more efficiently manage appropriate conservation actions, 

highlighting the services of all salt marshes in order to be able to benefit from their unique and valuable 

resources in the future. Additionally, among these strategies, the heterogeneity between salt marsh 

habitats should also be protected to maintain intraspecific variability safeguarding a variety of 

physiological specializations that will, in some instances, result in an advantageous cross-tolerance.
