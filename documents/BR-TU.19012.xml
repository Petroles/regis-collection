dois picos intensos a 2920 cm-1 e 2850 cm-1 corroborando com dados de RMN 13C e análise

de SAP e ITA revelam maior presença de quartzo mineral. A microscopia eletrônica de varredura
(SEM) e a microscopia eletrônica de varredura ambiental (ESEM) mostraram que a superfície das
amostras de turfa possui grânulos porosos de matéria orgânica. As amostras de turfa de ITA e SAP
são semelhantes enquanto a de SAO possui alto teor de matéria orgânica. Apenas a amostra de SAO
apresenta características de turfa. Os resultados deste estudo mostraram que as amostras são muito
diferentes devido aos teores variáveis de material orgânico e inorgânico.

Peat was taken from the Sergipe State, Brazil and characterized by several techniques: elemental

spectroscopies; scanning electron microscopy (SEM), environmental scanning electron microscopy
(ESEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Also, the Sergipe State peat samples were compared with
other peat sample from later from Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The lowest O/C and E

differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves of the Santo Amaro (SAO) sample indicated that this
sample had the highest degree of decomposition. FTIR results showed that Itabaiana (ITA) and São
Paulo (SAP) samples presented more prominent peak at 1086 cm-1 attributed the presence of Si-O
than SAO sample spectra. The SAO sample showed two more intense peaks at 2920 cm-1 and 2850
cm-1. These results were corroborated by 13C NMR and thermal gravimetric (TG) where the relative
abundance of the alkyl-C groups was greater in the SAO sample. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD)
of SAO sample is characteristic of amorphous matter however, the SAP and ITA samples revealed
the large presence of quartz mineral. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and environmental
scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) showed that the surface of peat samples have porous granules
of organic material. The ITA and SAP peat samples are alike while SAO peat sample is richer in
organic material. Only the SAO sample has truthful characteristics of peat. The results of this study
showed that the samples are very different due to variable inorganic and organic material contents.

Introduction

Peat is formed primarily from inhibited decomposition
of various plant materials in the waterlogged environment
of marshes, bogs and swamps. 1,2 Natural peats,
continuously formed by complex humification processes
from plant residues, are important reservoirs of refractory
organic carbon in aquatic environments. Due to their high
content of humic substances, natural peats exhibit
favourable chemical-physical properties enabling their
useful application in various technical areas, for instance
wastewater treatment, pollution monitoring, fuel
production, in soil fertilizing, as well as, in veterinary
and human medicine. Previous work has established that
the ability of humic substances to bind heavy metal ions
can be attributed to their high content of oxygen-
containing functional groups, including carboxyl, phenol,
hydroxyl, enol and carbonyl structures of various types.3-
6 Humic substances are classified according to their
solubility in water as humic acids, fulvic acids and humin.
The last is the fraction with the highest molecular weight
and highest carbon content of the three humic fractions.
In addition, humin is extremely porous and, as a
consequence, the surface area is very large. The
availability of pores and internal surface are useful in the
adsorption process.7 Clay mineral constituents, such as
kaolinite and montmorillonite, are also found in peat
samples, and contribute to the high adsorption capacity
attributed to net negative charge on the structure of silicate
minerals. This negative charge is neutralized by the
adsorption of positively charged species, such as heavy
metals.5 Thus, organic-rich and mineral-rich peat samples
can be different in their binding capacity for metals (e.g.
chromium).

The need for controlling heavy metals emissions into
the environment is even more pronounced due to
exponentially increasing human populations, which can
be exposed once the metallic species enter the ecosystem.
Nowadays, under the public and media pressure,
governments introduce and progressively enforce stricter
regulations with regard to metal discharges particularly
for industrial operations.8

For this reason, increased attention is being focused
on effective and inexpensive technologies capable of
treating large quantities of wastewater. The advantage of
biosorption lies in using biomass raw materials (e.g. peat)
which are easily available and can be selective particularly
to heavy metals. The last aspect is important and may be
achieved by manipulating the properties or characteristics
of a biosorbent. Besides, subsequent desorption for
recovery/reuse of metals as well as regeneration/reuse of

the biosorbent are crucially important for keeping the
process costs down and to prevent creation of secondary
problems with metal-bearing sludges which are extremely
difficult for disposal. These concepts are considered in
principles of green chemistry which underpin this kind of
research.8-10

Due to their extreme heterogeneity and natural variety,
chemical attributes of peat can vary widely among
different peat deposits, and the characterization of isolated
peat samples and their manifold effects is still a
challenging task in environmental analytical chemistry
requiring efficient combinations of powerful chemical and
spectroscopic methodologies.

In the present paper we have applied a new multi-
method approach, consisting of elemental and thermal
analyses, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), solid state
13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), environmental scanning
electron microscopy (ESEM) and X-ray diffractometry
(XRD), to study the structure and properties of typical
Brazilian peat samples. Such a multimethod concept is
an important prerequisite for a reliable assessment of
beneficial peat effects in the environment. Chromium
sorption onto different peat fractions will be reported in a
forthcoming paper.

Experimental

Peat samples

Three peat samples have been collected from two
different regions of Sergipe State, Brazil, Itabaiana (ITA)
and Santo Amaro (SAO), and one from Sao Paulo (SAP)
State, Brazil. The raw peat was dried in an oven at 100 °C
for 24 h and then sieved though a 9 mesh sieve and
analysed without further treatment.

 ratios were determined by dissolving 2.0 mg of peat

in 10 mL of 0.05 mol L-1 NaHCO

 solution (pH 9.0 in all

cases)12 and by measuring optical densities at 465 and
665 nm on a Hitachi U 2000 spectrophotometer.

Infrared spectroscopy

The peat samples (0.035 g each) were mixed with 0.35
g of KBr (spectroscopic grade) at the biomass/KBr ratio

1:10. The mixtures were then pressed into pellets for FTIR
analysis. The spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 730 SX-
FT spectrometer on a spectral range of 4000-400 cm-1.

Solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy

The samples (120 a 150 mg) were crushed and ground
into powder prior to analysis. Spectra were recorded on a
Varian INOVA-300 spectrometer working at 75.4 MHz (13C).
13C spectra were recorded with a spinning frequency of 3000
Hz, a 90° pulse and acquisition time of 6 s. The reference at
0 ppm was SiMe

4
. Chemical shifts were assigned according

to Swift (1996):13 alkyl-C from 0 to 65 ppm; O-alkyl-C from
65 to 110 ppm; aromatic-C from 110 to 140 ppm; phenolic-
C from 140 to 160 ppm; carboxylic-C from 160 to 190 ppm
and carbonyl-C from 190 to 220 ppm.

Thermal analyses

For DTA and (TG) analysis, about 8 mg of peat
samples were ground with a mortar and pestle and sieved
through a 70 mesh sieve to homogenize them. After the
samples were heated continuously from 40 to 1000 °C
at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 in an atmosphere of
synthetic air (99.999%, 20% O

2
 and 80% N

2
) (100 mL

min-1) and in an alumina crucible. In the differential
thermal analysis the temperature difference between
sample and inert reference material (?-alumina) was
measured. DTA and TG curves were recorded simul-
taneously using TA Instruments SDT-2960. The thermal
analyses were done in duplicate with a standard deviation
of 0.1%.

X-ray diffractometer

Detailed mineralogical studies of peat samples were
carried out using a X-ray diffraction (SIEMENS D-5000)
with CuK?, step time 1 s, step size 0.05 dg and wave
length 1.54 Å.

Scanning Electron Microscopy

Measurements were performed using a JSM T330A
SEM in ultra high vaccum. Peat samples were placed onto

clean electron microscopy support stubs, coated with gold
in an Emscope SC 500 sputter coater.

Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy

All measurements were carried out in a FEI XL-30
FEG-ESEM in wet mode, fitted with a water cooled Peltier
stage fitted. All images were obtained at 2 °C and the
pressure altered below 10 Torr to maintain humidities
between 25 and 100%. Samples were imaged with a
gaseous secondary electron detector using 10 kV electron
beam and using H

2
O for the vapour skirt.

Results and Discussion

The elemental analyses, elemental ratios, dry ash and

 are listed in Table 1. The decomposition of

organic material present in the peat samples tends to lead
to the formation of phenolic structures derived from lignin.
It is harder for these structures to suffer degradation
compared with sugars and proteins.11 The H/C and O/C
ratios are indicators for the percentage saturation of the C
atoms within the organic molecule and of the carbohydrate
content respectively. Lower H/C ratios indicate higher
aromaticity in the samples. There are similarities between
the H/C ratios of the samples and the values in the
literature, indicating considerable aromaticity.14 The
lowest O/C ratio of the SAO sample indicates the lowest
carbohydrate level and/or the highest organic content of
that peat sample.15

The measure of E
4 
/E

6
 ratio is a simple spectroscopic

property which has been used to characterize the progress
of decomposition.12 This ratio has been correlated
negatively with increasing content of condensed aromatic
structures.16

All together, the results indicate that the SAO peat is
highly humified and rich in organics, while the other two
peats contain less organic matter of different composition.

Figure 1 shows the infrared spectra of the different
peat samples. The spectra characteristics are broad bands
typical of natural organic matter due to superposition of
individual absorptions bands.17 The most consistent
features of these spectra are: a) a broad band around 3400
cm-1 due to O-H stretching of various groups like phenols

and alcohol; b) two peaks at 2920 cm-1 and 2850 cm-1 due
to C-H stretching; c) a peak at 1626 cm-1 assigned to
aromatic C=C stretching; d) a strong peak at 1086 cm-1

due to Si-O stretching.17

The ITA and SAP samples presented more prominent
peak at 1086 cm-1 than SAO sample spectra, indicating
more Si-O groups present. In addition the SAO spectra
contained two more prominent peaks at 2920 cm-1 and
2850 cm-1. Most likely, these peaks are due to stretching
C-H due to C alkyl and are much less pronounced in the
less organic ITA and SAP samples.

The chemical shifts assignments of 13C-NMR spectra
and their relative abundance obtained are given in Table 2.

All three peat samples are highly aromaticity and slow
similarities with the literature data for coal humic acid
(HA).18 In addition, Gondar et al.19 has shown that alkyl-
C were the dominant C components in peat humic acids
(HA) and fulvic acids (FA). In particular, the FA contains
more alkyl-C and carboxylic carbon but less O-alkyl-C
and aromatic-C than the corresponding HA. The
abundance of alkyl-C groups was greater in the SAO
sample than others and this is consistent with the results
from the FTIR analysis. The results of ITA and SAP
samples showed similarities each other and were different
when compared with SAO sample.

The DTA curves are given in Figure. 2 and indicate
exothermic reactions in all samples, due to the oxidation
of organic matter. In a TG analysis the mass of a sample in
a controlled atmosphere is recorded continously as a
function of temperature or time as the temperature of the
sample is increased. The SAO sample shows an endothermic
peak near to 100 °C accompanied by weight loss of 5% of
dehydration of sample (Figure 3). This sample shows higher
exothermic effect between 300-400 °C and 500 °C. This
indicated that SAO has higher organic matter and these
results are corroborated with the dry ash, O/C and E

ratios and FTIR. According to Leinweber and Schulten,20

the exothermic effect in this temperature range can be more
pronounced with greater peat formation time.

The weight loss curves in Figure 3 shows that the
decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) increases at
300 °C and is largely completed before 600 °C. The weight
loss of the peat samples in different range of temperature
are shown in the Table 3. In that range of temperature the
higher variation of weight occured to the SAO sample
(9.93%), while in the others the variation was almost 2%
probably, due to greater organic matter content of that
sample. Tikhova et al.21 have shown that exothermic
reaction in the range of 280-320 °C corresponds to the
thermal decomposition of aliphatic chain and carboxyl
groups attached to it. This indicates higher presence of
alkyl groups in that SAO sample and this is corroborated
with the results from 13C NMR.

718 Structure and Properties of Brazilian Peat: Analysis by Spectroscopy and Microscopy J. Braz. Chem. Soc.

Detailed examination of the mineralogy of the peat
samples using XRD is shown in the Figure 4. The XRD
of SAO sample (Figure 4a1) is characteristic of
amorphous matter with a hump, between 18° and 32°.
Bozkurt et al.15 analyzing the processes involved in peat
formation, recognized an anaerobic thick structural layer,
which is formed of residual material from the original
plant structure, decay products and new substances
produced mainly by bacteria. At this level peat would
be amorphous and highly humified. However, only the
XRD of dry ash or residue of that sample revealed

mineral characteristics with presence of quartz mineral
and some clay material. These materials were recovered
by the organic matter of peat (Figure 4a2). The XRD of
SAP and ITA samples revealed the large presence of
quartz mineral (Figure 4b and 4c). This feature is more
related with mineral characteristic of those samples,
which were observed in the FTIR spectra and the higher
results of dry ash in that samples.

SEM and ESEM are shown in Figures 5 and 6,
respectively. There are similarities between the two
techniques, SEM and ESEM of the samples have shown
that the surface of peat samples have porous granules of
organic material. Therefore, there are differences between
them. SEM images are more densely packed due to drying
process and an ultra high vacuum (Figure 5). ESEM is a

new technique capable of imaging micron and submicron
particles and can image wet samples and cycle between
wet and dry states.22,23 The use of high humidity and low
vacuum preserve the structure of material and give more
realistic results. Typical aggregate structures of natural
organic matter have been observed in SAO sample.
Analysis of ITA and SAP samples yielded the results
regarding those samples rich in mineral components
(Figure 6). These results are corroborated with the dry
ash, FTIR, DTA, TG and XRD.

Conclusions

 The results of this study using XRD, SEM, ESEM,
thermal and elemental analyses showed that the samples
are very different due to variable inorganic and organic
material contents. The XRD analysis showed that only
the SAO sample possessed true characteristics of peat.
All three peat samples showed high aromaticity but
13C NMR and FTIR spectroscopies and thermal analysis
showed that the abundance of alkyl-C groups was greater

in the SAO sample than in others. The presence of these
groups is likely to influence metal binding capacity;
therefore the capabilities of peat sorbent in technological
processes should be investigated in column experiments
with manipulation and alteration of their physico-chemical
properties. The complex relationship of sorption efficiency
with organic and mineral contents of peat samples, which
ultimately govern their environmental and economic
potentials, can only be studied in detail by a multimethod
approach.
