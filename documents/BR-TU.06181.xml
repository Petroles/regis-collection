ABSTRACT

Tobacco production in Southern Brazil has caused
a profound impact in the environment, resulting in heavy
sediment yields and diminishing water quality. Public
programmes have attempted to address these problems by
encouraging the implementation of erosion control practices.
To evaluate the impact of these programmes, a small rural
catchment (1.33km2) in Arvorezinha county, in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul, Brazil, has been monitored since 2001.
Instruments to automatically monitor flow rate and precipitation
were installed in the catchment and sediment has been measured
manually using a DH-48 sampler. Despite lower rainfall in
2003, there was a significant increase in the frequency of low
and average flow rates, and sediment yield increased 25% in
2003 (91Mg km-2 year-1), compared with 2002 (73Mg km-2
year-1). These results can be explained by a 37.7% increase in
the area dedicated to tobacco cultivation in 2003, due to a rise
in tobacco prices.

Key words:  erosion; catchment monitoring.

RESUMO

A produção de fumo no sul do Brasil tem causado
um profundo impacto no meio ambiente, resultando em alta
de produção de sedimentos e diminuindo a qualidade da água.
Programas públicos têm se esforçado para resolver estes
problemas com a implementação de práticas de controle de
erosão. Para avaliar o impacto destes programas, uma pequena
bacia rural (1,33km2) em Arvorezinha, no estado do Rio Grande
do Sul, tem sido monitorada desde 2001. Instrumentos

automáticos de medição da vazão e precipitação foram
instalados na bacia e os sedimentos foram medidos com um
amostrador manual do tipo DH48. Apesar de ter chovido menos
em 2003, houve um aumento significativo na freqüência das
vazões de estiagem e médias, e um aumento de 25% na
produção de sedimentos em 2003 (91Mg km-2 year -1)
comparado com 2002 (73Mg km-2 year-1). Estes resultados
podem ser explicados por um aumento de 37,7% na área
dedicada ao cultivo de fumo em 2003, devido ao aumento no
preço do fumo.

Most of the tobacco in Southern Brazil is
produced in small farms on land with low agricultural
potential. Steep hillsides, combined with traditional
cultivation practices, have caused rapid degradation
of natural resources, contributing to a worsening of
the cycle of poverty. Traditional cultivation practices
are characterized by the use of draft animals to till the
soil prior to transplant tobacco seedlings. There is no
soil conservation practices and an excessive use of
agrochemicals. In addition, the period of greatest rainfall
erosivity coincides with the beginning of the planting
cycle, when soil cover is minimal (SILVA, 2004). This
combination of factors favours runoff erosion and the
transfer of sediment to rivers. This sediment, in turn,

causes river siltation and a reduction in water quality
due to the agricultural chemicals and nutrients
transported by sediment (MERTEN &amp;amp; MINELLA,
2005). Longer-term investigations of British rivers
shows evidence of increases in the nutrient content of
sediment deposited in the flood plain store (WALLING,
1999). In an effort to attenuate this situation in southern
Brazil, the government has implemented programmes
that include the introduction of soil conservation
practices, with the goal of reducing erosion rates (SAA,
1999). To evaluate the effectiveness of these
programmes, an environmental monitoring project was
initiated in 2001 to quantify the impact of the
conservation practices on soil quality, the
hydrosedimentological regime, and water quality, in a
small rural catchment. In 2003, a 20% increase in the
price of tobacco stimulated an expansion of the
cultivated area, with results measurable through the
monitoring programme. This study presents the
monitoring results, showing the link between sediment
yield and land-use pressure, triggered by economic
factors.

The catchment being monitored measures
1.33km2 and includes the headwaters of the Lajeado
Ferreira Stream, a small tributary of the Guaporé River
located in Arvorezinha county, state of Rio Grande do
Sul. Altitude varies between 560 and 740m. The geology
is predominantly basalt, with rolling terrain in the upper
portion (7% average slope), and steeply rolling terrain,
characterized by short slopes and box canyons, in the
lower two-thirds. Average channel slope is 9%, with
runoff concentration time varying between 20 and 50
min. Predominant soils are Inceptisols and Entisols.
Average annual precipitation is 1605mm.
Socioeconomic indicators classify the region as
possessing one of the highest indices of rural poverty
in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

To evaluate the hydrological and
sedimentological variables of the catchment, an
automatic meteorological station, four raingauges, and
a Parshall flume with an automatic water level sensor
were installed. The rate of suspended sediment
discharge was determined indirectly using US DH-48
and Single Stage sampler (CARVALHO, 1994).
Transport of suspended sediment only occurs during
rainstorms, so the frequency of sediment sampling
corresponds with the majority of these events.
Sediment yield was calculated based on the sampled
events, using hydrographs and sedimentographs.
Changes in soil use were determined by field surveys,
assisted by a GPS with Spring/INPE® software. Principal
soil uses in the catchment consist of cultivated tobacco
fields, pasture, fallow, and forest. Fields showing signs

of reduced productivity typically are left fallow for at
least two years. The category forest includes areas of
native forest, trees planted to supply firewood for
drying tobacco, and riparian zones.

Significant changes in soil use were
measured in the catchment during 2003. A 37.7%
increase in cultivated area occurred at the expense of
other soil uses, especially forested areas, which were
reduced in 19.9%. Of special note, riparian vegetation
was diminished by 10%. It increased the sediment
transfer from the hillslopes to the channel, as riparian
vegetation plays a key role in retaining sediment. A
second aspect was a drastic change in lowland area.
Many lowlands adjacent to the Lajeado Ferreira Stream
were drained during the first half of 2003 and put into
cultivation, thus contributing to an increase in surface
runoff and the creation of new sediment sources. In
2002, the frequency of low flows (&lt;2.9L s-1) was 1.6%,
while in 2003 it increased to 36%. At the same time,
floods of much greater intensity were observed in 2003.

The expansion of the area under tobacco
cultivation that occurred in 2003 significantly altered
the sediment balance for the catchment. This was
registered by increases in the frequency of higher
suspended sediment concentrations and in increasing
sediment yield. A comparison between 2002 and 2003
clearly indicates that in 2003 there was a greater
frequency of concentrations greater than 600mg L-1,
whereas in 2002, concentrations of less than 450mg L-1
predominated (Figure 1).

The average flow rate and precipitation in
2003 were slightly lower than in 2002; however, there
were flow spikes of up to 6000L s-1 during 2003, whereas
in 2002, the highest flow rate did not exceed 1200L s-1
(Table 1). This fact is certainly associated with wetland
drainage and with the larger area of soil exposed during
field preparation.

Values for precipitation, erosivity, flow rate,
and sediment yield were grouped according to the
different activities involved in tobacco production
(Table 1). Sediment yield in 2003 (91Mg km-2 year-1)
was 25% higher than in 2002 (73Mg km-2 year-1) (Table 1).
During the period from July to October alone, sediment
yield for 2003 approximated the total yearly yield for
2002. It is interesting to note that 80% of the sediment
yield for 2003 occurred during three rainfall events
registered in July. This was due to the presence of
countless newly worked areas, especially in the
headwaters of the Lajeado Ferreira Stream, in which
riparian vegetation had been removed, as well as to the
presence of large quantities of sediment deposited next
to the stream channel as a result of wetland drainage. It
is also worth noting that the sediment yield values for

the catchment are much higher than those found during
a 1998 survey of principal Brazilian rivers, in which the
sediment yield for the middle section of the Guaporé
River was estimated at around 23Mg km-2 year-1
(ELETROBRÁS, 1998).

In field surveys carried out after the events,
many gullies were observed in the steeper areas where
runoff erosion was more severe, as well as a striking
change in the morphology of the stream channel due
to sediment deposition. It is likely that these deposits
will constitute an important sediment source during
the next few years, contributing significantly to the
catchment’s sediment yield.

Based on the monitoring results of the
hydrological and sedimentological characteristics of
the Lajeado Ferreira Stream, it was possible to conclude
that the shift to more intensive tobacco production in
ecologically-fragile areas, such as wetlands, riparian
zones, and steep slopes, resulted in severe impacts on
the hydrological system and sediment yield. Given that
tobacco is grown by very poor farmers on marginal
lands, the economic stimulus represented by a price
increase can greatly accelerate the process of
environmental degradation, unless accompanied by an
equal or greater stimulus to implement adequate
environmental protection, especially improved soil
management practices.
