Resumo 
 

Minerais e argilominerais em sucessões sedimentares são excelente ferramentas para a 

reconstrução de condições ambientais. Dado o estado de preservação dos argilominerais, 

é possível identificar como eles foram formados, fornecendo informação sobre as 

condições de intemperismo no continente e sobre condições geoquímicas na coluna 

d’água. Este estudo apresenta novos dados mineralógicos da seção de Baskil, uma 

sucessão do Eoceno médio altamente preservada no Neo-Tethys (Turquia central). Uma 

mudança na assembléia mineralógica com maiores concentrações de ilita e clorita 

(subseção I) para um intervalo dominante de esmectita detrítica (subseção II) caracteriza 

uma mudança na área de fonte de rochas metamórficas para rochas ígneas e mudanças de 

condições de intemperismo físico para intemperismo químico. Este período coincide com 

o Ótimo Climático do Eoceno Médio (MECO), indicando uma assinatura mineralógica 

do evento. A paligorsquita autigênica teve um aumento na porção media e superior da 

seção, indicando condições favoráveis na coluna de água para a sua formação. 

Possívelmente as condições na circulação do oceano naquela região mudaram após 40 

Ma, formando uma coluna de água estratificada com condições mais quentes e salinas em 

profundidades maiores, favorecendo precipitação de paligorsquita e dolomita. A evolução 

mineralógica da seção de Baskil reflete como as fontes e os regimes de intemperismo 

mudaram ao longo do tempo, e como essas mudanças podem estar relacionadas aos 

processos globais (e.g. MECO) e /ou a processos locais e regionais.

Abstract 
 

Minerals and clay minerals in continental sedimentary successions are valuable tools for 

reconstructing past environmental conditions. Given the state of preservation of clays 

minerals, it is possible to identify how they were formed, providing clues about 

continental weathering conditions (inherited minerals) and geochemical conditions in the 

water column (neoformed or transformed). This study presents new mineralogical data 

from the Baskil section, a highly preserved middle Eocene succession in the Neo-Tethys 

(central Turkey). A gradual shift from a well-crystalline illite and chlorite interval 

(interval I) to a detrital smectite dominant interval (interval II) characterizes a change in 

source area from metamorphic to igneous rocks and changes from physical to chemical 

weathering conditions on land. This period coincides with the Middle Eocene Climatic 

Optimum (MECO), indicating a mineralogical signature of the event. Higher content of 

terrigenous input being deposited from 40.5 to 40 Ma caused a dilution effect of the 

carbonate materials as calcite and dolomite significantly decreases. Authigenic 

palygorskite showed an increasing trend from the middle to the uppermost portion of the 

section, indicating favorable conditions in the water column for its formation. We assume 

that conditions in the ocean circulation changed after 40 Ma, forming a stratified water 

column with warmer and saline conditions at greater depths, favoring palygorskite and 

possibly authigenic dolomite precipitation. The mineralogical evolution of the Baskil 

section reflects how sources and weathering regimes changed through time, and how 

these changes can be related to global (i.e. MECO) and/or local to regional processes.

1.Introduction 

 The Earth has experienced vast periods of climatic and environmental changes 

throughout its history. If we look at only the Phanerozoic, going back approximately 540 

Ma, a relatively small slice of time (when compared to ~ 4 Billion years ago; the planets’ 

origin), we have seen five major extinction events, changed from a hot (greenhouse) to a 

cold planet (icehouse), the ocean chemistry has changed, and continents have collided to 

form incredibly high mountain ranges, and drifted apart opening oceans with abyssal 

depths. It seems, in my humble opinion, that disequilibrium has always been present in 

Earth’s system, but at the same time, it has found its way to evolve and main life as it is 

today. 

 This ongoing evolutionary process perpetuates, and climatic and environmental 

changes are now being modulated by us, humans (homo sapiens), who have been around 

for approximately 200 kyr ago. The well-known and extensively used example is the rise 

in global surface temperatures. Could these past warmer geological periods have anything 

in common with our present, and most importantly with our near future? A recent study 

made by (FOSTER et al., 2017) showed that by the 23rd century climate could reach a 

warmth never seen in the past 420 million years. Understanding the underlying 

mechanism, such as causes, effects and duration of past climatic and environmental 

changes could potentially give us clues regarding our close warmer future.  

 My motivation for this study was mainly to be working on a geological period of 

approximately 40 Ma, in which climate was at a transition phase from greenhouse to 

icehouse conditions. During this cooling trend in the Eocene Epoch, a global warming 

event took place, which is still not well understood. My study was to look at clay minerals 

to try to understand environmental conditions over middle Eocene, how and what factors 

influenced their mineralogical changes. Were they related to climate, source rocks or 



 2 

environmental conditions? Maybe a combination of all these? I hope by answering these 

questions we can have a better understanding of what was happening in in the past, and 

maybe, one day, we could know if this would happen in the future.   

 

1.1 The origin of clay minerals: a brief overview 

 Clay minerals form about one-third of all present sedimentary rocks and are the 

most abundant minerals at the surface of the Earth (MOORE; REYNOLDS, 1997). This 

group of hydrous silicate minerals are composed of two-dimensional Si-bearing 

tetrahedral, and Al-bearing octahedral sheets stacked in a regular arrangement (FAGEL, 

2007). Despite their abundancy, clays1 are highly demanded for industrial purposes 

(MURRAY, 2007). Properties such as adsorption, catalysis and plasticity turned them 

into useful tools from the development of traditional ceramics to modern nanotechnology 

research (ZHOU; KEELING, 2013). Additionally, understanding clay minerals formation 

processes, dispersal patterns and state of preservation and/or alteration can provide 

valuable information regarding source areas and how past environmental conditions 

changed through the geological time (CHAMLEY, 1989; VELDE, 1995; MERRIMAN, 

2005; MORTON, 2005; EHLMANN et al., 2011).  

 Clay minerals originates mostly from the alteration of pre-existing minerals, 

through weathering processes, which in turns initiates the “clay cycle” proposed by 

MERRIMAN (2005) (Figure 1). This near-surface alteration process leads to the 

development of soils and an array of different pedogenic profiles which will later be 

partially and/or entirely eroded, transported and deposited into sedimentary basins 

(GALÁN, 2006). Inherited clays, also known as detrital clays, are transported to the 

                                                
1 The terms clays and clay minerals will be used to refer to phyllosilicates and not the clay size fraction 
(&lt;2 µm), unless stated otherwise. 



 3 

sedimentary basins with no or only little modification, consequently giving information 

about the weathering conditions on the adjacent land-masses where they were formed 

(VELDE, 1995). This process usually occurs in two ways: (1) physical breakdown of 

parent rocks (physical weathering) and through (2) dissolution of pre-existing clays and 

non-clay minerals, which under normal pH conditions hydrolysis is the main component 

involved (chemical weathering) (CHAMLEY, 1989).  

 

Figure 1: The clay cycle as proposed by Merriman (2005) showing different clay formation and alteration 
processes (MERRIMAN, 2005).  

As time goes by, these deposits become thicker, and buried clays are likely to be 

transformed in response to geothermal conditions and/or geotectonic evolution of the 

basin (MERRIMAN, 2005).These clays are referred to as authigenic, which means they 

were formed in situ. Even though they are considered as a minor component of clay 

minerals (VELDE, 1995), they can still characterize geochemical conditions where they 



 4 

originated. However, is important to mention that any sing of diagenesis2 can mask or 

erase completely the climatic signal imprinted by detrital clays (SINGER, 1984; THIRY, 

2000).  In addition, neoformation processes occurs either from minerals precipitating 

from solution, given a specific environmental condition, or from crystallization of 

amorphous minerals (EBERL, 1984). Once the superficial or buried rocks and sediments 

are uplifted, the clay cycle reinitiates.   

 Despite climatic conditions, a combination of other factors such as parent material 

(rock-type), topography and time will determine which clays mineral assemblages are 

found in a specific continental and/or marine sedimentary succession (GALÁN, 2006). 

Detrital smectite formed in soils is a product of chemical weathering and it is normally 

associated with alteration of volcanic materials (CHAMLEY, 1989; LIU et al., 2003; 

LIMMER et al., 2012) under warm conditions in areas of low-lying poorly drained soils 

with contrasting dry and wet seasons (ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1991; WILSON, 1998; 

FRANKE; EHRMANN, 2010). On the other hand, kaolinite is usually formed under 

warm and wet conditions with strong leaching associated to tropical regions (THIRY, 

2000). Illite and chlorite are usually inherited from crystalline rocks, through alteration 

of muscovite and biotite, and are typically found in higher latitudes where physical 

weathering prevails (EHRMANN; SETTI; MARINONI, 2005; BORCHERS et al., 2011). 

The fibrous clay palygorskite, however, is more often neoformed or transformed in soils, 

shallow-marine environments, and in the deep-sea. These Mg-rich clays are characteristic 

of arid and semi-arid climates (e.g. Mediterranean region) when formed in soils and in 

shallow-marine environments (HILLIER, 1995). However, to precipitate in sediments 

from deep-sea locations, warmer, saline and alkaline conditions are required with 

                                                
2 The term is used to refer to “all of the changes that a sediment undergoes after deposition and before the 
transition to metamorphism” (MIT).

favorable Si and Mg activities (PLETSCH, 2001; GALÁN; POZO, 2011; THIRY; 

PLETSCH, 2011). 

 

1.2 Clay minerals as weathering proxies 

 Previous studies have used the distribution and abundances of clay minerals 

assemblages in surface sediments from oceanic basins (BISCAYE, 1965; GRIFFIN; 

WINDOM; GOLDBERG, 1968; KOLLA; HENDERSON; VENKATARATHNAM; 

BISCAYE, 1973; BISCAYE, 1976) and the world oceans (RATEEV et al., 1969; 

WINDOM, 1976; RATEEV; SADCHIKOVA; SHABROVA, 2008) to establish 

distribution patterns related to latitudinal climate regimes, weathering conditions, wind 

regimes, river discharge and ocean currents (Figure 2). Higher concentrations of kaolinite 

are in low latitudes where there is prevailing chemical weathering under warm and humid 

conditions (Figure 2a). Illite and chlorite reach their maximum values in middle to low 

latitudes, particularly in the northern hemisphere indicating detrital origin due the large 

land-masses, where physical weathering dominates (Figure 2b, c). Smectite is abundant 

in the south Pacifc, indicating a volcanic origin (Figure 2d) (STEIN, 2016). 



 6 

 

Figure 2: Distribution of kaolinite (a), illite (b), chlorite (c), and smectite (d) in superficial sediments 
from the world ocean (after STEIN, 2016). 

This relationship between clay mineral assemblages in surface sediments and 

modern climate conditions gave scientists the possibility to go back in the geological time 

through sediment cores and continental succession and infer paleoceanographic and 

paleoclimatic conditions (e.g. FAGEL; ROBERT; HILLAIRE-MARCEL, 1996; 

PETSCHICK; KUHN; GINGELE, 1996; X. GINGELE et al., 2002; EHRMANN; 

SETTI; MARINONI, 2005; ALIZAI et al., 2012; CHEN et al., 2016). Epochs of 

significant climatic changes, such as the ones observed at the beginning of the Cenozoic 

Era (e.g. Eocene Epoch), are ideally to test whether clays respond to such changes from 

a regional to a global context.  

 

1.3 Climatic conditions during the Eocene  

The Eocene epoch (56 – 38 Myr ago) was marked by a long-term cooling trend 

interrupted by a series of warmer transient periods (ZACHOS et al., 2001; ZACHOS; 



 7 

DICKENS; ZEEBE, 2008) (Figure 3). Such climatic perturbations were typically 

identified by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) and carbonate dissolution on the 

sea-floor, which included short-duration events such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal 

Maximum (PETM) ( ZACHOS et al., 2005; WESTERHOLD et al., 2007) and the Early 

Eocene hyperthermals (LOURENS et al., 2005; GALEOTTI et al., 2010; SEXTON et al., 

2011; COCCIONI et al., 2012; WESTERHOLD; RÖHL; LASKAR, 2012). Additionally, 

longer-duration events like the early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) and the still 

enigmatic middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) ( BOHATY; ZACHOS, 2003; 

BOHATY et al., 2009; SLUIJS et al., 2013) left their imprints in continental and oceanic 

sedimentary successions. 

Earth’s climate is changing towards warmer conditions that are similar to other 

warmer periods in Earth history, such as during the Eocene, which have been identified 

using various proxies, including specific mineral assemblages ( ROBERT; KENNET, 

1994; WANG et al., 2011; BORNEMANN et al., 2014; PUJALTE; BACETA; 

SCHMITZ, 2015; KEMP et al., 2016). Stratigraphic changes in clay mineral suites are a 

valuable tool for the reconstruction of environmental history on global to regional scales 

( VELDE, 1995; CHEN; LIU; KISSEL, 2017). Provided that the diagenesis has not erased 

the climate signal and only detrital clay minerals are present, these are reliable minerals 

for paleoenvironmental reconstructions (THIRY, 2000), and additionally can indicate 

potential source areas and infer oceanic circulation patterns (e.g. FAGEL; ROBERT; 

HILLAIRE-MARCEL, 1996; PETSCHICK; KUHN; GINGELE, 1996; X. GINGELE et 

al., 2002).

al., 2008). 

 

This study characterizes the minerals and clay mineral assemblages from a well-

preserved Neo-Tethys succession in central Turkey, which expands through the middle 

Eocene. We test the hypothesis that variations in clay minerals reflect potential terrestrial 

source areas and climatic conditions. In addition, we relate changes in the clay mineral 

assemblages to the terrestrial environmental conditions resulting from global warming 

during the MECO warming period,  for which only a few studies exist (BOSBOOM; 

GUO, 2014; METHNER et al., 2016). 

 

1.4 Hypothesis 

Previous studies, as mentioned above, have shown that depending on climate and 

environmental conditions a specific group of clay minerals can be formed. During warmer 

intervals, smectite and kaolinite are often observed as product of chemical weathering, 

while illite and chlorite are characteristic of colder intervals due to physical weathering. 

Since we are studying a period in which global temperatures rose, our hypothesis is based 

on an increase of smectite and/or kaolinite during the warming phase (product of chemical 



 9 

weathering) and increase in illite and chlorite during cold phase (product of physical). 

Source rocks also influence the mineralogy and consideration regarding the geology of 

the Elazig basin is taken in combination with climatic and environmental conditions. 

 

2. Objectives 

 Characterize the mineralogical assemblages from a terrestrial succession in 

central Turkey through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy 

(SEM) in order to obtain information on potential source areas and on prevailing 

paleoenvironmental conditions during the middle Eocene. 

2.1 Specific Objectives 

a.) Determine the bulk and clay mineralogy for the studied succession through a 

semi-quantitative method; 

b.) Correlate minerals and clay minerals with actual and potential source rocks to 

infer their origin and changes in sources through the studied interval; 

c.) Analyze selected samples through SEM to determine if minerals are 

characteristic of a detrital or authigenic formation; 

d.) Correlate trends of minerals and clay minerals’ relative abundancy with a 

global warming period and identify possible environmental conditions during 

their time of deposition 

 

3. Geological Context (Study Area) 

 The studied stratigraphic succession, the Baskil section, occurs in central 

Turkey and is part of the K?rkgeçit Formation, in the Elaz?? basin, 19.8 km NW of the 

town of Baskil (located at 38°36’30.34’’N, 38°36’03.46’’E) (Figure 4). This section 



 10 

measures 357 msl (stratigraphic meters from the base of the section) with a paleodepth of 

~300-600 m (RODELLI et al., in 2017), which is composed mainly of thick-bedded to 

massive hemipelagic marlstone, formed by a mix of carbonate with fine-grained clastic 

rock (DONOVAN; PICKERILL, 2013), intercalated with calcarenite beds. Accumulation 

of large benthic foraminifera (LBF) within the calcarenite beds, which range from 15 cm 

to ~1 m thick, has been previously reported (ÖZCAN et al., 2006). The age model for the 

Baskil section was presented by RODELLI et al. (2017), and extends from 41.7 to 37.2 

Ma. 

The K?rkgeçit Formation (dark grey portion of the map on Figure 4) has an E–W 

oriented area of approximately 40 km wide and 100 km long, which consists of clastic 

deep-water and shelf deposits fed from a subaerially-exposed hinterland ( ÖZKUL; 

KEREY, 1996; CRONIN et al., 2000). These hemipelagic sediments are interpreted to be 

deposited in a back-arc basin on continental crust (CRONIN et al., 2007; ÇELIK, 2013). 

Furthermore, within the K?rkgeçit Formation, the Baskil section has not been deformed 

and does not show alteration despite the regional active tectonic regime. The good state 

of preservation of the section makes this location a primary target to develop proxies for 

paleoclimatic, paleoceanographic, and biotic events (RODELLI et al., 2017).

K?rkgeçit Formation and the location of the Baskil section (modified after ÇELIK, 2013). 

The basement units for the Cenozoic sediments in the Elaz?? basin are the Permo-

Triassic Keban metamorphic rocks and the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Elaz?? 



 12 

Magmatic rocks (AKSOY; TÜRKMEN; TURAN, 2005). The former consists of marble, 

calc-phyllite, calc-schist, and metaconglomerate, which have undergone amphibolite- to 

greenschist-facies metamorphism and was thrust over younger formations (TURAN; 

BINGÖL, 1991) the latter is made up of basalt, andesite, pillow lava, dacite, aplite, 

dolerite, and plutonic rocks (BINGÖL; BEYARSLAN, 1996). Both units could have been 

potential source areas for the mineralogical assemblage found in the studied section. 

Overlaying the magmatic rocks is the Harami Formation, composed of late Campanian–

Maastrichtian carbonate build-ups. Mass-flow conglomerates make up of Permo-Triassic 

Keban Metamorphic rocks and Late Cretaceous magmatic rock pebbles (AKSOY; 

TÜRKMEN; TURAN, 2005) compose the early Paleocene deposits in the basin. The 

Ku?çular and Seske Formations (late Paleocene – early Eocene) are stratigraphically 

located at the base as a sandy limestone grading up into pure limestone composed mainly 

of algae and benthic foraminifera, with a high fraction of micritic matrix (AKSOY; 

TÜRKMEN; TURAN, 2005). 

 

4. Material and Methods 

4.1 Field Sampling 

 Two field trips were made to central Turkey, the last one being in June of 2015, 

where samples were collected. An initial lithostratigraphic log was defined and the 

sedimentary succession was measured (Figure 5). Afterwards, samples were taken to the 

Istanbul Technical University (ITU), where they were cut and latter brought to Brazil.

detail of a calcarenite about 20 cm thick in the lower part of the section; e) detail of pristine gray marl 
under the detrital covering. 

4.1.1 Lithostratigraphy 

 A specific portion of the section, from 180 to 200 meters, was analyzed in closer 

detail mainly due to six strata, here named Sisters (1-6), which called the attention due 

to their thickness and location along the section. Facies description were performed 



 14 

along with thickness measurements from each layer and sampling for specific thin-

section observation.   

 

4.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) 

 X-ray diffraction has been widely used to obtain information about structures of 

crystalline materials. Normally, a powdered material is exposed to a monochromatic 

beam of X-ray, which will in turn interfere or diffract when the beam hits the crystal 

lattice. The diffraction angles will vary with the distance (d-spacing) between adjacent 

planes of atoms in the crystal. Subsequently, a distinctive diffraction pattern is generated 

for every crystalline material (e.g. minerals). These diffraction angles can be used to 

calculate the d-space (d) according to Bragg’s Law: 

                                                          ? = 2?????           (4.1)  

The wavelength of the incident beam (?) is usually fixed for most diffractometers, and ? 

represents the angle between the diffracted beam and the crystallographic plane 

(MCREYNOLDS; SKAGGS; SCHROEDER, 2008). For example, each mineral having 

its own crystalline structure, will have a different set of diffraction peaks based on their 

planes of atoms (Figure 6). Finally, by knowing the d-spacing and the diffracted patterns, 

it is possible to perform mineral identification based on comparison with standard 

materials. This technique was applied in this study to identify minerals and clay minerals 

from marlstone samples.

different peaks and a hump representing amorphous material. (modified sketch taken from Panalytical).   

4.3 Mineralogical Analyses 

A total of one hundred and twenty samples of marlstones from the Baskil Section 

were analyzed using XRD for the bulk fraction and sixty-nine samples for the clay size 

(&lt;2 µm) fraction. Measurements were made using a Panalytical X’Pert3 Pro 

diffractometer with an X’celerator detector (CuK? radiation; 45 kV; 40mA) at the United 

States Geological Survey (USGS), Santa Cruz, CA. The bulk and clay size fraction 

scanning ranges were from 3 – 70° 2q and 3 – 30° 2q, respectively, both with a step size 

of 0.03° 2q and a measuring time of 80 seconds per step. Data processing was made with 

the MacDiff 4.2.5 software (PETSCHICK, 2001). 

 

4.3.1 Bulk fraction 

Bulk rock samples were powdered with a microdrill and placed in an aluminum 

sample holder, applying gentle pressure to allow randomly oriented aggregates. All 



 16 

samples are required to have the same particle size to avoid discrepancies between 

minerals intensities, which could influence the semi-quantitative results. XRD patterns 

from randomly oriented mounts were semi-quantified according to HILLIER (2003) and 

MOORE; REYNOLDS (1997) using the integrated peak areas (IPA) of individual peaks 

by applying the following reference intensity ratios (RIR): quartz (4.26 Å) – RIR 0.91; 

albite (3.18 Å) – RIR 2.2; K-feldspar (3.24 Å) – RIR 1; phyllosilicates (4.5 Å) – RIR 

0.71; calcite (3.03 Å) – RIR 3.1; dolomite (2.88 Å) – RIR 2.7. The IPA for each mineral 

identified in every diffractogram was divided by their respective RIR to be semi-

quantified in such manner: 

Mineral weight (%) = 100* (IPA/RIR)/sum              (2) 

Mineral standards were used to test the XRD accuracy in relation to the RIR 

values and errors were calculated to be in the range of + 5% from the known amounts as 

shown in Table 1.   

Table 1: Mixtures of standard minerals with specific known values were made and calculated. An error of 
approximately + 5% was observed between known and calculated values.

4.3.2 Clay size fraction 

The first step required to analyze clay minerals is to remove all organic matter and 

calcium carbonate from the samples and afterwards separate the clay fraction (&lt;2 µm) 

from the bulk material (Table 4, Sup. Material). Not only clay minerals are found in the 

clay fraction, however, they are more easily identified and quantified when separated 

from the whole-rock. All clay mineral samples followed specific treatments described by 

(HEIN; SCHOLL; GUTMACHER, 1976; HEIN et al., 2003). Approximately 10 g of 

material were soaked in a combination of 30% ?,?, and Morgan’s solution (sodium 

acetate and glacial acidic acid) to remove organic matter and carbonates, respectively 

(Figure 7A). After the removal of organic matter and calcium carbonate, a first run in the 

centrifuged (2500 rpm for 5 minutes) was performed to separate the ?,?, and Morgan’s 

solution from the rest of the material (Figure 7B). The following step was to wash the 

samples with 2% sodium carbonate (??,??1). A magnetic stirred was used to suspend 

again the material, which was later re-concentrated into a test tube using a 0.01% Na2CO3 

to rinse any residues (Figure 7C). This material, which was suspended in the test tube 

went for a second run on the centrifuge (850 rpm for 3 minutes) (Figure 7D). After 

centrifugation, all material still in suspension had a settling diameter of 2 µm or less 

(Figure 7E).  

The &amp;lt;2 µm fraction was saved, and this process was repeated 10 times for every 

sample: re-suspending the material with 0.01% Na2CO3 and centrifuging the material 



 18 

until all the clay size fraction was extracted from every sample (Figure 7F and G). The 

clay fraction was concentrated at the bottom of the best tube through another run of the 

centrifuge (2500 rpm for 5 minutes) and washed two times with distilled water to remove 

excess salts. Finally, the clay-sized fraction was oriented on zero background holders 

prior to analyses (Figure 7H). A complete list (a step-by-step) with specific details 

regarding sample preparation follows attached at the supplementary material. 

 A set of three diffraction patterns were made for each sample, followed by air 

drying (AD), ethylene glycol solvation for 24h (EG) and heating to 375°C for 1h (H), and 

used for mineral identification and quantification purposes. Semi-quantitative estimations 

for the clay mineral abundances were based on the EG curve on specific integrated peak 

areas of individual peaks and weighting factors, following (BISCAYE, 1965). Peak 

deconvolution of peak doublets was performed for the following minerals: 

smectite/chlorite (17/14 Å), palygorskite/illite (10.5/10 Å) and kaolinite/chlorite 

(3.58/3.54 Å) (GUO; UNDERWOOD, 2011; EHRMANN et al., 2015). The same 

weighting factors used for kaolinite and chlorite was used for palygorskite (EHRMANN 

et al., 2015). Clay mineral ratios were calculated from mineral relative abundances.

fractionin the test tube, (F) clays (&lt;2µm) still in suspension, (G) clays(&lt;2µm) settled in the bottom of 
beakers, and samples already oriented on zero background holders prior to analisis.  



 20 

Illite crystallinity was measured using the full width at half maximum height 

(FWHM) and the integral breadth (I Breadth) of the 001 basal illite peak on EG samples 

as values of ?2°? (Figure 8). Both measurements presented the same trends and only the 

FWHM will be further discussed (ALIZAI et al., 2012; LIMMER et al., 2012). Low 

values indicate good crystallinity (lower weathering intensity), whereas high values 

indicate poor crystallinity (higher weathering intensity) (LAMY; HEBBELN; WEFER, 

1998; PANDARINATH, 2009). The illite chemistry was obtained from peak area ratios 

of the basal 002/001 (5 Å/ 10 Å) peaks. Ratios &gt; 0.4 correspond to Al-rich illites 

(muscovite), while ratios &amp;lt;0.15 are related to Mg and Fe-rich illites (biotite) 

(ESQUEVIN, 1969).

4.4 Benchtop X-ray (BTX) diffraction system 

The Olympus BTX II Benchtop XRD was derived by the Mars Science 

Laboratory and is an ideal equipment to perform general characterization of specific 

crystalline materials in the field and in the laboratory. This equipment has been used in 



 21 

extraterrestrial missions (e.g. Gale Crater in Mars within the Curiosity Rover) and it is 

now available for students at the Oceanographic Institute (IO-USP) ( SARRAZIN et al., 

2005; BLAKE et al., 2012). 

Key features for the BTX include a vibrating sample holder, which allow samples 

to be analyzed in a non-oriented manner, particularly well-suited for bulk mineralogy. 

This equipment was previously used in paleoclimatic studies (e.g. SAVIAN et al., 2014, 

2016), however a method is still under development to accomplish solely clay minerals 

analysis in an oriented manner. For this reason, we chose to perform our analysis using 

the Panalytical X’pert 3, even though more than 300 samples were analyzed with the 

BTX. A couple of additional results concerning the BTX will be attached in the 

supplementary material (Fig. 24, 25).  

 

4.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

Small blocks of selected marlstones samples were broken to expose a fresh 

fracture surface representative of the texture and structure of the rock (KELLER; 

REYNOLDS; INOUE, 1986). Samples were coated with Au-Pd and analyzed in a 

TESCAN VEGA3 microscope (15kV and 10nA for imaging), which included X-ray 

energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) using an Oxford Xmax 50 detector (20 s of live 

counting time). All the data were refined with the AZtech software and processed at the 

USGS, Menlo Park, CA. Additional samples were analyzed at the Institute of 

Geosciences (IGc), at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, where a LEO-440i scanning 

electron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was used, 

and samples coated with carbon.

5. Results 

5.1 Lithostratigraphy 

 The most significant lithological changes in the Baskil section are generally 

marlstones intercalated with calcarenite beds throughout the entire interval. Calcarenite 

beds had a range of ~20 cm to 1 m thick and were less frequently observed from 0 to 180 

m. After this interval, from 180 to 200 m, six strata (Sisters 1-6) in close proximity to 

each other show distinct lithological changes (Figure 9). Through the upper portion of the 

section, after the Sisters’ interval, calcarenite beds were observed more frequently.  

 

Figure 9: Detail portion of the Baskil section, from 180 to approximately 200 meters, showing changes in 
marlstones intercalated with calcarenite beds made from field observations. The age model was based on 
RODELLI et al., 2017. 

Light gray to dark gray marlstone were observed in between the Sisters, including 

a thin layer of fine sandy calcareous marl at approximately 191 m. Sisters 1 through 4 

had a similar overall texture, color and grain size. They were a mixture of carbonate and 

siliciclastic material with crossbedded lamination in the upper part of each bed (Figures 



 23 

10A,B). Grain size were slightly coarser on the bottom and became finer towards to upper 

portion of each bed (Figure 10B). Bioturbation was observed in Sister 3 (Figure 10C). A 

nummulitic marl layer with irregular thickness ranging from 1 to approximately 2 meters 

was observed bellow Sister 4 (Figures 10D, E). Small layers of nummulitic packstone 

were also observed bellow Sisters 3, 4 and 5 (Figures 10F, G). Sisters 5 had a crossbedded 

lamination in the middle portion of the bed, while Sister 6 had a more homogeneous grain 

size throughout the entire bed with a well-defined base (Figure 10H).

5.2 Mineralogy of marlstones 

Based on mineral relative abundances and temporal trends, it was possible to 

subdivide the section in three intervals (I, II, and III; Figure 11 and 12). In general, the 

silicate group minerals have a strong negative correlation with calcite, while dolomite 

occurs only as a minor component and has a different trend than calcite. Clay mineral 

suites show significant variations in the abundances of smectite and illite, while 

palygorskite appears from the middle to the uppermost interval of the section. 

 

5.2.1 Bulk mineralogy 

The bulk mineral assemblages are composed mainly of quartz, albite, K-feldspar, 

phyllosilicates, calcite and dolomite, with variable abundances throughout the section. 

The lower interval (interval I; 0 msl – 125 msl) shows generally decreasing trends for 

quartz (14% to 7%), albite (8% to 2%), and phyllosilicates (17% to 6%), as well as an 

increasing trend for calcite (60% to 78%) and decreasing trend for dolomite (10% to 4%). 

The middle interval (interval II; 125 msl – 275 msl) displays a significant shift in 

the minerals abundances. From 145 msl to 163 msl, quartz, albite, and phyllosilicates 

reach their highest contents (15%, 7%, and 31%, respectively), while calcite gets its 

minimum (44%). K-feldspar and dolomite are present only in small amounts, from ?4% 

and 1% to 4%, respectively, and show no significant changes throughout the interval. At 

233 msl all silicates decrease to their minimum (quartz is approximately 6%; albite 1%, 

K-feldspar 0%, and phyllosilicates 8%), while calcite increases up to 85%. 

For the upper section (interval III; 275 msl – 357 msl), quartz, albite, K-feldspar, 

and phyllosilicates exhibit values similar to those in the lowermost part of the section. 

However, unlike interval I, the pattern shows a tendency to increase the abundances of 

phyllosilicates, quartz, albite and notably dolomite, while calcite decreases. Quartz 



 25 

reaches up to 12%, albite up to 6% with a fairly constant trend, K-Feldspar peaks at 325 

msl with 6%, while calcite presents a decreasing trend (from 82% to 68%). Dolomite, 

which displays low values throughout most of the section, here increases from 323 msl 

to 357 msl with values up to 10%.

275-357 msl. 
 



 27 

5.2.2 Clay mineralogy 

Clay mineral assemblages are dominated by smectite and illite (&gt;75%), which 

have an inverse relationship throughout the section. In addition, palygorskite (0% to 

14%), chlorite (2% to 9%), and kaolinite (1% to 3%) are less abundant. Kaolinite has a 

mean content of approximately 2%, which shows no significant variation within the error 

of the technique (FRANKE; EHRMANN, 2010).  

A set of XRD patterns (Figure 13) characterizes the clay minerals variations 

throughout the entire section, pointing out mineralogical changes (e.g., appearance of 

palygorskite at 10.5 Å) in relation with the stratigraphic position. The lower interval 

shows smectite and illite fluctuating between 36% and 81%, and 14% and 43%, 

respectively. Palygorskite is mostly absent from this interval, with an exception at 47 msl 

(4%), while chlorite decreases slightly from about 7% to 4%. In interval II, smectite 

reaches a maximum content of 85%, while illite reaches a minimum of 6%. In this 

interval, palygorskite is found up to ~5%, while chlorite continues a decreasing trend until 

159 msl (2%) and then goes back to approximately 5%. Interval III is characterized by a 

smectite content of about 80% until 285 msl, followed by a decreasing trend to 46% at 

332 msl. In this interval, illite increases up to 34% and palygorskite reaches a maximum 

of about 15% at 319 msl, while chlorite shows no significant change. 

Illite crystallinity shows fluctuations from approximately 0.2 to 0.6 ?2°q  for the 

entire section. Good crystallinity (lower values, less altered) is observed in interval I with 

values close to 0.2 ?2°q (Figure 12). Values begin to increase at ~130 msl (interval II) 

with values of 0.32 and 0.44 ?2°q. The uppermost interval (interval III) shows poor 

crystallinity (higher values, more altered) with values higher than 0.5 ?2°q above 325 

msl. The illite chemistry, based on the 5/10 Å peak area ratio, has a mean value of 0.65 

cps.

intervals. Changes in illite crystallinity and the appearance of palygorskite are evident when comparing 
interval I to interval III. 

Thus, the illites are more Al-rich and Mg- and Fe-poor, proximal to the composition of 

the muscovite. Only in the last few meters of the section, from 332 msl to 353 msl, values 

decrease to about 0.2, possibly showing a more biotite rich composition (Figure 23, Sup. 

Material). 

Clay mineral ratios were applied to highlight potential environmental changes 

(LIMMER et al., 2012; PAYROS et al., 2015). These ratios include smectite/chlorite and 

(smectite+kaolinite)/(illite+chlorite), as (ChW/PhW), in a logarithmic scale to show 

changes from chemical to physical weathering (Figure 14). There is a significant change 

at approximately 125 msl, which is the beginning of interval II, where the 



 30 

smectite/chlorite ratio increases significantly (~40%) when compared to the lower 

interval. The (ChW)/(PhW) decreases from 0% to -1%, at the same interval. However, 

towards the top of the section smectite/chlorite ratio follows a decreasing trend, while the 

ChW/ PhW remains steady until 275 msl, and then increases back to ~0%. Another typical 

clay parameter was the palygorskite/illite ratio (KOLLA et al., 1976; FAGEL et al., 1992) 

used to highlight palygorskite abundancy through the studied interval.

5.3 SEM 

Under SEM, the marlstones showed to be generally well lithified. Clay minerals 

occur mainly as an abundant matrix in which detrital grains of quartz or feldspar are 

immersed. (Figure 15A). A high abundance of smectite was observed showing an angular 

outline with a sometimes broken and deformed platy morphology, indicating detrital 

origin (Fig. 15B, C). No signs of authigenic platy clay minerals were found. Fibrous clays 

were also observed in interval III (Figure 15E, F). EDS analyses showed the presence of 

Si, Al, Mg and Fe, and traces of Ca and K, in agreement with the chemical composition 



 31 

of palygorskite (EDS). Dolomite appeared in the uppermost part of the section with a 

rhombohedral shape (Figure 15F) followed by EDS analysis (Figure 16).

6. Interpretation and discussion 

6.1 Lithostratigraphy 

 Calcarenite beds in the Baskil section are most likely related to mass movement 

events, in which an instability elsewhere at shallower depths allowed this material to be 

deposited at a slope environment. By looking at the field observations and considering 

the geology from the area, such instability was probably generated either through sea-

level variations and/or due to an active tectonic regime.  

 Previous studies have related mass movement events, including turbidite 

sedimentation in  slope basin, with sea-level changes, climate and tectonics (e.g. ?PRINS; 

POSTMA, 2000). Even though there is no sea-level curve for the Baskil section, 

sedimentation rates were decreasing (Figure 17) towards the uppermost part of the section 

(from 180 to 300 meters) as calcarenites were being deposited more frequently. This 

could indicate that after 180 meters (~ 40 Ma) the tectonic regime became more active. 



 33 

 

Figure 17: Sedimentation rates from the Baskil section (after RODELLI et al., 2017) 

 Thin-sections of the Sister beds were analyzed and they contained significant 

amounts of fossilized organisms (e.g. nummulites) among detrital grains (Figure 18). In 

addition, the presence of glauconite was observed throughout these strata (figure 18B, 

C, F). The formation of glauconite usually takes place in shallow-marine shelf locations 

with low sedimentation rates (BALDERMANN et al., 2013). The presence of the green 

mineral shows that the carbonates and siliciclastic material composing the Sisters was 

coming from a shallower platform, in which sedimentation rates were low.  Moreover, 

other studies have related the process of glauconitization during periods of sea-level 

transgressions (LI et al., 2012). More work is still required in all calcarenite beds 

throughout the studied section, including detailed work of facies description and thin-

sections, in order to obtain a conclusive result regarding the origin and forcing 

mechanisms related to the calcarenite deposition.

6.2 Origin of clay- and non-clay minerals in the Baskil section  

The Baskil section is characterized by two main lithologies: monotonous 

hemipelagic marlstones and calcarenite beds. Mineralogical variations do not reflect 

different rock types, since the lithological parameter is fixed and only marlstones were 



 35 

analyzed. Therefore, the main processes controlling the mineralogical input and clay 

mineral assemblages are the composition of the source area, types of weathering of the 

source rocks (climate related), and offshore current patterns (FRANKE; EHRMANN, 

2010). 

Due to the fact that clay minerals in sedimentary rocks can be either detrital or 

authigenic, it is thus crucial to determine their origin before using them as proxies for 

environmental and/or geochemical conditions in which they formed (THIRY, 2000). 

Detrital clay minerals refer to inherited minerals, either from rocks (parent material) or 

soils developed on parent material by weathering (HILLIER, 1995). On the other hand, 

authigenic minerals form (a) by in situ precipitation from solution, or (b) by diagenetic 

alteration, or (c) by replacement of pre-existing phases within the sediment column in the 

depositional basin. 

In the context of the Baskill section, palygorskite is considered to have an 

authigenic origin, which will be further discussed. The occurrence of other authigenic 

minerals was discarded mainly due to observations through SEM, which indicated detrital 

characteristics and no signs of diagenesis. Additionally, sedimentary deposit thickness 

did not exceed 2 km, which could also induce a diagenetic imprint ( CHAMLEY, 1989; 

BOLLE, M.; ADATTE, 2001; CHEN et al., 2016). Despite the active tectonics in the 

region, the Baskil succession is tectonically undisturbed, with very little post-depositional 

alteration (RODELLI et al., 2017). Therefore, except for palygorskite, the clay mineral 

variations in this section can be interpreted as from the weathering of continental rocks 

and soils that were later transported into the marine depositional basin. As the entire 

section represents approximately 4 Myr of deposition (RODELLI et al., 2017), soils 

would have been able to develop and reflect the weathering and climatic changing 



 36 

conditions on the continent as they altered through that period of time (THIRY; DUPUIS, 

2000). 

Smectite and illite are the most abundant clay minerals in the studied section and 

show a coeval and inverse relationship because of their different mechanisms of 

formation and environmental conditions under which they form. Smectite usually forms 

as weathering product in poorly drained soils with slow moving water, high pH, high 

silica activity, and abundance of cations (GALÁN, 2006). These soils form under warm 

and humid conditions with highly seasonality with contrasting dry and wet phases 

(CHAMLEY, 1989; ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1991). The Late Cretaceous magmatic 

complex could be a potential source for smectite as it is commonly derived from the 

alteration of volcanic rocks. On the other hand, illite and chlorite are commonly products 

of physical erosion of low-grade metamorphic rocks, such as the Permo-Triassic 

metamorphic rocks, with little chemical weathering (ALIZAI et al., 2012). Kaolinite is 

not abundant in the section, which is expected since conditions for its formation are quite 

different than for the other clay minerals: very humid and warm, pervasively weathered 

and leached soil profiles. 

The trend of the phyllosilicate’s group parallels those of quartz throughout the 

studied succession, suggesting a common detrital origin. Conversely, calcite derives 

mainly from biogenic micrite, and thus has an inverse relationship with the silicate 

minerals. This relationship can be explained by reciprocal dilution between the 

terrigenous and the carbonate fractions. K-feldspar is present only in small concentrations 

with a mean value of 0.763 %, which is not significant for our discussion. The evolving 

trends of clay- and non-clay minerals are discussed below, highlighting potential source 

areas and environmental factors influencing assemblage variations.  

Interval I, 0 – 125 msl, Lutetian – Bartonian 



 37 

 This interval is characterized by higher contents of illite and chlorite, and lower 

sedimentation rates (RODELLI et al., 2017). In the lowest part (0 – 45 msl) well-

crystalized illite (mica) increases from 30% to 50% and chlorite from 7% to 9% (Figure 

12). This indicates the Permo-Triassic metamorphic complex as the potential source area 

with a predominantly mechanical weathering regime. Quartz and albite show a decreasing 

trend, while calcite slightly increases. Dolomite appears more significantly in the lowest 

part of the section without the presence of palygorskite, indicating a possible detrital 

origin for the Mg-carbonate. The concentration of both illite and chlorite decrease 

towards the end of this interval, while smectite increases. This may reflect changes in the 

source area from a metamorphic to a volcanic source, in combination with a transitional 

change from physical to chemical weathering. 

Interval II, 125 – 275 msl, Bartonian 

 The middle portion of the section is characterized by clay mineral assemblages 

dominated by smectite (83%), over illite (10%) and chlorite (2%). This indicates a change 

from physical to persistent and pervasive chemical weathering conditions on the 

continent, where the magmatic complex was the primary source for the smectite. Warmer 

temperatures and humid conditions contrasting with dryer periods are likely to have 

occurred, which is shown by the increase in poorly crystalline illite (0.45 2q). Higher 

sedimentation rates prevailed until ~170 m (RODELLI et al, 2017) and started to decrease 

afterwards, followed by the appearance of palygorskite (Figure 12). Other silicate 

minerals such as quartz (16%), albite (8%), and phyllosilicates combined (35%) increased 

significantly from ~145 msl to 170 msl, while calcite (43%) decreases. This indicates an 

intensification in terrigenous input being deposited into the sedimentary basin resulting 

in a dilution effect of the carbonate materials. This particular interval coincides with the 

lowest concentration of calcite and dolomite.  



 38 

 The mineralogical assemblages above 170 msl begins to shift gradually to a calcite 

dominated period (85% at ~ 275 msl) while detrital minerals such as quartz (4%), albite 

(1%) and phyllosilicates (10%) decrease significantly. This biogenic carbonate 

“recovery” period can be interpreted as related to dryer environmental continental 

conditions, which caused a gradual decrease in the amount of material coming from the 

surrounding land and lower sedimentation rates. This is also indicated by the relatively 

small variations in smectite (~70 – 80%), illite (~8 – 15%), and chlorite (~3 – 5%), and 

by the concomitant presence of palygorskite (~1 – 6%). Dolomite maintained a relatively 

low concentration throughout the interval indicating not favorable conditions for its 

precipitation (authigenic) or no important input from a shallower carbonate environment 

(detrital). 

 To summarize, the mineral and clay mineral assemblages of interval II indicate 

enhanced chemical weathering, with relatively humid conditions and increasing 

terrigenous input into the sedimentary basin, which culminated in the beginning of 

interval II (125 – 170 msl). In the upper part of this interval (170 – 275 msl), the 

conditions started to change gradually towards drier and with less chemical weathering. 

Interval III, 275 – 357 msl, Bartonian – Priabonian 

 The uppermost interval of the section is marked by a decrease in smectite (84 – 

49%), increase in illite (5 – 34%), and increase in palygorskite (4 – 15%), suggesting: (1) 

change in the source area from igneous rocks back to the metamorphic complex, (2) less 

intense chemical weathering, and (3) changes in the water column chemistry. This clay 

mineral assemblage reflects source area conditions similar to those that characterize 

interval I. However, the illite crystallinity index is much higher (0.6 2-theta) than in 

interval I (0.2 2-theta), indicating that illite was altered in the terrestrial environment 

during deposition of interval II, and was then transported and deposited in the depositional 



 39 

basin when sources changed back from igneous to metamorphic rocks. Additionally, the 

combination of higher content of palygorskite (15%), the increase in dolomite (10%), and 

low sedimentation rates points to a Mg-richer environment, probably with warmer and 

more saline bottom water condition (THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). 

As mentioned above, the palygorskite found in the Baskil section is interpreted to 

have formed in situ, which most likely precipitated in the pore spaces of near-surface 

sediments (Figure 15D,E). Indeed, it is highly unlikely that small delicate fibers (~1 µm) 

were reworked from land or shallow-water environments and transported to the 

depositional basin at water depths of ~300 to 600 m (RODELLI et al., 2017). Authigenic 

palygorskite has been observed in deep-sea sediments and it has been proposed to have 

required changes at the seabed and in the water column, such as reduced sedimentation 

rates, elevated ambient temperature, and high Mg and Si concentrations (PLETSCH, 

1998, 2001; THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). These conditions are similar to the ones required 

for the formation of authigenic/diagenetic dolomite, which also indicate a magnesium-

rich environment (CHAHI; DUPLAY; LUCAS, 1993; THIRY; JACQUIN, 1993; 

THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011); dolomite and palygorskite occur together in the uppermost 

interval (interval III) of the Baskil section, and thus the environmental conditions 

proposed for their formation were likely extant in the Elazig basin.  

Previous work invoked the possibility of elevated deep-sea temperatures, salinity, 

and magnesium- and silica-rich waters to account for the formation of authigenic 

palygorskite during the lower Eocene (PLETSCH, 1998, 2001; SHOVAL, 2004). Since 

the possibility of detrital palygorskite was unlikely, the conditions in the water column 

must have changed. Magnesium could have been supplied by saline bottom water, 

perhaps fed from an evaporative platform, allowing the formation of palygorskite and 

dolomite (THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). Evidence of such an evaporative environment in 



 40 

central Turkey is marked by the occurrence of marine palygorskite, which appears in 

evaporative deposits spanning the Paleocene and Eocene within three other sedimentary 

basins (e.g. Sivas, Hekimhan and Darende basin) in relatively close proximity to the 

Elazig basin, where the Baskil section lies (PALMER; HELVACÍ; FALLICK, 2004; 

YALÇIN; BOZKAYA, 1995, 2011; BOOTH et al., 2014). 

The combination of leaching of lightly increased amounts of silicate minerals with 

the increase in magnesium being fed from shallower environments, and an additional 

increase in temperature and salinity could have provided the necessary conditions for the 

formation of the fibrous clay minerals. Changes in ocean circulation, including 

stratification of the water column, have been noted for warmer periods on Earth from the 

Late Cretaceous to the Eocene (BRASS; SOUTHAM; PETERSON, 1982; MILLER, 

1992; KROON et al., 2000; PAK; SHOVAL, 2004; THIRY; PLETSCH, 2011). Here we 

suggest that a stratified water column occurred in the Baskil section due to changes in 

circulation, which allowed conditions for the formation of authigenic palygorskite 

accompanied by dolomite in a Mg- and Si-rich environment under low sedimentation 

rates. 

 The clay mineral assemblages in interval III can be attributed to various processes. 

(1) There was a change in source area that provided more weathered illite, previously 

developed, and then (2) less intense chemical weathering on the continent. (3) Enhanced 

stratification of the water column may have been caused by changes in ocean circulation, 

in combination with dryer and more evaporative conditions on the adjacent land and 

shallower marine environments, and with lower sedimentation rates. These conditions 

would have promoted warmer and saline bottom water, rich in magnesium, favorable for 

palygorskite and dolomite formation in the deeper-water depositional basin. (4) A sea-

level retreat occurred in the Neo-Tethys from approximately 41 Myr ago until the Eocene-



 41 

Oligocene boundary ( MILLER, 2005; BOSBOOM et al., 2011; WANG et al., 2013b ; 

BOSBOOM; GUO, 2014). This exposed, reworked, and transported material from a 

shallower continental margin to a deeper basin was not enough to increase sedimentation 

rates but could explain the small increase in silicate minerals.   

 

6.3 A mineralogical evidence of the MECO in the Baskil section? 

 Our well-dated succession can be used to correlate the mineralogical variations to 

global climatic changes known to have occurred during the middle Eocene. The global 

warming event that took place during the middle Eocene, also known as MECO, occurred 

at approximately 40.5 Myr ago and lasted for almost 500 ka (BOHATY; ZACHOS, 2003; 

BOHATY et al., 2009). Despite its clear stable isotopic signature, which was found in the 

Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans (BOHATY et al., 2009; EDGAR et al., 2010; 

PASCHER et al., 2015), as well as in the Tethys (JOVANE et al., 2007; LUCIANI et al., 

2010; SPOFFORTH et al., 2010; DAWBER et al., 2011; Savian et al., 2014), the climatic 

mechanism responsible for this event are still not well understood. Computer model 

projections, when compared to observed data, fail to explain the long duration of the 

warming conditions, as well as their abrupt end (SLUIJS et al., 2013).  

 In the Baskil section, the 40.5 to ~40 Ma interval ranges from a depth of 125 msl 

to 163 msl and is clearly marked by increase in smectite (&gt;80%), decrease in illite (&lt;10%) 

and palygorskite starts to appear more significantly during and after the event (Figure 12, 

19). Additionaly, the clear oxygen isotope (?18O) excursion from benthic and planktonic 

foraminifera (GIORGIONI, in prep) confirms the mineralogical signature of the event 

(Figure 19). This shift to smectite as the dominant clay mineral not only indicates a 

potential change in source area characterized by volcanic material, but also a climatic 

change, where warmer conditions with moderate humidity would favor smectite 



 42 

formation and deposition prior to the MECO peak warming. Furthermore, the appearance 

of authigenic palygorskite, shown with palygorskite/illite ratio, is suggested to be product 

of changes in the water column possibly related to changes in circulation patterns. The 

increase in palygorskite is concomitant with the global warming event (Figure 19). A 

divergence between the  d18O curves of the shallow- and deep-water dwelling planktonic 

foraminifera after the event suggests a more stratified water column in the Neo-Tethys.  

 
Figure 19: Clay mineral ratios and stable oxygen isotopes from planktonic and benthic foraminifera 
(Giorgioni, in prep.) marking the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) in the Baskil section. 

 
Clay minerals have been used to identify warmer/cooler periods such as the 

PETM, the EECO, and the Eocene/Oligocene transition. For example, the increase in 

kaolinite content indicates warmer and humid conditions during the PETM at many 

locations, such as North and South Atlantic, Antarctica, New Zealand, China, Egypt, 

Israel, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Spain, and England (ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1991; 



 43 

ROBERT; KENNET, 1994; KAIKO et al., 1996; GAWENDA et al., 1999; GIBSON; 

BYBELL; MASON, 2000; ERNST et al., 2006; SCHULTE; SCHEIBNER; SPEIJER, 

2011; SOLIMAN et al., 2011; JOHN et al., 2012; BORNEMANN et al., 2014; 

PUJALTE; BACETA; SCHMITZ, 2015; CHEN et al., 2016; KEMP et al., 2016). The 

EECO proxies were identified in the western Pyrenees and in China, also with an increase 

in kaolinite, however towards the end of the period, dryer conditions may have prevailed 

( WANG et al., 2013a; PAYROS et al., 2015). The Eocene/Oligocene transition, 

characterized by cooling climate, is marked by a decrease in kaolinite and smectite and a 

corresponding increase in illite and chlorite (EHRMANN; MACKENSEN, 1992; 

DIESTER-HAAS; ROBERT; CHAMLEY, 1996; WANG et al., 2013a; ZHANG; GUO, 

2014). The MECO, however, has only been mineralogically characterized at Monte 

Cagnero (MCA, Italy) and in the western Indian Ocean (ODP Site 711), where an increase 

in smectite content has been observed associated with the warming phase (SAVIAN et 

al., 2014, 2016). The same samples from the Indian Ocean (ODP Site 711) were analyzed 

with the methods used for this study. The results showed consistency, where smectite 

increases during the MECO, even though calcite was removed through sample 

preaparation and only insignificant amount of quartz was present in the less then 2 µm 

(Figure 20). 



 44 

 

Figure 20: Increase in smectite integrated peak area and percentage during the MECO interval (after SAVIAN et al., 
2016). 

 The increase in smectite in the Baskil section is well dated at ~40.5 Ma, based on 

the age model of RODELLI et al. (2017), and thus may be related to the changing climatic 

conditions during the MECO. Moreover, this is the first evidence of palygorskite 

appearance during the event. Clay mineral ratios were employed to correlate major 

changes during the warming periods. Chemically weathered produced smectite and 

kaolinite contrasts with physically eroded illite and chlorite, providing a proxy for 

chemical weathering, which in turns also shows warmer climate (LIMMER et al., 2012; 

PAYROS et al., 2015) (Figure 21).  

  Even though records expressing continental conditions during the MECO are still 

scarce, previous studies have shown warm and semi-arid to sub-humid conditions in 

western North America (METHNER et al., 2016) followed by aridification (BOSBOOM 

et al., 2014). This is consistent with our results showing an increase in smectite and 

decrease in illite and chlorite, which indicate warmer conditions. Moreover, this clay 

mineral assemblage is maintained until ~275 msl (38.5 Myr ago), with the additional 

increasing trend of authigenic palygorskite. This indicates that chemical weathering 



 45 

conditions predominated in the Baskil region also after the MECO, accompanied by dryer 

periods and paleoceanographic changes. Further work is necessary to verify the 

relationship between the MECO and the paleoceanographic evolution of the region. 

However, this is the first study showing a possible change in the water column right after 

the MECO event in the Neo-Tethys and coincides with previous works showing dryer 

conditions after the event. 

 
Figure 21: Clay mineral ratios showing that warmer conditions were maintained after the warming event 
with chemical weathering (ChW) regime on land until approximately 38.5 Ma.  

7. Conclusions 

This study shows that non-clay and clay minerals variations along a well-

preserved sedimentary section provide reliable proxies for detrital source areas and 

weathering regimes. Moreover, the appearance of authigenic minerals were used as an 

indicator of changes in the water column conditions, which was the first occurrence 

registered during a global warming period. The dominant condition of abundant well-



 46 

crystallized illite in the lowermost interval of the studied section (interval I) changed 

gradually to a smectite dominant interval (interval II), coinciding with the onset of  the 

Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. This is interpreted as from a change in source area, 

from a metamorphic to magmatic rocks, in combination with changes from physical to 

chemical weathering. Additionally, increasing sedimentation rates indicate increased 

erosion from a warmer and more humid climate on land at the beginning of interval II. 

The smectite content slightly decreased after 40 Ma, but its dominance was maintained 

until 38.5 Ma. In addition, the uppermost interval (interval III) shows lower sedimentation 

rates, slight increase of silicates, accompanied by increase in weathered illite and 

especially palygorskite and dolomite. This indicates a change in the source area providing 

previously weathered illite, and changes in the water column that favored the formation 

of palygorskite and dolomite. The hypothesis tested was supported by the data, which 

showed an increase in smectite during a warmer period. The mineralogical evolution of 

the Baskil section reflects how source-areas and weathering regimes changed through 

time on land, how environmental changes occurred concomitantly on the continent and 

in a restricted ocean, and how these changes can be related to global (i.e. MECO) and/or 

local to regional processes (Figure 22).

Preparation of Samples for X-ray Diffraction Analysis of Clay Minerals  
 

General 
 
Use distilled or deionized water for mixing chemicals and in all steps of this procedure. 
Number samples, beakers, test tubes and corresponding slots on centrifuge. 
Always balance test tubes in centrifuge.   
 
Chemicals Needed 
 
Morgan’s Solution – 82 g sodium acetate plus 27 ml glacial acetic acid, diluted to 1 
liter. 
 
30% Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) 
 
2% Sodium Carbonate – 20 g Na2CO3, diluted to 1 liter 
 
0.01% Sodium Carbonate – 0.1 g Na2CO3 diluted to 1 liter  OR Use 5 ml of the 2% 
Na2CO3, add to 1 liter of water 
 
1 M Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate (MgCl2•6H2O) – 203.3 g MgCl2•6H2O diluted 
to 1 liter 
 
Ethylene Glycol 
 
If testing for vermiculite (Ba-saturation):  1 M Ba Cl2 – 244.3 g BaCl2, diluted to 1 liter 
 
 
Equipment Needed 
 
Beakers – (1) 250 ml and (1) 1000 ml or larger per sample 
 
Test tubes – (1) 50 ml plastic tube per sample 
 
Squirt bottles – Five total: (1) Morgan’s Solution; (1) 2% Na2CO3; (1) 0.01% Na2CO3; 
(1) MgCl2; and (1) distilled water 
 
Magnetic stirrer and magnets 
 
Desiccator – be sure the desiccant is fresh (i.e. dry, the blue indicator should not be 
purple) and the lids are greased.  If desiccant is purple (saturated), see “Desiccant in 
desiccator” procedure

CLAY MINERALOGY PROCEDURE 
 

1. Remove organic matter (OM) and CaCO3 from sample by adding the following 
chemicals per 10 cc of sediment: 

• 50 ml water 
• 20 ml H2O2 
• 20 ml Morgan’s Solution 

 
Stir and let sit for 4 to 5 days (depending on the amount of OM and CaCO3  
 
If a lot of organic matter or CaCO3 is present, the mixture will bubble.  If a vigorous 
reaction is observed, double the amount of Hydrogen Peroxide and Morgan’s 
solution after the reaction has quieted.  If it still reacts after several hours, add more 
H2O2 and Morgan’s Solution (always together as the Morgan’s Solution acts as a 
buffer) in increments of 10 ml each every 3 hours until reaction is complete. 

 
2. After 2 days, transfer sample solution to centrifuge tube in the following manner: 
 • fill test-tube with sample solution, centrifuge 5 min. @ 1000-1500 rpm 
 • pour off clear liquid and add more solution 
 • when all of the sample is concentrated at the bottom of the tube and the last of the 

liquid is discarded, then wash the sample 
 • use a squeeze bottle to squirt Morgan’s Solution hard enough to suspend all 

sediment (or stir with plastic stirrer making sure to wash the sediment off the stirrer 
back into the test tube) 

 • centrifuge for 5 minutes @ 1000-1500 rpm and pour off liquid 
 • do this twice 
 
3. Wash sample into a beaker using 50 ml 2% Na2CO3 

• cover with a watch glass and stir with magnetic stirrer for 5 min. at the highest 
speed magnet will allow (the highest speed at which the vortex created is preserved) 

 • re-concentrate all sample in test tube (as above) using 0.01% Na2CO3 to rinse 
residue in beaker into tube 

 
4. Thoroughly suspend sediment in tubes with 0.01% Na2CO3 

• centrifuge for 3 min. at 850 rpm (set time so that the centrifuge spins for 3 min at 
850 rpm, it may take 25 sec to get to 850 rpm);  
• all material still in suspension has a settling diameter of 2 µm or less 
• pour off suspension into large beaker and save 
• the sediment is again suspended (using 0.01% Na2CO3), centrifuged again, and the 
supernatant is poured into the same appropriate large beaker 
• begin with different tube from centrifuge each time you suspend the clay, because 
the sediment settles slightly while you re-suspend the other samples 

 • repeat until supernatant is clear 
 • if after 10 runs the supernatant isn’t clear, it probably contains colloidal material, 

so stop 
• save silt and sand concentrated in the test tube in a plastic bottle and put aside 

 • wash out test tube 
 • concentrate (as in #2) the suspended clay (from large beaker) back into test tube

5.  Mg saturate the clay by washing (as in #2) 4 times with MgCl2 (1000-1500 rpm for 5 
min.); discard the liquid 
 
6. Remove excess salts by washing clay (as in #2) 2 times with distilled water (1000-
1500 rpm for 5 min.); discard the liquid 
 
7. Spread clay evenly over a plastic or glass insert in the aluminum holder, layer should 

be nearly translucent when held up to the light 
 
8. Glycolate slides: 
 • place aluminum holder with clay on a “holy” plate or screen over a bowl of ethylene 

glycol 
 • put this in an oven at 65°C for 1-4 hours 
 • remove from oven and place glycol/holy plate/sample set up in a dessicator for 18-24 

hours. This expands the smectite lattice so that smectite can be distinguished from 
chlorite and vermiculite. 

 
9. Samples are now ready to x-ray using the Clay Min program in the XRD data 

collector, which will run the samples from 3°-35° 2Ø at 40 kV and 45 mA and again 
from 24°-26° 2Ø at a slower speed 

 
10. After step #7, if vermiculite is suspected (6.2° 2ø peak is greater than the 12.4° 2ø 

peak), take a  split of the clay sample (before glycolation) for Ba-saturation 
    • follow through steps #5 and #6, using BaCl2 instead of MgCl2 
    • x-ray Ba-saturated slide, DON’T GLYCOLATE
