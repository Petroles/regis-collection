resumo	A presente dissertação tem como objetivo contribuir para o aumento do conhecimento do comportamento estrutural de perfis em aço enformados a frio em situação de incêndio. A aplicação destes elementos, com secções transversais de paredes finas, é cada vez mais comum mantendo uma significativa capacidade de suporte de cargas. Estas secções transversais esbeltas proporcionam uma maior suscetibilidade à ocorrência de fenómenos de instabilidade local nos respetivos perfis enformados a frio. Adicionalmente, a instabilidade global dos elementos e a encurvadura distorcional relacionada com a existência de reforços na secção são também modos de colapso muito comuns nestes perfis. Estes fenómenos de instabilidade são intensificados quando os perfis estão sujeitos a elevadas temperaturas, tais como as que ocorrem em caso de incêndio. O presente estudo, que se foca na determinação das capacidades resistentes últimas de colunas, vigas e vigas-coluna em aço enformados a frio a altas temperaturas, é baseado em análises numéricas não lineares com imperfeições, aplicando o programa de elementos finitos SAFIR. Com o intuito de validar os diferentes modelos numéricos aplicados, foram analisados numericamente ensaios experimentais da literatura a diferentes perfis enformados a frio à temperatura normal e a elevadas temperaturas. Posteriormente foi realizado um estudo paramétrico para compreensão da influência de diferentes parâmetros para aferição dos modelos numéricos (como as imperfeições geométricas iniciais, as tensões residuais e os cantos com resistência aumentada) e para estabelecimento de casos de estudo, a considerar na validação de propostas de dimensionamento de colunas, vigas e vigas-coluna em aço enformados a frio. Através dos estudos paramétricos concretizados variando esbeltezas de secções, temperaturas, tipos de aço e tipos de carregamento, as cargas últimas obtidas numericamente são comparadas com as resistências fornecidas pelas prescrições do Eurocódigo 3, para estes perfis. E por fim, seguindo as observações obtidas com as referidas comparações, são propostas novas formulações de cálculo que melhoram a previsão analítica dos diferentes elementos estruturais a altas temperaturas.

abstract	This thesis has the objective to contribute to increase the knowledge on the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel profiles in case of fire. These elements application, with thin-walled sections, is increasingly while maintaining a significant load bearing capacity. These slender cross-sections provide greater susceptibility to the occurrence of local instability phenomena in the respective cold-formed profiles. Additionally, the global instability of the elements and the distortional buckling related to the existing of reinforcements in the section are also very common collapse modes in these profiles. These instability phenomena are intensified when the profiles are subjected to high temperatures, such as the ones in case of fire. The present study, which focuses on the determination of the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel columns, beams and beam-columns at high temperatures, is based on non-linear numerical analyses with imperfections, using the finite element software SAFIR. In order to validate the different numerical models applied, numerical analysis of different cold-formed profiles experimental tests at normal and high temperatures was performed. Subsequently, a parametric study was carried out to understand the influence of different parameters for numerical modelling (such as initial imperfections, residual stresses and the corner enhancements) and to stablish case studies to be considered in the validation of cold-formed steel columns, beams and beam-columns design proposals. Through the parametric studies performed varying the cross-sections slendernesses, temperatures, steel grades and loading types, the ultimate loads numerically obtained are compared with the resistances provided by Eurocode 3 prescriptions, for these profiles. And finally, following the observations obtained with such comparisons, new design formulations are proposed that improve the analytical predictions of the different structural elements at high temperatures.
For every problem there’s a challenge, for every challenge there’s a solution.

1.1	General considerations
The cold-formed steel profiles can be applied to almost all existing buildings typologies. The use of these profiles in construction began around 1850 in the United States and United Kingdom, but the biggest application on residential construction began at the end of the Second World War, in Japan, due to the mass destruction and lack of wood to build new habitational buildings (Silvestre et al., 2013). The cross-section geometry is very often conditioned by the intended application, which leads to a large variety of cross-sections shapes and sizes (Figure 1.1). Most common cold-formed steel profiles cross-sections geometry are C, Z, S and Q.
Figure 1.1 - Most common section types according to their application, for columns and beams
The cold-formed profiles are commonly used in buildings due to its lightness and ability to support large spans, being quite common as roof or walls support elements (Silvestre and Camotim, 2010a).
Some of general advantages provided by cold-formed steel structural members in building constructions are (Yu, 2000): the lightness; the ability to support large spans; the high strength and stiffness; the faster manufacturing process and with relatively light loads; the easy prefabrication and mass production; the favourable strength-to-weight ratios; the cross-section’s shape allowing the compact packaging; the economy in transportation, handling and the sustainability on construction (Silvestre et al., 2013). Compared with other materials, the combination of previous qualities can result in cost saving in construction.
On the other hand, the structural steel elements with thin-walled sections are characterized by being able to have the possibility of failure modes occurrence such as
local, distortional and global (for example, lateral-torsional buckling on elements under bending and flexural buckling on elements under compression). The instability phenomena and its influence on the ultimate strength at normal temperature have been widely studied (Gonçalves and Camotim, 2007; Silvestre and Camotim, 2010b).
However, cold-formed steel elements behaviour in fire has only recently received the same attention. In fact, the fire resistance evaluation of cold-formed profiles has a major role in the design of these elements. According to Sidey and Teague (1988), the cold-formed steel strength can suffer a reduction of 10 to 20% more than that for hot rolled steels due to the metallurgical composition. For high temperatures, cold-formed steel profiles are likely to lose the strength that they gained through manufacturing process at normal temperature. For these reasons, there are differences between the degradation characteristics of mechanical properties of hot-rolled and cold-formed steels at elevated temperatures. The French National Annex (FN Annex) from Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 (EC3) (CEN, 2007) recommends appropriate reduction factors for hot-rolled and cold-formed steel profiles with Class 4 cross-sections at high temperatures.
Figure 1.2 shows an example of the effect of a fire in a building with cold-formed profiles applied as roof support elements.
Figure 1.2 - Cold-formed profiles as roof support elements after a fire on Vagos, Portugal, 2017
The fire resistance analysis of these elements can be performed using calculation methods with various complexity levels, ranging from those based on simplified methods defined in the Eurocodes, to more complex ones with non-linear analysis, based on the finite element method and included in the designated advanced calculation methods. To better capture local instabilities, the resistance of building structures with thin-walled profiles has been calculated using advanced methods with finite shell elements.
This thesis presents a research on the behaviour of cold-formed steel members (beams, columns and beam-columns) under fire situation based on numerical analysis. Numerical models are developed and validated against experimental tests from literature. After an extensive study about these profiles under the influence of different considered parameters, proposals for new design formulae are made.
1.2	Contextualization of the thesis topic
In 1729, Van Musschenbroek started the first experiments of centrally compressed prismatic bars and, as a conclusion, he presented an empirical formula for column strength depending on column length, where the buckling load was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the column (Timoshenko and Gere, 2012).
Thirty years later, at 1759, Euler obtained the mathematical analysis for this empirical formula. According to this research, the column behaviour is analysed by using the linear theory based on linear elastic material property and small deflection approximation of the element. A straight column (considered as a perfect column) remains straight from the beginning of loading process and to produce a small deflection on the column the load must reach a critical value. Below this critical load, the column would not suffer any deflection, as it is explained on Chapter 2 of this document.
However, the previous theories were not accepted by engineers until 1846, when Lamarle gave a logical explanation to the discrepancy between Euler's and Musschenbroek's theories. If the fundamental assumptions of the perfect material elasticity and under ideal conditions at the ends were satisfied, the Euler's theory is in agreement with the Musschenbroek's results (Timoshenko and Gere, 2012).
Von Karman (1908, 1910) and Chwalla (1928) started plastic studies of beam-columns. At 1932, Von Karman proposes the Effective Length Method, which is still a current method applied on post-buckling analysis (Chen and Atsuta, 2007).
George Winter and his collaborators, since 1939, started an investigation on structural behaviour of cold-formed steel structures conducted at Cornell University resulting in the development of many works about design methods considering the effective width method for stiffened compression elements, web crippling of thin-walled sections,
beams lateral buckling, flexural buckling of thin-walled steel columns, flexural-torsional buckling of concentrically and eccentrically loaded columns (beam-columns) in the elastic and inelastic ranges, as well as the effects of manufacturing processes on material properties (occurrence of residual stresses). Thus, Winter became known as “the father” of cold-formed steel leading this effort until his retirement in 1975 (Yu and LaBoube, 2010).
Takahashi and Mizuno (1978) publish a paper describing the distortional instability phenomenon that can occur on thin-walled open sections. The range of the other buckling modes (local and flexural-torsional) in a lipped channel cross-section column were presented by Hancock (1984). Years later, Lau and Hancock (1990) developed simple analytical expressions to allow the distortional buckling stress to be calculated for different dimensions of thin-walled lipped channel columns cross-sections. Kwon and Hancock (1992) studied lipped channel cross-sections (with and without stiffeners) under fixed boundary conditions, choosing also a particular yield strength to ensure that a substantial post-buckling strength reserve occurs in a cross-section distortional mode. According to Serrette and Pekoz (1995) the distortional buckling has an important role on flexural members or decking sections behaviour.
Davies and Jiang (1996) applied the Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) to analyse the individual buckling modes separately and combined. Applying the same theory, Silvestre and Camotim (2002) described and discussed the various steps involved in deriving analytical distortional buckling formulae for cold-formed steel lipped channel elements, and Narayanan and Mahendran (2003) studied the distortional buckling strength for more complex cross-section geometries.
One of the first studies of residual stresses, on cold-formed steel elements, was published by Ingvarsson (1978) for columns with two channel cross-sections welded together and by Weng and Pekoz (1988b) for cold-formed steel channel sections. Relevant studies on residual stresses were also presented by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a).
On 1998, the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) starts developing a better understanding of the behaviour of cold-formed steel members due to the increase of residential construction market (Yu and LaBoube, 1998). Since this moment, a huge number of research works about the structural behaviour of cold-formed profiles have been developed up to today.
According to Kaitila (2002), the increase of the local imperfections magnitude leads to a relative straightforward decrease of initial stiffness of the elements, while the global imperfections magnitude have more influence in the ultimate load. However, the distortional buckling failure may also be affected by initial geometric imperfections.
About cold-formed steel members subjected to elevated temperatures there are here presented some studies on its behaviour.
Lee (2004) performed his PhD research work about the local buckling behaviour and design of cold-formed steel compression members at elevated temperatures. The experimental and numerical results demonstrated that the local buckling stress at high temperatures highly depends on the deterioration of the elasticity modulus. Therefore, the theoretical equation for local buckling stress could be simply modified considering a reduced elasticity modulus.
A research work develop by Feng et al. (2004) allowed to conclude that the normal temperature buckling curve for columns in ENV1993 Part 1-3 (CEN, 2001b) was not clearly adapted for fire design since it will overestimate column strength, and also to conclude that the buckling curve for columns in ENV1993 Part 1-2 (CEN, 2001a), originally developed for hot-rolled steel, seemed to produce safe and acceptable results.
A numerical simulation of catenary action in cold-formed steel sheeting in fire was performed by Lu et al. (2007) and concluded that the sheeting structure bent and buckled upwards first due to thermal expansion and axial restraints when connecting the sheeting to the supports causes high compression force in the structure. As a consequence, the structure deforms rapidly with high deformation values due to stiffness degradation when increasing the temperature. It was also possible to conclude that the catenary force in the structure has a significant role to sustain the applied load.
An experimental study of the mechanical properties for light gauge cold-formed steels at high temperatures was developed by Ranawaka and Mahendran (2009). New predictive equations were developed for the determination of yield strength and elasticity modulus at high temperatures, as well as a new stress-strain model for high strength cold-formed steels. An improvement was proposed to this equations in case of low strength steels by Kankanamge and Mahendran (2011).
Also Ranawaka and Mahendran (2010) developed a finite element model capable of simulating the distortional buckling behaviour on cold-formed steel elements under compression at normal and high temperatures. The validated model was used to investigate the effect of different types of distortional buckling mode, initial geometric imperfections, residual stresses and mechanical properties. The results demonstrated the importance of the exact use of the mechanical properties at high temperatures in fire safety projects of cold-formed steel elements under compression.
A parametric study on the behaviour of cold-formed steel lipped channel beams subjected to lateral-torsional buckling at elevated temperatures was performed by Dolamune Kankanamge and Mahendran (2012) and the Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) predictions were found to be over-conservative for all the temperatures.
In the research work of Lopes et al. (2012, 2013) and Arrais (2012) the influence of initial geometrical imperfections on the determination of the ultimate loads of cold-formed steel beams and columns at high temperatures was analysed and it was concluded that these imperfections are relevant to the determination of those ultimate loads, thus they should be considered. The influence of residual stresses was also analysed and it was concluded that they did not have significant impact on the resistance values when considered all the initial geometric imperfections combined.
Laim et al. (2014) concluded on an experimental analysis on cold-formed steel beams subjected to fire that these elements can fail in a variety of buckling modes (local, distortional and lateral-torsional buckling) at normal and elevated temperatures, observing that the lateral-torsional buckling mode was the main failure mode responsible for the collapse of the open beams and the distortional buckling mode the responsible for the collapse of the closed built-up beams.
Arrais et al. (2014) performed a parametric study of the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of simply supported members with cold-formed lipped channel sections, in case of fire. The influence of different steel grades, cross-sections slenderness and loading types was evaluated and new design rules were proposed.
A research project occurred on Czech Republic, between 2014 and 2015, on the behaviour of cold-formed purlins at fire conditions where the main investigator was the Ing. Michal Jandera, Ph.D. The aim of the project was to develop an analytical model of
cold-formed thin-walled sections behaviour in fire and to obtain their resistance. The model should be based on a substantial parametric numerical study (GMNIA) made in general Finite Elements Software ABAQUS that should be validated on an experimental investigation. On the same topic, Chaves (2014) developed a study on cold-formed purlins at fire conditions connected to sheeting, analysing the EC3 rules approximation to numerical ultimate loads.
Gunalan et al. (2015) focused their research on local buckling studies of columns at high temperatures and concluded that the design predictions at normal temperature can be used to predict the local buckling capacities at elevated temperatures by applying the reduced mechanical properties. Part 1-2 of EC3 recommends the use of the effective area calculated at ambient temperature, but it results in too conservative predictions at high temperatures.
Laim et al. (2015) analysed sigma section beams behaviour at normal and high temperatures. The conclusion from this study was that cold-formed steel beams with web stiffeners may have different structural responses under fire conditions depending on the section shape. Sigma beams presented similar critical temperatures to the lippedchannel beams, regardless the boundary conditions, double-sigma beams behaved differently from the lipped-I beams.
Fire tests of cold-formed profiles continue to be important, to improve numerical models and develop more and more studies to further deepen the knowledge about this topic. In this regard, Muftah et al. (2016) and Craveiro et al. (2016) performed some fire tests of cold-formed steel columns to understand the fire behaviour of these members and to obtain the respective fire resistance to apply them on numerical studies and compare the results with the standard rules.
Javed et al. (2017) performed a review about the most recent research about cold-formed steel members at high temperatures. Basically, the research gaps about this topic, as well as some recommendations, were also proposed. The general conclusions are about how to find the real temperature distribution across the section and along the length of the elements and about the large deflections that is recommended the study of semi-rigid end restraints conditions.
The present thesis theme is within the line of the above mentioned researches, and its development took these and other investigations in consideration.
1.3	Thesis planning and organization
1.3.1	Motivation
Cold-formed steel profiles have been increasingly used in architectural and structural applications on residential, commercial and industrial buildings, incorporated into wall, floor and roof panels. This interest over the years derives from their high mechanical and corrosion resistance, the easy maintenance and for pleasing appearance, as well as its structural efficiency expressed by the high ratio between mechanical resistance and weight when compared to the hot-rolled profiles, contributing to a substantial reduction in the consumption of steel.
However, the fire design rules for some of these profiles have demonstrated to be too conservative. The EC3 fire part is sometimes unclear on some aspects to take into account for cold-formed steel elements, being widespread to all the steel elements type.
1.3.2	Objectives
The main objectives of this research work were to increase the knowledge on the fire behaviour of cold-formed steel elements and to study and develop, if necessary, simple design rules for these elements (beams, columns and beam-columns).
More specific objectives of the present research work were:
•	to analyse experimental studies characterizing the fire behaviour of cold-formed steel sections from the literature, for the numerical models validation;
•	to perform a parametric study of cold-formed steel profiles behaviour varying the geometry of the element cross-section, the length of the element, the steel grade, the loading type and the different boundary conditions;
•	to compare the obtained numerical results for the ultimate loads with the simplified calculation formulae prescribed in Parts 1-2 of EC3;
•	and, if necessary, to propose new design methodologies;
1.3.3	Thesis organization

The first and current chapter provides a general introduction to the different subjects addressed in this work. The main objectives are also described as well as the motivation to develop this research.
In Chapter 2, some general concepts and fundamentals of structural stability related to the subject of the research work as well as stability analysis concepts are presented. Different types of stability analysis, initial imperfections and some specific methods of analysis are presented.
The Chapter 3 is dedicated to the presentation of structural elements design according to the EC3, including cross-section and members resistance.
A range of different experimental tests performed by different authors are modelled and analysed on Chapter 4, where important considerations are drawn for the numerical analysis presented in Chapter 5.

FUNDAMENTALS ON COLD-FORMED PROFILES
2.1	General considerations
All engineering problems involve equilibrium. Stability concepts and analysis are going to be explored in this section with special focus on cold-formed steel elements.
2.2	instability
2.2.1	Structural behaviour of cold-formed profiles
The equilibrium state of a structure subjected to a given “action” can be “stable” or “unstable”. When this structure is subjected to a compressive force/stress sufficiently high, the tendency is to lose its stiffness and the geometry can be changed, becoming unstable. With the occurrence of the instability phenomenon, the structure loses it load capacity and cannot find a stable equilibrium configuration.
The use of thin-walled sections and cold-forming processes can result in some design problems on cold-formed steel structures, not normally found on thick hot-rolled steel structures. Some of these problems are mentioned below (Dubina et al., 2012; Yu, 2000).
Due to the high slenderness of the individual components of cold-formed steel members and the low torsional stiffness on thin-walled open cross-sections, these elements can buckle. The different instability modes depend on the buckling length (section 2.2.2).
Cold-formed sections are usually thin. Open cross-section steel members are more likely to undergo torsional deformation due to their low torsional rigidity resulting from their thin walls. Additionally, if the sections are loaded eccentrically, which typically occur in mono-symmetric sections where the shear centre doesn't coincide with the centroid (Figure 2.1), the torsional buckling becomes a critical factor for these elements.
On open cross-sections, warping is a phenomenon that can occur and influence the deformation mode, when subjected to bending moment. On beam-columns the warping torsion is easy to control with simple equations for lateral buckling. End conditions have a big influence on mechanical resistance (Figure 2.2).
Figure 2.2 - Torsion with unrestrained and restrained warping (Adapted from Dubina et al. (2012))
Webs may cripple if end and intermediate stiffeners are not in used in cold-formed steel structural members, due to the high local or reaction intensity (Figure 2.3). There are other reasons for web crippling: in some cases, the webs are not vertical and have a slight inclination; the depth-to-thickness ratios of cold-formed members web are normally larger than hot-rolled members’.
Figure 2.3 - Web crippling of cold-formed structural members without stiffeners (Winter, 1970)
To increase de strength of cold-formed steel sections, edge and intermediate stiffeners should be applied. Figure 2.4 shows the resistance increasing in function of the number of stiffeners.
Figure 2.4 - Influence of edge and intermediate stiffeners at the cross-section resistance (Adapted from Silvestre and Camotim (2006))
Due to the effect of cold-forming and stiffeners, the yield stress increases but the
ductility is lower (Figure 2.5).
Figure 2.5 - Steel hardening process before/after cold-forming (Veríssimo, 2008)
2.2.2	Buckling modes
Buckling is an instability phenomenon which occurs normally on thin plates, when subjected to forces in-plane. The perfectly plane thin plate element from Figure 2.6, with a x b dimensions, is simply supported along all four edges and subjected to axial compression on minor direction size (x direction).
Figure 2.6 - Simply supported plate uniformly compressed in x direction (Reis and Camotim, 2001)
Applying a ax stress, deformations out of the plate plane can occur, returning to the initial position when removed the stress that created this deformation, if \x has a reduced value.
The smallest stress not imposing permanent deformations is called elastic critical buckling stress, \cr. If \x is lower than \cr the plate naturally acquires its initial position after unloading, but when the \x value is higher than \cr, the plate deformation still increasing, suffering buckling (Beg et al., 2010; Reis and Camotim, 2001; Vila Real, 2004).
As it is known, most of cold-formed profiles have a very thin wall, which leads to having a high susceptibility to suffer instability phenomena. The instability mode depends on the length of the element, its cross-section (shape and size) and boundary conditions.
With regard to the stability behaviour and instability modes, a bar with thin wall section can be classified according to their length as (Prola, 2001):
•	Short bar - if instability occurs with a local mode;
•	Long bar - if instability occurs with a global mode;
• Intermediate bar - if instability occurs in a combination of a local mode with a
global mode (distortional mode).
It is also possible to obtain the elastic buckling stress and identify the corresponding instability modes (see Figure 2.7).
Short bar
Intermediate bar
Long bar
Figure 2.7 - Buckling stresses, bar length and respective instability modes (CEN, 2006a)
Some of these examples with lipped-channel sections studied with finite strip analysis are presented (Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9).
2.2.2.1	Local instability
Cold-formed steel elements are a set of long plates connected by the longitudinal borders (Figure 2.10). This instability mode is characterized by small half-wave lengths comparing with other instability modes and half-wave lengths are in the order of the width of individual plate elements (Figure 2.11) (Yu and LaBoube, 2010).
Figure 2.10 - Hat-section beam local instability of top flange (Winter, 1970)
Figure 2.11 - Square and rectangular plates subjected to compression stress (Adapted from Yu and LaBoube (2010)
The compression critical stress acr from Figure 2.11 can be taken as (CEN, 2006b):
d8E	/t\
°cr = k °E = k 12(1-v2h\b)
(2.1)
For local instability there is a specific configuration of the cross-section elements:
•	The longitudinal internal corners only suffer rotation, absent of translation movement;
•	Deflection of internal walls causes section deformations, as opposite to external walls that have a free edge, therefore they undergo rigid element displacements;
•	As already mentioned, local plate mode origin small half-wave lengths which are in the order of the width of individual plate elements and creates an “undulated shape” on element walls;
•	Edge conditions of the element only influence the local plate mode of end crosssection, not on the rest of the element.
2.2.2.2	Distortional instability
Distortional instability mode has been considered as one of the most important limit states for cold-formed steel elements with edge-stiffened compression (Yu and LaBoube, 2010). This instability mode is characterized by half-wave lengths 5-10 times larger than local half-wave lengths, not always considered as a local instability mode, and by the stiffness buckling.
On flange distortional instability, the flange and the stiffness rotate about web-flange union with some rotational resistance provided by the web (Figure 2.12). This type of instability mode only occurs in open cross-sections such as C, Z and Z sections (Moen and Schafer, 2009).
Figure 2.12 - Distortional modes: a) axial compression; b) bending (Pala, 2006)
For distortional instability there is a specific configuration of the cross-section elements as showed on Figure 2.12:
•	The longitudinal internal corners suffer rotation;
•	Part of the cross section suffers distortion and the other undergoes rigid element displacements of the internal walls;
•	On stiffeners, they suffer high warping displacements;
•	Edge conditions of the element influence the elements shape.
2.2.2.3	Global instability
Global instability, also called as Euler instability mode (Euler buckling), defines the full member instability at long half-wave lengths, including both flexural and flexural-torsional effects (Figure 2.13) for columns and lateral-torsional effects in beams (Trahair, 1993).
a) Flexural
b) Torsional
Figure 2.13 - Forms of global instability
In this instability:
•	Cross-sections of the element do not suffer deformations; they undergo rigid element displacements (only flexural and torsional movements of all crosssection). None cross-section element suffers distortion;
•	Critical global modes of flexural or flexural-torsional create a single half-wave length. A beam simply supported at both directions, with torsional rotation prevented and warping allowed at both ends, the half-wave length is the element length. In other examples with different support conditions, the number of halfwave lengths may be different (Figure 2.14);
•	Edge conditions of the element influence the elements shape because of their significant warping displacements.
This instability mode becomes critical for longest and un-braced elements.
Figure 2.14 - Half-wave lengths according to support and load conditions (Arrais, 2012)
2.2.2.4	Interaction between buckling modes
Interaction between buckling modes is a set of phenomena that affect the behaviour of geometrically non-linear structural systems characterized by simultaneous or almost simultaneous occurrence of buckling modes (Reis and Camotim, 2001). On cold-formed steel elements, this phenomenon is more certain to occur due to its high slenderness. These buckling modes may occur on elastic or elastic-plastic behaviour. However, plasticity occurs on an advanced post-buckling behaviour, which leads to the modes arise mostly in the elastic behaviour. Therefore, it is considered that the collapse of these elements occurs when one reaches the limit of proportionality of steel.
2.2.3	Plates behaviour
Plates study was always a complex problem to solve in engineering. There are different variables to study which are considered on engineering solutions, involving rectangular plates with infinite equations that difficult the precision of the obtained results. The real problems join multiple plates and the solution becomes even more complicated. The buckling theory of compressed plates is the basis of I-beams design. The beams flanges can be designed as long plates under a uniform compression where it is assumed that one of the ends is simply supported and the other is free. On the other hand, the web can be designed as a long plate, considering the two closer ends simply supported.
The stresses caused by bending moment in an I-beam are shown in Figure 2.15, where the flanges are subjected to uniform normal stresses and the web is subjected to nonuniform normal stresses.
Figure 2.15 - Stresses in a I-beam due to bending (Reis and Arrais, 2014)
The member behaviour it will be defined by the behaviour of individual plates. The bending theory of thin plates is similar to the theory of beams but considering the effects in two different directions.
On numerical studies, different problems of instability usually occur. Therefore, it is important to understand the different behaviours of simple plates under different loading and boundary conditions types.
2.2.3.1	Individual plate loading analysis
Here are presented some common situations that occur on cold-formed steel elements plates. For each solicitation the respective buckling mode on individual simply supported plate is presented. The considered situations are:
• a plate simply supported in its four edges, subjected to uniform uniaxial
compression (a = 1), as shown in Figure 2.16.
Figure 2.16 — Plate under uniform uniaxial compression (Reis and Arrais, 2014)
Considering the plate as an internal compression element, the buckling modes for different dimensions are presented on (Figure 2.17):

• a plate simply supported in its four edges, subjected to bending, as shown in
Figure 2.18.

Considering the plate as an internal bending element, for a = 0, the results are on
Figure 2.19.

And considering the plate as an internal bending element, for a = _1, the buckling shape is observed in Figure 2.20.

• a plate simply supported in its four edges, subjected to shear, as shown in Figure
2.21.

Considering the plate as an internal element under shear, the effect observed is presented in Figure 2.22.

Figure 2.22 - Some buckling modes of plates in shear: a) 1000x250 mm2 and b) 1000x2000 mm2
For each type of load, an internal element may have quite different plate behaviours. It is important to recognise and to know how to identify the different types of buckling modes to interpret the numerical results.
2.2.3.2	Cold-formed steel sections as composition of plates
Considering a numerical model of a lipped-channel cross-section beam under bending action, for a = —1, on Figure 2.23 it is possible to observe the first buckling mode (local buckling) of a beam and the plate behaviour of the flange similar to a plate simply supported under compression and the plate behaviour of the lip similar to a plate simply supported on three edges and free in the fourth edge under bending action, for = 0.5.
Figure 2.23 - First buckling mode of a beam in bending, k = —1 and the respective individual plates behaviour
For another C cross-section beam under bending action example, ^ = —1 (Figure 2.24), it is possible to observe the first buckling mode (local buckling) where the plate behaviour of the web is similar to a plate simply supported under bending.
Figure 2.24 - First buckling mode of a beam in bending, k — —1, base on the buckling mode of a plate in bending (web)
And considering a numerical model of a beam under bending action, for ^ — 1, Figure 2.25, it is possible to observe the first buckling mode (local buckling) of a beam with a specific length (small length) and the plate behaviour of the web similar to a plate simply supported under shear.
Figure 2.25 - First buckling mode of a beam in bending, k = 1, based on the buckling mode of a plate in shear (web)
It is possible to understand the element's behaviour knowing the typical plate behaviour under different boundary conditions and loading types. In this way, some particular problems on numerical models can be easily interpreted.
2.3	Ultimate bearing capacity
Considering the imperfections is fundamental for the ultimate bearing capacity determination. Numerical and analytical main methods are generically here presented.
2.3.1	Imperfections influence
Real structures do not exhibit, in general, bifurcation instabilities due to the existing of initial geometric imperfections (Reis and Camotim, 2001). However, the critical elastic bifurcation load influences significantly the structures behaviour and its ultimate load.
2.3.1.1	Initial geometric imperfections
All the structures are imperfect. Imperfections can be from geometric shapes, residual stresses and yield strength distribution across the section. Geometrical and material imperfections are functions of plate width and thickness, and of the forming process.
According to Schafer and Pekoz (1998a), the geometric imperfections are related to the deviation of an element from “perfect” geometry. Imperfections include bowing, warping and twisting such as local deviations characterized by dents and regular plate waves.
In practice, each element has it deviation from a perfect geometry due to manufacturing process, storage, transportation, handling and installation. Following Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b), geometric imperfections may be based on the shape of the critical plate buckling modes with amplitudes given in the National Annex, where it is recommended 80% of the geometric fabrication tolerances.
The geometric imperfections and residual stresses characterization is largely complicated. Cold-formed steel elements post-buckling is difficult to predict if geometric imperfections and material non-linearity exist. However, allowance for these imperfections may be achieved incorporating geometric imperfections which values reflect all imperfection types. According to Part 1-1 of EC3 (CEN, 2005a), global and local imperfections should be taken into account. Distortional imperfection is an intermediate state between local and global imperfections that should be considered depending on their big influence on the numerical models. These buckling mode shapes could be determined for local imperfections with the highest value of b/100 multiplied by 0,8 (CEN, 2006b), or according to recent studies with the value of 10% of the wall
thickness, t (Basaglia and Camotim, 2011; Borges Dinis and Camotim, 2010). For global buckling mode, the global imperfections were considered with a sinusoidal shape given by the expression:
y = 0,8 — sinf—1
750 \ L )
(2.2)
Following Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) a combination of the previous enunciated buckling modes is introduced on a numerical model. According to this rule, in combining imperfections, a leading imperfection should be chosen and the accompanying imperfections may have their values reduced to 70%.
2.3.1.2	Residual stresses
Cold-formed steel elements begin as thick, molten, hot steel plates. Each slab is typically hot-rolled, the thickness cold reduced and annealed to subsequently be rolled up and transported as a thin sheet of elements for cold-formed producers. At forming moment, the steel sheet is unwound by a production line and plastically folded to obtain the final shape of the desired element (roll-forming process). This manufacturing process imparts residual stresses and plastic strains through the sheet thickness (Lankford et al., 1985).
Residual stresses of cold-formed steel elements affect it stiffness and may cause a premature initial deformation which will cause the ultimate strength reduction. Residual stresses can be from two different types: flexural and membrane (Figure 2.26).
Figure 2.26 - Definition of flexural and membrane residual stresses through the thickness (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a)
Flexural residual stresses are compressive in the inner surface and tensile in the outer surface. On the other hand, membrane residual stresses are compressive or tensile and are the same through the entire thickness (Weng and Pekoz, 1988a).
In hot-rolled steel elements residual stresses do not exhibit big variation through the thickness, but on cold-formed steel elements residual stresses are dominated by a “flexural”. This can cause the early yielding on the faces of cold-formed steel plates (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a).
The cold-rolling process causes different residual stresses on cross-sections when compared to press-braking process, on cold-forming. Therefore, the cross-section resistance may be different when buckling and yielding interact (Hancock, 1997) (Table 2.1).
Table 2.1 - Type magnitude of residual stresses in steel section (ASRO (2008))
	Forming Method		
	Hot-rolling	Cold-forming	
		Cold-rolling	Press braking
Membrane residual stresses (orm)	High	Low	Low
Flexural residual stresses (Orf)	Low	High	Low
On cold-formed steel elements, the membrane residual stresses present, in general, small values when compared with flexural residual stresses (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a).
Pi et al. (1998) adopted the residual stresses configuration recommended by Weng and Pekoz (1988a) but with a small adaptation of the model. As mentioned previously, there are tension residual stresses on the outside surface of the section, and compression residual stresses on the inside surface. Their values are assumed to be varied linearly through the plate thickness and are different for linear or curved section members. According to Weng and Pekoz (1988a), the magnitudes of the maximum tension and compression residual stresses are assumed to be the same and are taken as 50% of the yield stress for straight members, and 65% of the yield stress for corners. These residual stress distributions satisfy bending moment equilibrium conditions (Eq. 2.3 and 2.4) but not the axial force equilibrium conditions (Eq. 2.5).
I ar.y. dA = 0	(2.3)
J A
— I ar.x. dA = 0	(2.4)
J A
\r. dA V 0	(2.5)
That occurs because the outside corner area, with tensile residual stress, is larger than the inside corner area, with compressive residual stresses. So, Pi et al. (1998), to satisfy both equilibrium conditions, replaced the 65% of the yield stress for corners to —0.65u@(2 ti/t) for inside surface and +0.65o@(2 t0/t) for outside surface, where:
t¿ = yr2 X rt X t2/2 — r
to	t t¿
(2.6)
(2.7)
With r the corner radius and t the corner thickness (Figure 2.27).
Figure 2.27 - Residual stresses distribution a) around the C-section, b) through section wall at flats and lips, c) through section wall at corners (Pi et al., 1998)
A research developed by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) allowed a distribution of residual stresses as a percentage of yield stress for two cold-forming processes, cold-rolling and press braking, for cold-formed steel C-sections, which values are presented on Table 2.2 and Table 2.3. The results are distributed by elements where the residual stresses were measured: corner, flange, lip and web.

The residual stress model adopted by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) is shown on Figure
2.28 with the flexural residual stress configuration for two cold-forming processes.
Figure 2.28 - Bending residual stresses for a) cold-rolling process and b) press braking process (Schafer and Pekoz, 1998a)
In fire conditions, Franssen (1993) argues that the residual stresses are not lost with temperature increasing. The residual stresses behaviour and effect are different being less influential as the temperature increases and for largest lengths.
However, according to Lee (2004), residual stresses will be lost when the element is exposed to elevated temperatures. Therefore, it must be taken into account a reduction factor for the residual stresses at high temperatures. This reduction factor is obtained by the following linear equation (Eq. 2.8), obtained by the same author which depend on the element temperature, or by interpolating the values presented on Table 2.4:
a = 1,0181 - 0,001283	(2.8)
where T (temperature) is in °C, and 20 &amp;lt;T &amp;lt;800.
Table 2.4 - Reduction factors for residual stresses
Temp. (°C)	20	200	350	500	650	800
z	1,00	0,76	0,57	0,38	0,19	0,00
So, the residual stresses configuration according to Lee (2004) is shown on
Figure 2.29.
Figure 2.29 - Residual stresses configuration with temperature effects, Lee (2004)
Considering the above mentioned, Ranawaka and Mahendran (2010) applied a new set of residual stresses, based on Schafer and Pekoz (1998a), as shown on Figure 2.30, considering 17% of the yield stress for internal flat elements and 8% of the yield stress for outstand flat elements.
Residual stress through thickness

In Chapter 5, a study on the influence of the residual stress distribution is presented.
2.3.2	Load-carrying capacity analytical determination
The European Standard design of cold-formed steel elements is based on effective sections method, considering the reduction of sections resistance due to local buckling, reducing each elements dimension of effective cross-section.
However, with lips (edge stiffeners) appearing on cold-formed steel sections, another instability problem appears: the distortional buckling. So, it is important to considerer this instability mode to determine the effective cross-section.
On local instability mode the effective section is determined by the effective width concept, where the reduction occurs on elements width, while the distortional instability
mode is determined by the effective thickness concept, where the reduction occurs on elements thickness (Table 2.5) (CEN, 2006a).
Table 2.5 - Effective cross-section for different types of instabilities

The North American Specification for the design of cold-formed steel structures (AISI S100 2007) describes the method to obtain the cross-sections properties, and suggest, when applicable, the effective design widths to calculate those section properties, or the Direct Strength Method, presented on Appendix 1 from this standard, for some prequalified elements.
According to the EC3, Part 1-3 (CEN, 2006a), local buckling effects are represented by effective cross-section properties, obtained by the effective width method, and for distortional buckling is suggested the calculation of reduced thickness of edge and intermediate elements from cross-section. Intermediate steps for determining crosssections properties are described on the EC3, Part 1-3 (CEN, 2006a), and Part 1-5 (CEN, 2006b).
Effective width method is adopted by almost all standardization documents related to cold-formed steel structures (CEN, 2006a). Currently, the design of cold-formed steel elements for local buckling depends on the effective width approach. The direct application of this empirical method has been used since 1940, the inception of cold-formed steel design, and continues to be used in the design of full thin-walled structures. The mainly application of this method is for estimate the post-buckling resistance values, on plate post-buckling context.
On effective area method, the effective area is obtained directly from the critical bifurcation stress of all cross-sections. Thus, it is possible to solve some cases that are not covered by the effective width method, as accounting the influence of rotations bending restrictions, which occurs on longitudinal internal edges, and the direct application of this method on sections when the distortional instability mode occurs.
Actually, for different optimised cross-sections not presented on the Eurocode, the application of these two methods can become complicated. In some cases, the interaction between multiple buckling modes is difficult to determine the elastic buckling stress and the effective section properties.
The Direct Strength Method, suggested by Schafer and Pekoz (1998b), is applicable to complex cross-sections, avoiding the complexity of current methods, and makes the design process easier than the Eurocode rules. This method has been calibrated with AISI Standard, with a large number of experimental results, and was accepted by this standard as an alternative design for cold-formed steel elements (such as columns and beams). This method requires the elastic buckling elements behaviour, and then provides a series of nominal strength curves for predicting the elements strength based on elastic buckling behaviour.
2.3.3	Approximate numerical methods
As mentioned before, some instability problems can be founded on cold-formed steel elements under axial compression. Buckling problems (such as local, distortional, flexural buckling, flexural-torsional and local interaction, or local and global interaction) reduce the ultimate failure loads significantly. Therefore, approximate methods must be applied to eliminate the buckling problems or to delay it action.
Approximate numerical methods available may be classified by two groups, according to their application, using equilibrium differential equations or the system potential energy. The second ones can only be applied in conservative problems. Some of these methods, relevant for this work, are very briefly presented below (Reis and Camotim, 2001; Simitses and Hodges, 2006): the Finite Element Method and the Finite Strip Method, as both were applied in this research work.
Generalized Beam Theory is an extension to conventional engineering beam theory that allows cross-section distortion to be considered, applied to equilibrium differential equations (bars only) and the displacements are “pure deformation modes” previously identified and chosen. However, within the scope of this study will not be applied.
2.3.3.1	Finite Element Method (FEM)
The FEM is applied to equilibrium differential equations and to the potential energy. It involves two discretization structural levels: structure division in finite elements, with simple geometry, generating a nodes mesh between the elements; and inside the finite element, the approximation of the displacement shape combining linear functions.
The FEM has been widely used in design of structures since the 60's. Engineers used the method for approximate solutions of problems in stress analysis, fluid flow, heat transfer, and other areas (Cook et al., 1989).
“The finite element method is one of the most powerful numerical techniques ever devised for solving differential (and integral) equations of initial and boundary-value problems in geometrically complicated regions.” (Reddy, 1984). It is a numerical procedure for analysing structures which are too complicated to be solved applying a classical analytical method. The results are approximated, but errors are decreased by processing more equations.
On FEM the structure is divided into a finite number of small and simple elements, then reconnected with nodes, and this process results in a set of simultaneous algebraic equations. The advantage of dividing a big element into small ones is that it allows to the small element simple shape (different between them), which leads to a good approximation for the analysis. Another advantage is that at every node occurs an interpolation polynomial. The Figure 2.31 shows a problem that illustrates de
discretization process of cold-formed profile used in real life practical solutions, with the finite element concept.
Figure 2.31 — a) Madremax and b) a possible finite element model (Lopes et al., 2016)
SAFIR (Franssen, 2005) is a software developed at the University of Liege in Belgium that applies the finite element method (FEM) for geometric and material non-linear analysis. Being especially developed for the study of structures under fire situations, it has been applied in several research studies, as an example in studies on the evaluation of local buckling at elevated temperatures including validation with experimental tests(Couto et al., 2015), or numerical comparisons with other software (Prachar et al., 2014). Due to its characteristics, this software is applied on the FEM analysis of the current research work.
2.3.3.2	Finite Strip Method (FSM)
The FSM is a modification of the FEM, adapted to structures with a regular geometric configuration and simple boundary conditions and load applications. The geometry is always the same along the longitudinal axis (Figure 2.32 b)).
Figure 2.32 — Element discretization in a) finite elements and b) finite strips (Schafer and Adany, 2006)
The finite strip method was first introduced by Cheung (1968) and is less powerful and versatile than the finite element method, but more efficient for the computational modelling of some cases. This method is semi-numerical and semi-analytical, and it is suitable for the following types of civil engineering structures such as bridge slabs, box girders, roofs consisting of plane elements. Basically, the FSM reduces a twodimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem.
On Finite Strip Method the element suffers discretization, only in the cross-section plane, being divided into finite strips, all of them with the same length (of the bar) and connected by “nodal lines” and approximation by polynomials on longitudinal direction. This method is particularly better to perform the stability analysis of structures with a precise or approximated periodical variation of displacements configuration on longitudinal direction.
The CUFSM software (Schafer and Adany, 2006) was developed to analyse the elastic buckling behaviour. It generates the critical elastic buckling modes and the thin-walled members deformation, originally created to research the behaviour of cold-formed steel members under uniform longitudinal stresses (such as axial, bending, warping torsion, or their combination). CUFSM is most commonly used for thin-walled cold-formed steel members and apply the semi-analytical finite strip method (FSM) to provide solutions for the cross-section of these members. To complement the research work performed in this thesis, this software is also here applied.

3.1	General considerations
According to EC3, the analysis and design of cold-formed steel structures contain some differences from hot-rolled steel structures.
The EC3, Part 1-3 (CEN, 2006a), provides design requirements for cold-formed thin elements and sheeting. These rules are applied to cold-formed steel products made from coated or uncoated thin gauge hot/cold-rolled sheet cold-formed by such processes as cold-rolling or press-braking (Dubina et al., 2012). The EN 1090 covers the execution of cold-formed steel structures, and the calculation rules given in this standard are only valid if the cold-formed members manufacturing tolerances fulfil the EN 1090-2 (CEN, 2008) limits, to ensure adequate levels of mechanical resistance as well as stability, serviceability and durability levels.
The French National Annex (FN Annex) of the EC3, Part 1-2 (CEN, 2007), proposes the use of different design formulae and steel constitutive law for cold-formed profiles at elevated temperatures, which will be analysed and applied in this study.
3.2	steel mechanical characteristics of cold-formed sections
Material properties have an important role in the structural members behaviour. Therefore, it is important to be familiar with the mechanical properties of the steel sheets, strip and plates of cold-formed steel elements before designing it.
According to Part 1-1 of EC3 (CEN, 2005a), for the structural steels covered by this Eurocode Part, the material coefficients to be adopted in calculations should be taken as follow:
•	Elasticity modulus: E = 210 000 MPa (N/mm2);
•	Shear modulus: G = —-— ~ 81 000 MPa (N/mm2);
•	Poisson's ration in elastic stage: v = 0,30.
Partial factors yMi for buildings may be defined in the National Annex.
Other important properties depending on the steel grade and manufacturing process are: basic yield strength (fyb), average yield strength (fya) and ultimate tensile strength (f?).
On Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) the design cold-formed members and profiled sheets fabricated from steel material must be conform the different types of steel standards and steel grades, and the respective nominal values of basic yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, listed on the same document in Table 3.1a and Table 3.1b.
In general, cold forming leads to a modification of the steel stress-strain curve.
Cold rolling provides an increase of the yield strength and sometimes of the ultimate strength, which revealed to be important in the corners and still being significant in the flanges (Table 3.1). This influence does not occur in hot-rolled cross-sections.
Table 3.1 - Influence of manufacturing process on the basic strengths of cold-formed profiles (ASRO, 2008)
Cold forming
Forming method	-----------------------
		Cold rolling	Press braking
Yield strength (fy)	Corner	High	High
	Flange	Moderate	-
Ultimate strength (fu)	Corner	High	High
	Flange	Moderate	-
On one hand, the basic yield strength increase is due to strain hardening (especially due to corners folding) and depends on the type of steel used on cold rolling process. On the other hand, the ultimate strength increase is related to strain aging, accompanied with the ductility decrease, which depends on the metallurgical properties of the material. Therefore, it is common to take advantage of the steel hardening on steel elements design and apply the average yield strength (fya), whose value is higher than the basic yield strength (fyb).
According to Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) the increased yield strength due to cold forming may be taken into account in axially loaded members whose effective crosssection area (Aeyy) equals the gross area (Ag), or in determining Ae?f the yield strength (fy) should be taken as the basic yield strength (fyb).
The average value of yield stress increases with the number of bends, and may be determined from the results of full size tests or by calculation using Eq. (3.1):
(7» + fyb)
2
(3.1)
where,
•	Ag is the gross cross-sectional area;
•	k is the numerical coefficient that depends on the type of forming (k = 7 for roll forming and k = 5 for other methods of forming);
•	n is the number of 90° bends in the cross-section with an internal radius l &amp;lt;5) (fractions of 90° bends should be counted as fractions of n)
•	) is the design core thickness of the steel material before cold-forming.
When the probability of occurrence of local instability phenomenon is low (crosssection profiles with Class 1, 2 or 3), it is possible to apply the average yield strength (fya) on tensile zones instead of the basic yield strength (fyb). In the cold-formed steel elements production is very common to use galvanized steel with yield strength (fy) with values between 200 and 600 N/mm2 and with ultimate strength (f?) in the range of 300 to 750 N/mm2.
To determine the resistance capacity of a steel structure is important to consider the instability phenomena. The high steel resistance often leads to design slender structures, where the global behaviour is extremely affected by the instability modes.
The stress-strain diagram which describes the material behaviour is known as “elasticplastic” and characterized by (Reis and Camotim, 2001):
•	An elastic range/region (initial elastic domain): reversible on an initial domain with linear development (slope corresponding to the elasticity mode, E);
•	A plastic range/region (plastic domain): irreversible, where a discharge of the material, after an elastic domain, occurs in parallel with the elastic linear development and generates permanent deformations, often with a non-linear development (variable ET value).
The Figure 3.1 shows part of the stress-strain diagram for structural steel for modelling the material behaviour.

Figure 3.1 - Partial stress-strain curve for structural steel (Brockenbrough and Johnston, 1968)
Cold-formed mechanical properties can suffer several changes when the steel element is under fire conditions. Apply the temperature uniform throughout the cross-section is possible due to the high thermal steel conductivity and its reduced thickness. To consider this mechanical resistance and stiffness loss, it is necessary to apply the reduction factor of Young's modulus and the reduction factor of yield strength according to the applied temperature (CEN, 2005b).
According to Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b), Annex E (Class 4 cross-sections), for the design under fire conditions, the yield strength of steel should be taken as the 0,2% proof strength (used to determine the resistance to tension, compression, moment or shear). For the other cross-section classes, the yield strength of steel to apply corresponds to the stress at 2% total strain (Figure 3.2).

According to EC3, thin-walled cross-sections are classified as Class 4 (CEN, 2005a).
For these cross-sections, Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) states that the conventional
limit of proportionality at 0.2%, fo.2,p,o, should be used instead of the yield strength for a total strain of 2%, fyo, as proposed for stocky.
The FN Annex of Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2007) proposes a different design approach for thin-walled cross-sections and different reduction factors for the steel constitutive laws at elevated temperatures for cold-formed profiles (Zhao et al., 2005). These new material laws are obtained from different reduction factors for the yield strength and Young’s modulus at high temperatures. The FN Annex proposes lower values for these reduction factors for cold-formed profiles. The comparison of the different constitutive laws between the Annex E and the FN Annex from Part 1-2 of EC3 is presented in Figure 3.3.

3.3	Design rules at high temperatures
Design in case of fire is mainly concerned with preventing the structural collapse before the specified fire resistance period. During a fire, large deformations are accepted and normally they do not need to be calculated, as usual at normal temperature design (Buchanan, 2001; Franssen and Vila Real, 2010). According to Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) the model of the structural system should reflect the expected performance of the structure in fire verifying that, during a relevant duration of fire exposure t:
Efi,d — 2fi,d,t	(3.2)
where, Ej-ld is the design effect of actions for the fire situation and Rfid,t is the corresponding design resistance of the member in the fire situation at time t.
3.3.1	Classification of cross-sections
Steel structural cross-sections may be considered as an assembly of individual plate elements divided into two different types: internal elements and outstand elements (Figure 3.4).
Figure 3.4 - Internal and outstand elements
Due to the reduced thickness plate elements in structural sections, compared with their width, when loaded in compression (result of axial compression or bending) local buckling may occur in these elements.
The EC3 defines four cross-section classes in order to identify the extent to which the resistance and rotation capacity of cross-sections is limited by its local buckling resistance (CEN, 2005a).
Thin-walled cold-formed steel elements usually have a cross-section classification equivalent to sections of Class 4 or, at most, Class 3. Compared to hot-rolled crosssections (frequently of Class 1 or 2), only the elastic analysis is taken into account, because cold-formed steel elements are characterized by a reduced post-elastic strength and by a reduced ductility (i.e. without a sufficient plastic rotation capacity to form plastic hinges).
Class 4 cross-sections may be replaced by an effective Class 3 cross-section (Franssen and Vila Real, 2010). The obtained cross-section only takes into account the gross section without the parts where the local buckling effect can occur (Figure 3.5).
Gross cross-section
Figure 3.5 - Effective cross-section
3.3.2	Effective cross-sectional properties
The design of cold-formed steel elements is based on the method of the effective crosssection, considering the cross-sectional resistance reduction due to local instability, which reduces the length of each part of the cross-section as referred before. However, the existence of stiffeners on cross-section elements leads to the occurrence of distortional instability effects.
Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the instability mode to obtain the effective cross-section. According to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a):
•	local and distortional buckling effects should be considered to determining the resistance and stiffness of cold-formed members and sheeting;
•	to consider the local buckling effects, it may be used the effective crosssectional properties calculated with the method of the effective width;
•	in determining local buckling resistance, the yield strength (&lt;@) should be taken as the basic yield strength (fyb);
•	distortional buckling shall be taken into account where it constitutes a critical failure mode;
•	to consider the distortional buckling effects, it may be used the effective crosssectional properties calculated with the reduced thickness method.
3.3.2.1	Local instability (Method of the Effective Width)
As mentioned before, according to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) the local buckling effects are taken into account with effective cross-sectional properties obtained with the Method of the Effective Width (Figure 3.6).
a) Simple bending
-I L .
b) Axial compression
Figure 3.6 - Effective cross section with the Method of Effective Width
The stress distribution is characterized by low stress values on central part and maximum stress values on longitudinal edges. Von Karman et al. (1932) introduced the “effective width” concept (Figure 3.7). Instead of considering the “non-linear” stress distribution ax(y), over the entire width of the plate b, it is assumed that the total load, P, is carried by a fictitious effective width, beff, subjected to a uniformly distributed stress equal to the longitudinal edge stress value, \max (Figure 3.8).
Figure 3.7 - Concept of effective length
Figure 3.8 - Stress distribution in simply supported plate, uniaxially compressed
The beff value presented on Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8 is obtained by Eq. 3.6.
beff -

Thus, the reduction factor for the plate buckling resistance p is obtained by:
p = \E=6£f£	(3.7)

The effective widths of compression elements should be obtained from Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) on Table 4.1 for internal elements and Table 4.2 for outstand elements (tables of the respective document).
The reduction factor p for internal elements under compression is calculated by:
p = 1	for X. &amp;lt;0.5 + y0.085 - 0.055a

and kF is the buckling factor, corresponding to the stress ratio a and boundary
conditions (see Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 from Part 1-5 of EC3).
Calculated the effective width, be//, of each cross-section element, it is possible to determine the new position of the centroidal axis of effective cross-section and calculate the respective properties.
3.3.2.2	Distortional instability (Method of the Reduced Thickness)
For distortional instability, the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) does not provide explicit provisions. However, it is possible to obtain a calculation procedure for plane elements with edge or intermediate stiffeners in compression by applying the Method of the Redyced Thickness (Figure 3.9).

Figure 3.9 - Effective cross section with the Method of Reduced Thickness
For compression elements with edge or intermediate stiffeners, the design is based on the assumption that the stiffness behaves as a compression member with a partial restriction, an equivalent spring stiffness (#), that depends on the boundary conditions and on the flexural stiffness of the adjacent plane elements of the cross-section.
To obtain the spring stiffness of the stiffener, a unit load per unit length (u) is applied on the cross-section stiffener (Figure 3.10).
Figure 3.10 - Determination of the spring stiffness (K) and the respective deflection (&lt;) for C and Z sections according to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a)
The general equation that expresses the spring stiffness per unit length is:

According to the Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a), in case of a plane element with an edge and intermediate stiffener(s), in the absence of a more accurate method, the effect of the intermediate stiffener(s) may be neglected.
The thickness reduction factor _d for the distortional buckling resistance of the edge stiffener should be obtained from the relative slenderness:

Xd = 1.47 - 0.723Xd

(3.18)
(3.19)
Calculated the thickness reduction, tred, of cross-section stiffener, it is possible to determine the new position of the centroidal axis of effective cross-section and calculate the cross-section properties.
3.3.3	Resistance of cross-section and members
The design values of internal forces and moments of a cross-section should not exceed the design values of the corresponding resistances from EC3.
For the design, the local buckling effects shall be taken into account by using the effective cross-section properties. Also, the distortional buckling effects shall be taken into account considering the possibility of lateral buckling occurrence.
The Part 1-3 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) only gives design guidelines for cold-formed steel members at normal temperature. The design method given in Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) can be used for cold-formed steel members. Therefore, the design values are going to be compared with the fire resistance conditions presented on Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) for Class 3 or 4 cross-sections (cold-formed steel members case).
Cross-section verification is not specifically mentioned in the Part 1-2 of EC3. However, there is as clause which mentions that the formulae from Part 1-1 of EC3 could be used if adapted to high temperatures.
3.3.3.1	Axially compressed members
The design value of the compression force in the fire situation, NfiEd, at each cross-
section should satisfy the following condition:
°fi,Ed
°b,fi,t,Rd
According to the Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2005b) the design buckling resistance,

The non-dimensional slenderness X0 for the temperature 0, is given by:

where kE0 is the reduction factor for the Young's modulus.
For the remaining parameters, the FN Annex proposes a design procedure similar to
Part 1-2 of EC3, with particular differences (Table 3.2).

For members with non-symmetric Class 4 cross-sections, the additional moment, •MEd, should be taken into account due to the eccentricity of the centroidal axis of effective cross-section, considering the axial compression and bending moment interaction.

For Class 3 and 4 cross-sections the maximum longitudinal stress obtained with an elastic analysis and based on the gross area of Class 3 cross-sections or the effective area of Class 4 cross-sections should verify the following conditions (Franssen and Vila Real, 2010):

However, the verifications given by Eq. (3.30) and Eq. (3.31) do not cover all cases (Franssen and Vila Real, 2010). In some cases, the cross-section capacity is lower than the overall stability, especially for members subjected to end moments with double curvature (^ = —1), where the maximum moment point is located at the end of the element and not influence the member stability. For members subjected to uniform moment (^ = 1) the overall buckling verified with Eq. (3.30) and Eq. (3.31) will always be more severe than the cross-section verification.
For not doubly symmetrical cross-sections, the axial load will be eccentrically when considering the effective cross-section. Therefore, the additional moment AMEd should be taken into account, as mentioned before, considering:

4.1	General considerations
The evaluation of the cold-formed steel elements resistance and behaviour through an experimental analysis is important on the design and parametric study of these profiles. However, due to the high costs associated to experimental tests the parametrization of the profiles behaviour has been carried out through numerical studies validated.
Simply supported beams, columns and beam-columns are the focused elements analysed in this research work. The most elementary and common cases are selected and here explored due to the extensive different possible cases to choose and study. Beam's analysed cases are the laterally unrestrained members under bending moment around the y-y axis (strong axis), where the lateral torsional buckling can occur. For columns, the considered case is under axial compression and taken into account the buckling around the minor axis (z-z axis due to the cross-sections type analysed in the following chapters - C and S). About beam-columns, the most common case analysed is N+My (with and without lateral torsional buckling). N+Mz is not a situation easy to occur to this kind of analysed cross-sections. Otherwise, it would be necessary to take into account the two-ways of Mz (Mz+ and Mz-).
This chapter presents the validation of the applied numerical models in this work against different experimental works performed by different authors, analysing different parameters that can be important on the numerical models conception, such as restrictions, loads distribution and FEM elements and respective mesh. Table 4.1 shows the different numerically modelled experimental tests, which were important for the validation of numerical models.

In the finite element model, rectangular shell finite elements were used to reproduce local buckling phenomena due to the walls high slenderness. The numerical analysis of cold-formed steel elements of this research work is obtained using the software SAFIR.
Local, distortional and global instability modes obtained in CAST3M (CAST3M, 2012) were used to define the geometrical imperfection shapes by applying the interface with SAFIR, RUBY (developed at the University of Aveiro, in Portugal) (Couto et al., 2013), comparing with the results obtained with CUFSM software.
Residual stresses are not considered on the numerical models due to the lack of information provided by the authors.
4.2	Normal temperature
Experimental tests at normal temperature were modelled due to the lack of experimental tests research on cold-formed steel elements at high temperatures, particularly on beamcolumn's elements. Some of those elements were also adopted for the numerical parametric analysis. Experimental tests with lipped-channel and sigma cross-sections elements are presented and corresponding numerical analysis are performed.
4.2.1	Columns
To investigate the effect of initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses on single lipped sigma columns, Aghoury et al. (2014) analysed and tested eight specimens (see test setup on Figure 4.1). The simply supported lipped sigma columns E_240x60x20x(1.5), paper reference S-60-75, was considered with the length of 1036 mm. The cross-section rotation at the ends is not allowed and the axial load is distributed around the cross-section on the bottom. Residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections were applied according to the authors considerations. Also the geometric imperfections amplitudes from EN1090-2 (CEN, 2008) were tested and compared with the previous values (Table4.2). Initial geometric imperfections were taken into account in the numerical model and their influence evaluated. The values correspond to 80% of geometric fabrication tolerances, following the recommendations from Annex C of Part 1-5 of EC3, and described in section D.1 from Annex D of EN 1090-2+A1.

Table 4.3 presents the results from the experimental test and the numerical analysis obtained from SAFIR software (for the three different models with and without initial imperfections).

Figure 4.2 also presents the load-displacement evolution obtained experimental and numerically for the lipped sigma columns E_240x60x20x(1.5) different analysis.
From Table 4.3 and Figure 4.2 is possible to observe very small differences when comparing the numerical and the experimental tests, where is visible a good agreement between the results. Figure 4.3 shows the numerical model and the corresponded
deformed shape at the collapse instant, with the distortional buckling phenomenon occurrence as occurred at the experimental test (Aghoury et al., 2014).

The numerical models considering the initial imperfections are closer to the numerical results and at the same time are on the safe side. From this analysis, it is possible to
conclude that it is important to consider the initial geometric imperfections on the numerical models to the numerical analysis.
The following research work (Young and Rasmussen, 1998) presents a group of cold-formed steel plain and lipped-channel columns tests under compression action and the strengths compared with the design strengths from determined specifications (Australian, American 1996 specifications).

From Young and Rasmussen (1998) studies, the simple supported lipped-channel elements C_97x48x12x(1.5), reference L48 from the report and steel grade G450, were considered with the 300 mm, 565 mm, 1065 mm and 1565 mm lengths.
Residual stresses were neglected, but the overall geometric imperfection considered of maximum amplitude at mid-span, 1/2800 of the specimen length, according to the authors considerations.
On Table 4.4 are presented the results from the experimental tests and the numerical analysis from SAFIR software for the four different length elements. Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6 also present the load-deflection and load-shortening charts experimental and numerically obtained for the 565 mm length model.

From Figure 4.5, Figure 4.6 and Table 4.4 results is possible to observe differences lower than 5%, where is visible a good numerical validation of the numerical model when compared to the experimental lipped-channel columns at normal temperature.

Once again, at normal temperature, considering all the initial assumptions (type of load and supports applied, measured initial geometric imperfections) leads to a good agreement between the numerical analysis and the experimental test.
4.2.2	Beam-columns
The research of Torabian et al. (2015) presents the structural strength and stability of cold-formed steel lipped-channel beam-columns tests under bending and compression action. Figure 4.8 presents the test setup and an experimental case of the research work.
From de different cases of this research work, C_154x35x11x(1.5) with 305, 610 and 1219 mm length, under major axis bending with an eccentric loading, were considered. For the numerical analysis, residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections taking into account according to CEN (2008) amplitudes to be on the safe side, since no related information was provided by the authors. The results from experimental and numerical analysis, for the different lengths, are presented in Table
4.5.

As it is possible to observe, there is a good agreement between SAFIR results and the experimental test (results and collapse mode/shape). For beam-columns, where the test data is more complex than the test data for beams or columns, the differences on the results are notorious (from 4.3% to 15.9%). Despite this, the results remain very reasonable.
4.3	Elevated temperatures
Recently this type of research has been increasing but there is a small number of elevated temperature tests on cold-formed profiles. Some of the elements analysed in the present chapter were also adopted for the numerical parametric analysis. Experimental tests with zed, sigma and lipped-channel cross-sections elements are presented with some analyses and brief conclusions.
The elevated temperatures were considered uniform throughout the cross-section due to the reduced thickness of the cross-section’s walls.
4.3.1	Columns
The first elevated temperatures research work here analysed (Mesquita et al., 2014) presents an experimental study about cold-formed steel C and Z cross-section columns
behaviour at normal and high temperatures and compared with the ones obtained with the Eurocode simplified models.
From de different cases analysed by Mesquita et al. (2014), the lipped-channel element C_150x51x20x(1.5), reference C17 under ISO834 fire curve and 1000 mm length, was considered. For the numerical analysis, residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections taking into account the CEN (2008) amplitudes, since nothing was mentioned by the authors.
Figure 4.11 presents the fire resistance furnace used for the experimental tests, as well as the applied fire test setup.
Figure 4.11 - Furnace and experimental test setup (Mesquita et al., 2014)
The procedure of the fire test starts with the mechanical load application, representing a degree of use, increasing the load until the expected value and kept constant during the fire action. After, the temperature is applied according to the ISO834 fire curve.
The same procedure was applied on the numerical model with the experimental test data and the FN Annex constitutive law was used. The result from both analyses, experimental and numerical, are presented on Table 4.6 and in Figure 4.12.

The time and temperature values correspond to the values obtained since the furnace was switched on, until the collapse occurrence. From Table 4.6 and in Figure 4.12 is possible to observe differences of almost 13%, which is still a good validation of the numerical model against experimental lipped-channel columns at elevated temperature providing also reasonable similar behaviour during the fire test. Beams
Laim et al. (2016) presented the results of an experimental study about cold-formed steel beams with different cross-section under fire conditions.
From de different cases of this research work, C_250x43x15x(2.5), reference B-C, and E_255x70x25x(2.5), reference B-S, with 3000 mm length were considered. For the numerical analysis, residual stresses were neglected and the geometric imperfections taking into account according to CEN (2008) amplitudes, since no related information was provided by the authors. The fire curve applied during the numerical analysis was the one with the temperatures obtained for each element during the real fire test. Also, the FN Annex constitutive law was used in the present analysis.
Figure 4.14 presents the applied test setup by Laim et al. (2016) research. The test was performed in two stages: first loading and then heating. The maximum load applied was 50% of the design value of the load-bearing capacity of the element at normal temperature. Reached the required load, the element was subjected to the ISO 834 fire curve, maintaining the load constant during the entire fire test.
Figure 4.14 - Beam test setup (Laim et al., 2016)
The results from both analyses, experimental and numerical, and for the different models, are presented in Table 4.7.

From Table 4.7, Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16 is possible to observe a good agreement between both analysis with differences less than 2%, being a good numerical validation of the experimental beams at elevated temperature, with similar element behaviour during the fire test as shown in Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18.

It is possible to create a numerical model with the same characteristics and conditions of a fire experimental test and presenting similar results and behaviours. For being more stable, the sigma element fire test demonstrated to be in a better agreement with the numerical results and behaviour (Figure 4.15 and 4.16 and Table 4.7).
Finally, the last experimental test studied presents cold-formed Z purlins, performed in the Fire testing laboratory PAVUS by the Czech Technical University in Prague, in a
horizontal furnace. The Z purlin is here analysed as it was possible to study in detail the data considered obtained from this test, performed in Prague, where part of the present research work was specifically developed.
The profile tested had a Z section with a height of 200 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm. Different Z profiles were spanned for 6 m, inside the furnace, with an overhanging part (cantilever) of 2.5 mm on one side, outside the furnace (see Figure 4.19).

Figure 4.19 - Template of the tested Z purlin (Jandera and Schwarz, 2014)
The aim of the overhanging part (cantilever) was to simulate an internal support of a continuous beam. A sleeve system was adopted in this connection. Inside the furnace one element was used for the span, outside the furnace for the cantilevered part, and for the connection a thicker element (Z purlin height 200 mm and thickness of 2.0 mm) was interconnecting both elements at the hogging moment area. All sections are S350GD steel grade.
The loads were chosen in order to represent a realistic example of a roof structural element (purlins), based on the ultimate limit state combination, at normal temperatures. The dead weight of a sandwich panel and the snow load representing more than 90% use of the element in normal conditions were considered. This leads to a load of 0.5 kN/m for the member inside the furnace, the load was imposed by attaching it to the web each 1 m of the span length, and a 1 kN at the end of the element outside the furnace was also imposed, at the top of the member.
Comparisons between the imposed heating curve ISO834 (CEN, 2012) and the measured temperature inside the furnace are presented on Figure 4.20. The element temperature was measured with welded thermocouples in three parts (upper flange, web and lower flange) of two different cross-sections (mid-span and at 500 mm from the support) (Figure 4.21). The average temperatures at mid-span and at the support are presented on Figure 4.20.

Figure 4.21 - Thermocouples applied on the element (Jandera and Schwarz, 2014)
According to EN 1363-1 (CEN, 2012), for flexural loaded elements, the failure to support the load occurs when one of the following criteria has been exceeded (Table 4.8):

where $ is the span of the element and d is the distance from the extreme fibre of the cold design compression zone to the extreme fibre of the cold design tension zone of the structural section. However, the rate of the deflection criteria is not applied in the first 10 min of the fire test, since relatively fast deflection can occur until stable conditions are reached. The Z purlin is supported by a pair of U-profiles with four bolts each one. The boundary conditions for the numerical models are presented on Figure 4.22 and
Figure 4.23. The distributed loads were considered as point loads on end points from U-profiles and a point load at the end of the cantilever (Figure 4.24).

Figure 4.25 - Numerical model and respective temperature from the Z purlin adopted for the SAFIR numerical model analysis
The influence of geometrical imperfections and constitutive laws on the numerical model’s behaviour was analysed. The obtained results from the experimental fire test and from the numerical analysis with and without imperfections and considering de different constitutive laws are presented in Figure 4.26.
Figure 4.26 - Deflection-time comparison between experimental and numerical models at mid-span
From Figure 4.26 it is possible to observe the evolution of the deflection from the Z purlin, in function of time, at mid-span. The difference between the numerical model behaviour considering the Annex E or the FN Annex constitutive law after 19 min is notable. The results are closer to the experimental results considering the FN Annex.
Figure 4.27 shows the time of each criteria reached by the experimental and the numerical analysis adopted (considering the FN Annex constitutive law).
Figure 4.27 - Criteria for flexural loaded elements and respective values reached in experimental and numerical tests at mid-span
The first limiting criterion to be reached was the limiting rate of deflection, after 17 min by the experimental fire test and after 22 min by the numerical analysis. As mentioned before, according to EN 1363-1, the rate of the deflection criterion is not applied in the first 10 min of the fire test, since relatively fast deflection can occur until stable conditions are reached as observed at the minute 6 of the fire resistance test. The second limiting criterion was reached by the fire test after 42 min and by the numerical analysis after 59 min.
After 15 min it is possible to observe the lateral-torsional phenomenon occurring (Figure 4.28) before the first criterion reached. Around the 20 min of fire test and 22 min of numerical analysis the phenomenon of catenary action is starting to develop. From Figure 4.29 the Z purlin behaviour is similar to a tensile element (catenary action).

In Figure 4.30 and Figure 4.31 it is visible the deformed shape of the entire element after the fire test and the numerical analysis, and the detailed buckling phenomenon observed next to the support.

Considering the present numerical model, it is visible a good agreement between the numerical analysis and the experimental test, in terms of results and element behaviour.
From this analysis it is concluded that it is possible to create a numerical model with the same characteristics and conditions of a fire experimental test, considering a real common case in the construction.
The numerical model results are always on the safe side. A relatively good agreement between the numerical results and the fire test results was obtained with the adopted numerical model presented in this section.
Considering the FN Annex constitutive law, the results present an approximation to the experimental results. The shape of the numerical model curve is closer to the experimental curve configuration. Also the behaviour of both analyses is very similar. Therefore, it is important to take into account the reduction factors from the FN Annex constitutive law for cold-formed profiles to obtain more realistic results for this type of profiles.
4.4	Final considerations
In this chapter it is presented the numerical modelling of some experimental tests from the literature and from the performed work, and general conclusions were obtained.
From these chapter analyses it is concluded that it is possible to create a numerical model with the same characteristics and conditions of an experimental test, at normal and elevated temperatures.
It is important to consider the initial geometric imperfections on the numerical models, since with this consideration closer results to the experimental tests were obtained. In
Chapter 5 it is going to be analysed which amplitudes for the initial geometric imperfections are better to take into account on the numerical models.
When considering the FN Annex constitutive law in all the fire analysis, the results presented a better approximation to the experimental results. As mentioned before, it is important to take into account the reduction factors from the FN Annex constitutive law for cold-formed profiles to obtain more realistic results for cold-formed steel profiles.
In general, from all the previous analysis, it is visible a good agreement between the numerical analysis and the experimental tests, in terms of results and elements structural behaviour in fire.

5.1	General considerations
Steel structural elements are susceptible to the occurrence of local, distortional and global buckling phenomena. However, depending on the element or cross-section type, these buckling phenomena have different susceptibility to occur.
This chapter presents a parametric study through numerical analyses on the behaviour of simply supported elements, considering different initial imperfections, temperatures, cross-section slendernesses and steel grades. The different case studies chosen for the extended numerical analyses presented in Chapter 6 for code validation are also presented.
On this research, lipped channel cross-sections (C) and sigma sections (S) were studied. These two section types were chosen due to being two of the most common cold-formed shapes applied in construction.
In Chapter 5, three types of members are considered: axially compressed (columns), subjected to bending (beams) and the previous actions combined (beam-columns). The respective numerical models are presented. The different instability modes are represented and the influence of different parameters for model and case study's admeasurement are analysed. For beam-columns, some of the assumptions were taken into account from beams and columns for being a particular situation of both cases combined. Therefore, only the numerical models adopted and the influence of different parameters for case study's admeasurement is analysed.
The purpose of this chapter is to test the consistency of the numerical models in columns, beams and beam-columns.
5.2	Numerical models
In the finite element model, rectangular shell finite elements, with four points of integration on the surface of the element, were used due to the walls high slenderness, to reproduce local buckling phenomena (see Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2).
Loads were applied, in the parallel directions to the element axis, according to the correspondent linear stresses distribution. The restrictions were imposed in order to
reproduce one end pinned support and one roller support (simply supported). It was not considered the increased yield strength, due to the cold formed process, as it is not also considered in EC3 analytical calculations when local/distortional buckling is due to occur. The constitutive law considered was the one prescribed in EN1993-1-2 using its Annex E, for Class 4 cross-sections. The elevated temperatures were considered uniform throughout the cross-section, for an easier comparison with the design formulations proposed in EC3 and due to the reduced thickness of the profile’s walls.
5.2.1	Columns
At columns, concentrated loads were applied in the parallel direction to the lipped channel section columns axis along the whole section according to the linear stresses distribution resulting from compression action. The thickness of the shell elements was increased at the column ends to avoid local buckling instabilities on these parts when loads and restrictions are applied. In Figure 5.1 the numerical model with constraints and loads, at elevated temperatures, is presented.

5.2.2	Beams
Regarding beams loads were applied, in the parallel direction to the lipped channel section beam axis, according to the linear stresses distribution resulting from simple elastic bending around the strong axis, imposing uniform bending diagram in the beams length. In Figure 5.3, the numerical model with constraints and loads at elevated temperatures is presented.

5.2.3	Beam-columns
About beam-columns, loads were applied in the parallel direction to the lipped channel section beam axis, according to the linear stresses distribution resulting from simple elastic bending around the strong axis and the compression action. Beam-columns with and without lateral buckling restrictions are studied.
5.2.3.1	Without lateral torsional buckling
To study beam-columns without the lateral torsional buckling phenomenon restricted is presented in Figure 5.5, for lipped channel cross-sections, the numerical model adopted
for the analysis of this case. The restrictions applied in the corner do not allow the displacements out-of-plan.

5.3	Buckling modes
For a better understanding of the analysed members behaviour, this section presents the critical loads of elastic instability and the correspondent instability modes obtained through numerical analysis for the different elements. A comparison between the numerical results obtained with the CAST3M (CAST3M, 2012) software associated with RUBY (Couto et al., 2013) interface for SAFIR (Franssen, 2005) and the curve corresponded to elastic instability modes obtained with the CUFSM (Schafer and Adany, 2006) software is presented.
5.3.1	Columns
The determined critical loads of elastic instability and the correspondent modes, through numerical analysis carried out at the simply supported columns subjected to normal temperature (Figure 5.9 to Figure 5.12) are here presented. Initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses were not introduced.
For a better understanding of the existing instability modes, Figure 5.9 to Figure 5.12 present a comparative analysis between the instability modes that the lipped channel cross-section profile can suffer when subjected to axial compression. The crosssection’s and element’s shape is also illustrated, selecting different half-wavelength with different results for an easier comprehension of the different obtained results.

It is still possible to observe two different global buckling modes for long lengths: flexural/torsional and only flexural.

The determined critical loads of elastic instability and the correspondent modes, through numerical analysis carried out at the simply supported beams subjected to normal temperature are here presented. In Figure 5.17 to Figure 5.20 comparisons between the numerical results obtained with the CAST3M associated with RUBY and the curve corresponded to elastic instability modes obtained with the CUFSM software are presented.
In Figure 5.17 and Figure 5.18, the different buckling modes based on half-wavelength for the different element lengths are shown: the local buckling for small lengths, the distortional buckling for intermediate lengths and the global buckling for long lengths.

In this case it can be observed the predominance of local buckling on small lengths beams, distortional buckling on intermediate lengths beams and global buckling on long lengths beams.
From the Figure 5.17 to Figure 5.24, it is once again possible to observe a good agreement between the results obtained with the RUBY interface and CUFSM software as concluded for the column elements which helps to stablish the numerical model to be applied in the present thesis.
5.4	Influence of different parameters for model admeasurement
Here is presented the influence of different parameters on the ultimate bearing capacity of the studied members at elevated temperatures considering the numerical models from section 5.3. The different initial imperfections (geometric and material imperfections), the corner enhancement and residual stresses due to the cold-forming processes are here analysed for columns and beams.
The main purpose of this section is to compare the numerical results obtained from SAFIR analysis by varying the different mentioned parameters. The comparison with the EC3 rules is a topic that will be covered in Chapter 6. Therefore, these analyses are presented considering the EN1993-1-2 rules and the Constitutive Law from the respective Annex E only to have a basic possible reference of comparison.
5.4.1	Initial geometric imperfections
Geometric initial imperfections are taken into account in the models analysis. To generate these imperfections, different shapes based on the local, distortional and global buckling modes are used. For that purpose CAST3M and RUBY software are applied, where the lowest Eigen value for each instability mode is considered.
Table 5.1 shows the maximum magnitude for the three buckling modes imperfection considered from different literatures, where h is the height of the web or width of the flange, whichever presents the larger deflection, and L the element length.

Figure 5.28 - Influence of different imperfections combination on lipped channel columns resistance
It is possible to conclude from the previous results that the lower resistance values occur on models which considered imperfections related to EN1090-2 and EN10162 rules. For the numerical models considering Basaglia and Camotim (2011) proposals for magnitude imperfections the results are very high, which means that are less influent on numerical models resistance. Therefore, the EN1090-2 magnitudes are considered on column models to be on the safe side, representing the most critical situation.
For better understanding the influence of the imperfections, the following situations were compared (Figure 5.29):
•	without geometrical imperfections;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to the local buckling mode;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to the distortional buckling mode;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to the global buckling mode;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to combination of the different buckling modes.

columns numerical model
From the chart in Figure 5.29, it is observed that the columns without any imperfections reach higher resistances compared to the ones which take into account the initial imperfections (as expected). It can be noticed the influence of the introduction of different geometrical imperfections. In this particular case, for all slendernesses the analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations, as well as the distortional imperfections. The columns with the combined imperfections give lower resistances than the ones with the separate imperfections.
Figure 5.30 shows the same analysis for sigma cross-section columns S_229x64x20, steel grade S355 and for 500 °C.

Again, from the chart in Figure 5.30, it is observed that the columns without any imperfections reach higher resistances compared to the ones which take into account the initial imperfections.
The influence of the introduction of different geometrical imperfections in sigma crosssection is less obvious when compared to lipped channel cross-section columns. In this particular case, for all slendernesses the analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations.
From this analysis it is possible to conclude that it is important to consider all the initial geometric imperfections on columns for the different analysis.
5.4.1.2	Beams
The same study of the influence of the initial geometric imperfections on the ultimate load bearing capacity is made for cold-formed beams on fire conditions. In addition, the performance of the simple calculation rules prescribed in EN1993-1-2 is also analysed, when compared to the numerical results.
With the purpose of analysing only the member buckling curve and not the crosssection resistance, the last was made equal to the numerically obtained resistant bending moment for a laterally restrained beam (Figure 5.31), and the critical bending moment was also determined numerically with CAST3M software and RUBY interface. The mesh was maintained equally divided to preserve the model continuity.

Figure 5.34 - influence of different global magnitudes on lipped channel beams resistance
Also, according to each reference, the initial imperfections were combined considering EN1993-1-5 prescriptions (Figure 5.35).
Figure 5.35 - influence of different imperfections combination on lipped channel beams resistance
The lower resistance values occur on models which considered imperfections are related to EN1090-2 and EN10162 rules, as also concluded for columns. For the numerical models considering Basaglia &amp;amp; Camotim magnitude imperfections the results are again very high. Therefore, the EN1090-2 magnitudes were also considered on beam models to be on the safe side, representing the most critical situation. For better understanding the influence of the imperfections, the following numerical models situations are analysed (Figure 5.36):
• without geometrical imperfections;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to the local buckling mode;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to the distortional buckling mode;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to the global buckling mode;
•	with geometrical imperfections corresponded to combination of the different buckling modes.

beams numerical model
It can be observed on Figure 5.36 that the imperfections have a big influence on the beams fire resistance. The analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations. The beams with the combined imperfections give lower resistance values than the ones with the separate imperfections. Figure 5.37 shows the same analysis for sigma cross-section beams at 500 °C, S355 steel grade.

Figure 5.37 - Numerical results of the influence of initial imperfections on sigma section beams numerical model
From Figure 5.37 it is possible to conclude that the influence of the introduction of different geometrical imperfections is less obvious when compared to lipped channel cross-section beams. In this particular case, for small and intermediate slendernesses the analysis with local imperfections gives lower ultimate loads when compared with the other simulations and global imperfections for high slendernesses.
From this analysis it is possible to conclude that it is important to consider all the initial geometric imperfections on beams for the different analysis.
5.4.2	Residual stresses
Material imperfections can be presented as residual stresses which normally appear due to fabrication processes. Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) presented different residual stresses values and paterns, depending on the cold-forming process, cold-rolling or press braking, for cold-formed steel lipped channel sections, which values are presented on Table 5.2. The results are distributed by elements where the residual stresses were measured: corner, flange, lip and web.

*Some lips are flame-cut, thus distorting this value. Value not adopted for residual stresses configuration.
An analysis considering the different residual stresses is performed applying the research values of Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) on models with and without initial geometric imperfections. According to the previous research, the lip values were not considered, the web values were applied on internal elements and the flange on external elements (Figure 5.38). Again, comparisons are made for columns and beams.

Figure 5.39 - Numerical results of the influence of residual stresses on lipped channel column numerical models
Some differences are visible on the ultimate bearing critical load for the elements without initial imperfections. As referred by Schafer and Pekoz (1998a) research work, the most critical material imperfection is the flexural type. But, combined with the initial geometric imperfections, the differences observed are minimal, which means that the effect of the residual stresses can be neglected when combined all the initial imperfections. For this reason, the residual stresses were not taken into account for sigma columns, apart from the lack of information of how to consider these ones for this specific cross-section.
5.4.2.2	Beams
The same analysis is performed for lipped channel cross-sections beams. Figure 5.40 shows the results for each residual stress on the different lipped channel beams numerical models.

Some differences are visible on the ultimate load for the elements without initial imperfections. Once again, the flexural residual stresses are the most important. Considering the residual stresses with the worst initial geometric imperfections combinations has a low influence on the ultimate bearing resistances (Figure 5.40), because the ultimate load is extremely affected by all the geometric imperfections and the residual stresses do not have any impact on the resistance values. And once again, the residual stresses were not taken into account for sigma beams.
5.4.3	Corner enhancement
The corner enhancement is one final influence of the fabrication process on the ultimate bearing capacity. According to EN1993-1-3, to consider the corner enhancement on cross-section’s corners due to the cold-forming process the average yield strength fya may be used instead of the basic yield strength fyb.
The average yield strength f@a may be determined from the results of full size tests, or alternatively by calculation using Eq. (5.1):
fya - fyb + (fu f fyb) A—	2	(5.1)
where,
•	Ag is the gross cross-sectional area;
•	k is the numerical coefficient that depends on the type of forming (k — 7 for cold-rolling and k = 5 for other methods of forming - press-braking);
•	n is the number of 90° bends in the cross-section with an internal radius r &amp;lt;5t (fractions of 90° bends should be counted as fractions of n)
•	t is the design core thickness of the steel material before cold-forming.
In this section an analysis considering the different cold-forming processes is performed considering the average yield strength fya instead of the basic yield strength fyb on models with and without initial geometric imperfections. Although, EC3 states that this parameter should not be considered when buckling occurs.

When combined with the initial geometric imperfections the differences are very small, which means that it is possible to neglect the small effects on elements numerical modelling when combined with geometric imperfections.

Figure 5.44 - Numerical results of the influence of corner enhancement on sigma beam models
Similar differences were observed for beams considering the corner enhancement for long slenderness models which are minimal, increasing an insignificant resistance value for small slenderness models. When combined with the initial geometric imperfections the differences are null for intermediate and long slendernesses, which means that it is possible to neglect the small effects on elements numerical modelling when combined with geometric imperfections. The differences are more visible on sigma elements due to the increased folds on the web when compared to lipped channel elements.
This general effect occurs due to the small difference between the average yield strength (fya) and the basic yield strength fy&amp;amp;. Beyond this, EN1993-1-3 refers to consider the increased yield strength due to cold-forming under specific situations (see 3.2.2.(4) and 3.2.2.(5) from EN1993-1-3).
5.5	Influence of different parameters for case study's admeasurement
This section presents the influence of different parameters to be considered on the case studies afterwards. It is presented a numerical study considering different cross-sections slendernesses, temperatures, steel grades and loading types, for beams, columns and beam-columns. After the analysis performed at section 5.4 and the respective conclusions, the initial imperfections considered where the ones from EN 1090-2 (CEN, 2008) and the residual stresses and the corner enhancement were not considered on the following numerical models.
5.5.1	Cross-section slenderness
To study the influence of considering different cross-section slenderness, several crosssections with different dimension values were chosen corresponded to different slenderness values. All the study cases are here analysed for 500 °C and yield strength of 355MPa.
5.5.1.1	Columns
As Figure 5.29 shows the results for a section C_229x64x20, here is presented a section with less slender web (Figure 5.45 shows the results for lipped channel column numerical models with C_155x77x31 cross-section).

Figure 5.30 and Figure 5.46 present results with similar behaviour, as concluded for lipped channel sections.
It can be concluded that sections from the same shape type can present similar behaviour. However, considering different shape types (lipped channel or sigma crosssections), particular differences can be found. In sigma cross-sections, the initial geometric imperfections have less influence than in lipped channel cross-sections. The results for lipped channel sections are lower when compared with sigma section results.

Comparing Figure 5.36 to Figure 5.47 and Figure 5.37 to Figure 5.48 an analogous behaviour is perceptible from the obtained results. From each analysed imperfection, the models with global imperfections present lower resistance values for intermediate to high slendernesses and with local imperfections for small slendernesses. Therefore, it is recommended to analyse each geometric imperfection when a new cross-section is studied.
5.5.1.3	Beam-columns
For beam-columns the analysis is performed for elements without and with the possibility of occurrence of lateral torsional buckling.
5.5.1.3.1	Without lateral torsional buckling
For three different lengths, two cross-sections are compared for lipped channel sections

For this research, the temperatures of 350 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C were adopted, (350 °C being the EC3 proposed critical temperature for thin-walled sections when no calculation is made; 500 °C and 600 °C being the most common critical temperature range in cold-formed steel elements).

From beams study, the obtained normalized results do not present a different behaviour when the temperature in a variable.
5.5.2.3	Beam-columns
For beam-columns the same analysis is performed considering and non-considering the lateral torsional buckling.
5.5.2.3.1	Without lateral torsional buckling
Figure 5.61 and Figure 5.62 show the results for lipped channel and sigma, respectively, beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling, considering the different temperatures analysed.

Figure 5.62 - Influence of different temperatures for E_229x64x20 section beam-column models without lateral torsional buckling, for a) 350 °C, b) 500 °C and c) 600 °C
The results behaviour is analogous considering 350 °C, 500 °C or 600 °C for both lipped channel and sigma cross-sections.

Figure 5.64 - Influence of different temperatures for L_229x64x20 section beam-column models with lateral torsional buckling, for a) 350 °C, b) 500 °C and c) 600 °C
According to the previous cases, the results behaviour is practically the same considering the different high temperatures for both lipped channel and sigma crosssections.
5.5.3	Steel grades
In the present section, the influence of the steel grade, varying the yield strength, was analysed, using the 280, 320, 355 and 460 MPa values. These values present some of the most common commercial values, where 280 MPa is one of the lowest common values and 460 MPa one of the highest values.
5.5.3.1	Columns
Figure 5.65 to Figure 5.67 present the obtained results for 280, 320 and 460 MPa for lipped channel columns, since the results for 355 MPa were already presented before.

From the results analysed, the differences observed are related to the prescribed rules from EC3 that depends on the yield strength value, explanation to the approximation of the results to the EC3 rules increasing this factor.
Figure 5.68 to Figure 5.70 present the obtained results for 280, 320 and 460 MPa for sigma columns, since the results for 355 MPa were also presented before, where the same observation for lipped channel columns is valid for sigma cross-sections columns.

From the results analysed, it is possible to conclude that the influence of the steel grade is minimal. However the steel grade should not be neglected on EC3 rules, as proved before.

Figure 5.74 to Figure 5.76 present the obtained results for 280, 320 and 460 MPa for sigma beams, where the same observation for lipped channel beams is valid for sigma cross-sections beams.

5.5.3.3	Beam-columns
For beam-columns the different yield strength values are tested for lipped channel and sigma cross-sections, for 500 °C and maintaining the same length for a direct possible comparison.
5.5.3.3.1	Without lateral torsional buckling
The results for lipped channel and sigma beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling are respectively presented on Figure 5.77 and Figure 5.78.

From the presented charts the differences visible are small. However, it is recommended to consider the yield stress influence in EC3 rules.
5.5.3.3.2	With lateral torsional buckling
Allowed the lateral torsional buckling, the results for lipped channel and sigma beamcolumns are presented on Figure 5.78 and Figure 5.79 respectively and the conclusions about the results are again the same from the previous analysis.

5.5.4	Bending moment diagram
To evaluate the different loading types it is analysed the same cross-section used to study the influence of the steel grade, C_229x64x20x(1.5), applying different nonuniform bending moments (y ratio 0 and -1). For this case it is used the yield strength of 355 MPa at all numerical models here presented. This study is performed for beams and beam-columns lipped channel and sigma cross-sections.
5.5.4.1	Beams
On beams, for non-uniform bending cases at small lengths members, a failure mode correspondent to shear buckling is observed (see Figure 5.81 and Figure 5.82).
Figure 5.81 - Shear buckling effect observed for y= 0, for a lipped channel section


Figure 5.82 - Shear buckling effect observed for y= -1, for a lipped channel section
As this instability phenomenon is not in the scope of this study, the correspondent values are not taken into account.
From Figure 5.81 and Figure 5.82 it is possible to conclude that the numerical resistance increase significantly for the case of non-uniform bending. This behaviour of LTB is already considered in Part 1-1 of EC3, but not in Part 1-2.
To evaluate the different loading types for sigma cross-sections, the E_229x64x20x(1.5) cross-section is analysed applying different non-uniform bending moments (^ ratio 0 and -1, Figure 5.83 and Figure 5.84).
Figure 5.83 - Results of the sigma beams for y= 0, for a sigma section
In non-uniform bending cases, especially for small length beams with ratio -1, a failure mode corresponding to shear buckling was observed (see Figure 5.84) as happened on lipped channel sections. Once again, this instability phenomenon is not in the scope of this study, therefore the corresponding values are not taken into account.

5.5.4.2	Beam-columns
For beam-columns, the analyses are presented below without and with lateral torsional buckling for lipped channel and sigma cross-sections at 500 °C and f=355MPa.
5.5.4.2.1	Without lateral torsional buckling
For non-uniform bending cases the results are presented on Figure 5.85 for ^=0 and
Figure 5.86 ^= -1 on lipped channel beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling.

Figure 5.87 - Collapse mode of a C_229x64x20 section beam-column model for k = _1 without lateral torsional buckling
The collapse mode presented on Figure 5.87 is obtained from one case of the beamcolumn lipped channel cross-section with ^ = — 1 and without lateral torsional buckling, marked on the previous chart, where different phenomena are visible (local buckling, shear buckling).
Figure 5.88 and Figure 5.89 represent the same analysis for sigma cross-section beamcolumns.
Figure 5.88 - Results of L_229x64x20 section beam-column models for k = 0 without lateral torsional buckling: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.5m and c) L=3.5m
Figure 5.89 - Results of L_229x64x20 section beam-column models for k = without lateral torsional buckling: a) L=1.0m, b) L=2.5m and c) L=3.5m
The results are again higher when considering non-uniform bending k = — 1 and 0.
These differences are important to be taking into account on the EC3 rules.
5.5.4.2.2	With lateral torsional buckling
Considering the lateral torsional buckling phenomenon on lipped channel sections nonuniform bending cases results are presented on Figure 5.90 for k=0 and Figure 5.91 k= -1. Also for sigma cross-sections the analysis is performed on Figure 5.92 and Figure 5.93 for both non-uniform bending diagrams and it is perceptible the importance of considering the different loading situations for each cross-section type.

5.6	Case studies for validation of design proposals
The following study in Chapter 6 presents a numerical analysis of the behaviour of simply supported members with cold-formed lipped channel sections (C) and sigma sections (E), in case of fire. These cold-formed profiles are commonly used in buildings being quite common as roof or walls support elements.
When compared with lipped channel sections, sigma cross-sections normally have advantageous structural features, where the shear centre is closer to the web and an enhanced web buckling resistance is observed.
As can be seen from section 5.5, the influence of the different parameters is important and is therefore taken into account in the parametric study of the Chapter 6. With the present research it is intended to extend the study of these cross-sections to evaluate the EC3 prescriptions.
Three types of elements are presented, such as columns, beams and beam-columns, at elevated temperatures. Due to the mono-symmetrically of these cross-sections studied, the columns case will be an approximation of beam-columns study, due to the shift of centroidal axis of the effective cross-section relative to the gross cross-section.
5.6.1	Columns
The cold-formed lipped channel sections (C) presented on Table 5.3 (some of them already shown at the previous parametric study) were chosen for the numerical analysis of columns, where the comparison between the numerical results and the EC3 rules is presented in Chapter 6.

5.7	Final considerations
At the present section, the numerical models for lipped-channel and sigma crosssections elements (columns, beams and beam-columns) are defined and prepared for the extensive campaign analysis and comparisons with the design rules included in Chapter 6.
For these models, the initial considerations are defined, considering the initial geometric imperfections combined and not taken into account the residual stresses neither the corner enhancement, to analyse the most critical situations.
Therefore, the influence of the different cross-sections, temperatures, steel grades, bending diagrams and lengths is important to analyse in order to get more comprehensive and safe design rules.

6.1	General considerations
A parametric study, with the purpose of analysing the Eurocode design formulae approximation, is performed in this chapter. The numerical analyses are performed to columns, beams and beam-columns. Also, new design methodologies are proposed as the analysis made showed the need of new design adjustments, from previous conclusions. This prediction for the fire design of cold-formed steel members is important because the actual calculation rules seem to be over conservative.
6.2	Columns
In the present section, the adopted column model from Chapter 5 is applied and after obtained the respective resistance values, for different cross-section types (lippedchannel (C) and sigma (E) sections) and different steel grades. New methodologies are analysed and proposed in this section in order to cover as many cases as possible not being over conservative but remaining in the safe side.
Here are presented the different methodologies applied as well as the New Proposals for the different analysis. The applied methodologies are based on the EC3 design rules. The “EN1993-1-2” is referred to the current Part 1-2 of the EC3 general rules, for elements under compression action considering the load eccentricity and the Annex E considerations for Class 4 cross-sections. The “EN1993-1-2 FNA” is referred to the Part 1-2 of the EC3 considering the FN Annex assumptions for cold-formed crosssections. “New Proposals” correspond to the differences applied on the previous Methodologies. “New Proposal a-0,65” is tested for lipped-channel and sigma crosssections and consists on considering the a factor from the EC3 general rules for fire. However, a new proposal is presented (“New Proposal a-0,40”) particularly for sigma cross-sections that presents a better approximation to these numerical results that consists on modifying the constant value from a factor 0,65 to 0,40. Afterwards, a statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the accuracy of the different Methodologies and New Proposals.

Table 6.1 presents the different Methodologies and also the New Proposals for the different case studies.

In “New Proposal a-0,65”, the coefficient for determining the reduction factor from FN Annex is considered and the imperfection factor is obtained applying the imperfection factor expression from Part 1-2 of the EC3. In “New Proposal a-0,40” the imperfection factor remains with a coefficient adjustment only valid for sigma (S) cross-sections. All the main formulation from FN Annex of Part 1-2 from EC3 remains. New Proposals consider the FN Annex Constitutive Law considering the previous analysis and conclusions about the numerical models behaviour (see Chapter 4).

The following results are related to the different lipped channel sections analysed cases. For an easier comparison and analysis, only some cases are presented. The cross-section model also adopted in the Chapter 5, applying intermediate case studies and the respective extremes from the range considered, is shown.

Regardless of considering the numerical results obtained with the Annex E or the FN Annex Constitutive Laws, applying the design rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 (EN1993-1-2), the results are very similar. The same does not happen when for the same numerical results are applied the different methodologies of both annexes.
From Figure 6.3 there are clear differences. The design rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 (EN1993-1-2) are over conservative, but the design rules from the FN Annex of Part 12 of EC3 (EN1993-1-2 FNA) have a range of unsafe results. The New Proposal balances the previous differences where the results are closer to the new curve but on the safe side.
Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5 show the same analysis considering different lipped-channel cross-sections.

From the results shown in Figure 6.3, Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5, on one hand is visible how over conservative are the rules from the EN1993-1-2 for the three cases. The opposite occurs for the rules from EN1993-1-2 FNA, where most of the values are on the unsafe side. The “New Proposal a-0,65” shows a better approximation to the numerical results for any different cross-section’s dimensions.
The following charts consider different steel grades (Figure 6.6 and Figure 6.7).

The influence of the different steel grades is visible. Considering a low steel grade the numerical results are far from the EC3 rules, being the approximation improved when the steel grade increases. The EN1993-1-2 stills being over conservative, but the EN1993-1-2 FNA tends to be increasingly insecure for the results (Figure 6.5, Figure
6.6,	Figure 6.7). New Proposal a-0,65 balances these differences being often on the safe side, where the unsafe results occur for the limit range of steel grade.
The average value (p) and the standard deviation (s) are important values in the statistical analysis for the different methodologies of Part 1-2 from EC3 and different New Proposals that are obtained for each analysis performed.
For each analysed curve it is possible to evaluate the ratio between the analytical value and the corresponding SAFIR value:
Analytical x _ Rult,i Xi _	SAFIR
Rult,i
The average value p is obtained by:
zr=1xj
(6.1)
(6.2)
And the standard deviation s is given by:
s
= Jsr=i(xi- r)2
n- 1
(6.3)
with n, the total number of considered numerical simulations.
The following criteria for validation were considered:
1.	The calculation results shall not be on the unsafe side by more than 15% of the SAFIR results;
2.	A maximum of 20% of individual calculation results is acceptable to be on the unsafe side;
3.	The mean value of all percentage differences between calculation results and SAFIR results shall be on the safe side.
Considering n=330 as the total number of numerical simulations taking into account the Annex E Constitutive Law and other 330 numerical simulations considering the FN Annex Constitutive Law, Table 6.2 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the ratio between the different design rules, analytical approaches and the numerical results for lipped channel sections.
Table 6.2 - Statistical evaluation for lipped channel columns at high temperatures
Design rule	Average value (u)	Standard deviation (s)	Máx. Unsafe	% Unsafe
EN1993-1-2	0.8538	0.0756		0%
(Annex E Constitutive Law)				
EN1993-1-2	0.8556	0.0734		0%
(FN Annex Constitutive Law)				
EN1993-1-2 FNA	1.0339	0.0586	1.15	58%
(FN Annex Constitutive Law)				
New Proposal a-0,65 (FN Annex Constitutive Law)	0.9701	0.0491	1.06	18%
According to the values from Table 6.2, it is possible to observe that the EN1993-1-2 is over conservative with a low average value and without unsafe results. Also, the standard deviation is high. However, the EN1993-1-2 FNA presents a large percentage of non-safety results (58%) despite an average value closer to 1 and a lower standard deviation. The percentage of unsafe results for “New Proposal a-0,65” significantly decreases to 18%. The average value is closer to 1 and with a low standard deviation.
Since the values of the statistical analysis and respective criteria for validation are on the limit of safety, the analysis for “New Proposal a-0,40” does not make any sense. The results for this New Proposal would be too unsafe.
6.2.2.2	Sigma sections (X)
The following results are related to the different sigma sections analysed cases (Figure
6.8	and Figure 6.9). The same procedure and analysis made for lipped channel sections is also here performed. A New Proposal (New Proposal a-0,40) is here analysed, developed specially for this type of cross-section shape (Figure 6.10, Figure 6.11).

grades is visible. The “EN1993-1-2” is over conservative, the “EN1993-1-2 FNA”
presents a significant improvement for the results, being these closer to the curve
(Figure 6.12 and Figure 6.13). Nevertheless, “New Proposal a-0,40” gives a good
approximation to the numerical results guaranteeing the safety required.
Considering n=150 as the total number of numerical simulations for Annex E Constitutive Law and n=150 for FN Annex Constitutive Law, Table 6.3 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the ratio between the different design rules, analytical approaches and the numerical results for sigma sections.
Table 6.3 - Statistical evaluation for sigma columns at high temperatures
Design rule	Average value (u)	Standard deviation (s)	Máx. Unsafe	% Unsafe
EN1993-1-2	0.7606	0.0735		0%
(Annex E Constitutive Law)				
EN1993-1-2	0.7679	0.0703		0%
(FN Annex Constitutive Law)				
EN1993-1-2 FNA	0.9259	0.0394	1.06	3%
(FN Annex Constitutive Law)				
New Proposal a-0,65 (FN Annex Constitutive Law)	0.8472	0.0597	1.05	1%
New Proposal a-0,40 (FN Annex Constitutive Law)	0.9372	0.0374	1.06	9%
According to the Table 6.3 results, it is possible to notice how over conservative the EN1993-1-2 is, with a very low average value. Also, the standard deviation is high. However, the EN1993-1-2 FNA presents a very good agreement with the numerical results, with an average value closer to 1 and a lower standard deviation. With the New Proposal a-0,65, the method remains over conservative. Therefore, the New Proposal a-0,40 shows a better agreement with the numerical results, having an average value closer to 1 and a low standard deviation, despite the not significant increase of unsafe results from 3% to 9% when compared with “EN1993-1-2 FNA”.
In general, the EN1993-1-2 design rules are over conservative and this is visible for both lipped channel and sigma sections, from columns. For sigma cross-sections this difference is more evident. On the other hand, for “EN1993-1-2 FNA” the same does not happens in the same way. The results are closer to the Eurocode curve but are on the unsafe side (in some cases 58% of the numerical results). Therefore, a new methodology is developed to balance those differences, where the results are closer to the Eurocode curve but on the safe side in almost all cases.
Considering different cross-sections types and dimensions, the conclusions of the analysis are the same. For different steel grades it is possible to obtain the same conclusions with the particularity of having an imperfection factor that depends on the yield strength. The numerical results demonstrated the importance of this adjustment which is not very evident but important for the accuracy of the Eurocode curve. With the New Proposal a-0,65, the method remains over conservative for sigma. Therefore, the New Proposal a-0,40 shows a better agreement with the numerical results, with a small increase of unsafe results.
6.3	Beams
In the current chapter section, the adopted beam model is going to be presented and also the respective analysis, for different cross-section types (lipped channel (C) sections and sigma (S) sections), different steel grades a different bending moments diagrams (uniform and non-uniform moments) comparing the results with the actual design rules. As performed for the column elements, new methodologies are analysed and proposed in this part. The different methodologies are studied and New Proposals developed, based on the EC3 design rules, for the different analysis.
The “EN1993-1-2”, in the same way as for the columns, is referred to the current Part 1-2 of the EC3 general rules, for elements under bending action and the Annex E considerations for Class 4 cross-sections. The “EN1993-1-2 FNA” is referred to the Part 1-2 of the EC3 considering the FN Annex considerations for Class 4 or cold-formed cross-sections. “New Proposals” correspond to the differences applied on the previous Methodologies, as referred for columns. After, a statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the accuracy of the different Part 1-2 of the EC3 methodologies and New Proposals.
6.3.1	New simplified calculation proposals
Similar to Table 6.1, Table 6.4 presents the different Methodologies and also the New Proposals for the different beam case studies. New Proposals consider the FN Annex Constitutive Law as already considered for columns.
According to Vila Real et al. (2007), and from previous conclusions, the shape of the moment diagram also affects the value of the lateral-torsional buckling resistance moment. A beneficial effect results from reduced plastic zones connected by variable bending along the beam can be considered at high temperatures, applying a factor f in function of the shape of the bending moment diagram.
Couto et al. (2015) proposed the introduction of a limit value for this factor, in case of Class 4 sections in fire conditions, which improved the results for bi-triangular bending diagrams (y= -1).

To consider the different loading types, a modified reduction factor proposed by the previous researches is also introduced on New Proposals. The coefficient from FN Annex, for determining the reduction factor, is considered and the imperfection factor is obtained applying the imperfection factor expression from Part 1-2 of the EC3 (also at “New Proposal a-0,40” with an adjustment). All the main formulation of Part 1-2 from EC3 remains.
Considering the previous analysis and conclusions about the numerical models behaviour, New Proposals consider the FN Annex Constitutive Law.
6.3.2	Comparisons between numerical results and simplified calculation rules
6.3.2.1	Lipped channel sections (C)
Here are presented the results related to the different lipped channel beam sections analysed. Only some cases are presented taking into account the different ranges adopted for each parameter analysed.
The first chart represents the results and the design methodology corresponded to the Part 1-2 from EC3 considering the Annex E considerations and Constitutive Law (Figure 6.14).
The second chart represents the results and the design methodology corresponded to the Part 1-2 from EC3 considering the FN Annex considerations and the respective Constitutive Law (Figure 6.15).
The results obtained considering the FN Annex Constitutive Law and all the calculations rules presented on Table 6.4 (except the “EN1993-1-2” methodology, as it has also been over conservative in the previous case for columns, not justifying its analysis in the case of beams) are presented and compared in Figure 6.16 and Figure 6.17, considering different cross-section’s dimensions.

On one hand it is possible to observe how conservative the current design rules are from Part 1-2 of EC3 (Figure 6.14). The existence of a plateau in the beginning of the buckling curve is clearly needed (New Proposal a-0,65) but not enough (Figure 6.16 and Figure 6.17). Also, an adjustment on the imperfection factor must be considered (New Proposal a-0,40) where the results demonstrated to be closer.
The following charts consider different steel grades results (Figure 6.18 and Figure

The “EN1993-1-2 FNA” does not contemplate the influence of the yield strength on
the imperfection factor, that shown to be important for a better adjustment between the
results and the buckling curve, as observed with the “New Proposal” considerations
(Figure 6.18, Figure 6.19), where the imperfection factor depends on the yield strength.
The next results are from different bending diagrams (non-uniform bending moments). The application of a modified reduction factor on the design methodology is important, as shown on Figure 6.20 and Figure 6.21. The results are clearly closer to the “New Proposal a-0,40” and on the safe side.

The total number of considered numerical simulations is 510 (k = 255 with the EN1993-1-2 parameters and also n = 255 with the EN1993-1-2 FNA parameters, considered for the statistical evaluation).
Table 6.5 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the ratio between the different design rules, analytical approaches and the numerical results for lipped channel sections.

According to the values presented on Table 6.5, it is possible to observe that the “EN1993-1-2” is over conservative with a low average value and without unsafe results. However, the “EN1993-1-2 FNA” presents better results and only 4% of non-safety results as well as an average value closer to 1.
With the “New Proposal a-0,65”, the percentage of unsafe results decreases to 3%. However, the proposal which follows the current philosophy of the EN1993-1-2 demonstrated to be over conservative. Therefore the “New Proposal a-0,40” was considered and presents similar results when compared with “EN1993-1-2 FNA” where the values are closer to these buckling curves.
Figure 6.23 shows the accuracy of the design prescriptions of EN1993-1-2, EN1993-1-2 FNA and the New Proposals, for a lipped channel sections (C_229x64x20), considering the different bending moment diagrams.

According to the values presented on Table 6.6 and the Figure 6.23, it is possible to observe that the New Proposals are less conservative, with a smaller value of the standard deviation.
6.3.2.2	Sigma sections (X)
The following results are related to the different sigma sections analysed cases. The same procedure and analysis made for lipped channel sections are also here performed. Once again, the first figure shows the results and the design methodology corresponded to Part 1-2 from EC3 taking into account the Annex E considerations and the respective Constitutive Law (Figure 6.24) and the second one shows the analysis performed with the FN Annex Part 1-2 from EC3 Constitutive Law and the respective methodology.

Figure 6.26 and Figure 6.27 present the results obtained considering the FN Annex Constitutive Law from EN1993-1-2, the respective methodology and the different New Proposals.
Analysing the previous results, it is possible to observe that the current design rules (from Part 1-2 of EC3) are even more conservative compared to the lipped channel sections. For intermediate slendernesses the values from the numerical analysis are furthest from the curve. FN Annex buckling curve is closer to these results. Therefore, the New Proposal is needed.

The influence of the yield strength considered in the New Proposal (which is an improvement of the EN1993-1-2 imperfection factor) is fundamental to a better adjustment between the new buckling curve and the numerical results.

Again, considering a modified reduction factor on the design methodology is very important (see Figure 6.30 and Figure 6.31). The results are closer to the New Proposal curves.
Considering the different studied parameters, the results showed a better approximation to this new curve, rendering it not too conservative as the current rules.

Figure 6.33 - Comparison between EN 1993-1-2, the New Methodology and numerical results for a sigma section, considering the different bending moment diagrams
Considering n as the number of numerical simulations (n = 66), Table 6.8 shows the average value and the standard deviation for the ratio between EN 1993-1-2 or New Methodology analytical approaches and the numerical results.

New Proposal a-0,40 (FN Annex Constitutive Law)	0.909	0.052	1.03	10%
According to the values presented on Table 6.8 and Figure 6.33, it is possible to observe that the “New Proposal a-0,65” is safe and less conservative. Despite the percentage of unsafe results for the “New Proposal a-0,40”, this New Proposal is closer to the numerical results obtained.
The “EN1993-1-2” design rules are over conservative and this is visible for both crosssection’s shapes, from beams. For sigma cross-sections this difference is more evident, as also concluded for columns. For “EN1993-1-2 FNA” the curve is really closer to the numerical results, but for non-uniform bending diagrams the curve revels to be over conservative. Therefore, a new methodology is developed to balance the registered differences, where the results are closer to the buckling curve, not always on the safe side.
Considering different cross-sections types, different dimensions and different steel grades, the conclusions of the analysis are the same. For different steel grades it is possible the particularity of having an imperfection factor that depends on the yield strength. The numerical results demonstrated the importance of this adjustment which is quite evident and important for the accuracy of the buckling curve.
With the “New Proposal a-0,65”, the method remains over conservative. Therefore, the “New Proposal a-0,40” shows a better agreement with the numerical results, with low unsafe results.
6.4	Beam-columns
In this section, the adopted beam-column model and the respective analysis with lipped channel and sigma sections are presented. Different temperatures and steel grades are analysed for one case of each cross-section type to understand the element behaviour in function of these parameters. Different loading types considering different bending moment diagrams are also analysed for different slendernesses. The comparison of the results with the actual design rules is also performed, being necessary to develop new design proposals for these elements.
A “New Proposal” was developed for beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling (adjusting the actual tc expression) and considering the lateral torsional buckling (adjusting the current expression). The statistical analysis demonstrates the need of developing and the adoption of this new methodology, which is presented in this section.
6.4.1	New simplified calculation proposals
Considering the New Proposals from columns and beams, presented on 6.2.1 and 6.3.1 respectively, the New Proposal for beam-columns adds new coefficients to determine interaction factors and consequently to obtain less conservative design rules.
The adjustment for beam-columns under fire conditions and without lateral torsional buckling, on the current tc expression, is presented on Figure 6.34 to Figure 6.36 for the different bending moment diagrams. There is shown the evolution of tc in function of the slenderness with the proposed modifications given on Table 6.9. The “Linear (SAFIR)” represents the behaviour of the main values of each parameter analysed by the SAFIR software.
From this analysis, it is possible to observe that the current py is appropriated for the presented numerical results. Since the results for very small lengths and non-uniform bending results are very conservative and due to the lack of different cases, the expression’s limit value is increased from 0,9 to 1,1 as analysed on Figure 6.34 to Figure 6.36 to keep it safe.

From this analysis, it is possible to observe that the current ^y is appropriated for the presented numerical results.

The previous conclusions demonstrated that the shape of the bending diagram affects the value of the element’s resistance. Besides the &amp;lt;factor in function of the shape of the bending moment diagram, the beam-column’s slenderness also changes de interaction curve (M-N) behaviour.

Although the relatively good results for uniform moments, already considering the New Proposals developed for beams and columns, the results for non-uniform moments were not as good as the previous. Therefore, only changing the limit of the coefficients to determining the interaction factors (py) from 0,8 to 1,1, the problem is solved by simplifying the solution and the safety is remained.
The adjustment for beam-columns under fire conditions and with lateral torsional buckling, on the current liw expression, is presented on Figure 6.40 to Figure 6.42, also for the different bending moment diagrams. The evolution of liw in function of the slenderness with the modified propose from Table 6.10 is shown for lipped-channel cross-sections.

Considering the performed beam-columns analysis taking or not taking into account the lateral torsional buckling, all the main formulation from beams and columns “New Proposals” remains, introducing a new my and mLT on the final “New Proposal”. The FN Annex Constitutive Law is also considered in the “New Proposal”.

6.4.2	Comparisons between numerical results and simplified calculation rules without lateral torsional buckling
6.4.2.1	Lipped channel sections (C)
For the lipped channel sections without lateral torsional buckling case, the results are presented bellow considering the different parameters. The first presented results represent the temperature factor, compared with the design methodology corresponded to the Part 1-2 from EC3, considering the Annex E Constitutive Law (Figure 6.46).
Since these are not buckling curves because there is a case of axial compression combined with a bending moment (due to the mono-symmetric cross-sections geometry), the charts Eurocode curves always start at 1 on the y-axis. Also, because there is no lateral torsional buckling, the kLT will always be equal to 1 and therefore the same chart ends in 1 on the x-axis.

To compare the previous results with the different methodologies here analysed, Figure
6.47 and Figure 6.48 present respectively the results taken into account the FN Annex and the New Proposal.

Also, the study about the steel grade influence is presented in Figure 6.49 and Figure
6.50 for the different methodologies that consider the FN Annex Constitutive Law.

The presented results show the differences between the different methodologies. The general rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 are one more time conservatives as visible in (Figure 6.46) and for all the different parameters analysed (as presented in Chapter 5).
The FN Annex presents an improvement as presented on Figure 6.47 and Figure 6.49 but the interaction curve seems to be inadequate. Otherwise, if considered the assumptions of the New Proposals for beams and columns are taken into account with the shape of the curve of the general calculation rules the results revealed to be closer to the new interaction curve (see Figure 6.48 and Figure 6.50).
For different lengths the results with the FN Annex are also presented and compared with the results considering the New Proposal on Figure 6.51 and Figure 6.52.
Figure 6.51 - EN1993-1-2 FNA results with FN Annex Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling for different lengths: a) L=3.0m, b) L=5.0m and c) L=10.0m

The New Proposal has a better behaviour according to the numerical results, but sometimes still being conservative (increasing the element length). The results are also safer when compared with the FN Annex results.
For non-uniform bending moments, the results represent the values for y=0 and for
Y= -1 on Figure 6.53 to Figure 6.56.

New Proposal curve is better adjusted to the numerical results as it is possible to observe. For very small lengths the New Proposal continues to be very conservative. For superior lengths the curve has a better behaviour, closer to the numerical results and at the same time on the safe side. The buckling curve shape from the FN Annex, due to consider the k equal to 1, is not the most recommended. The statistical analysis is performed and the results of the average value, standard deviation and unsafe values are presented on Table 6.11 for uniform bending moments and on Table 6.12 for the different bending diagrams.

According to the values presented on Table 6.11 and Table 6.12, it is possible to observe that the “New Proposal” is safe and less conservative.
The “EN1993-1-2” is over conservative, especially for non-uniform bending diagrams. For “EN1993-1-2 FNA” the rules are closer to the numerical results, but for small steel grades and high slendernesses some of the results are on the unsafe part. Therefore, a new methodology is considered to adapt the shape of the interaction M-N curves to the numerical results behaviour, depending on the slenderness of the elements, the steel grade and on the bending diagram. The New Proposal presents the best agreement with the numerical results, providing at the same time safety.
6.4.2.2	Sigma sections (X)
In this case, the study of beam-columns without lateral torsional buckling is performed for sigma cross-section analysing the same parameters as analysed for lipped-channel sections. The results from Figure 6.57 are the results of the numerical analysis considering the Annex E Constitutive Law and the comparison with the current Part 1-2 from EC3 interaction curve.

The FN Annex from Part 1-2 of EC3 interaction curve is analysed (Figure 6.58) as well as the New Proposal (Figure 6.59) for different temperatures.

Analysing different steel grades, Figure 6.60 and Figure 6.61 present the influence of this parameter for both methodologies (FN Annex and New Proposal).

The current design rules continue to demonstrate to be conservative and the FN Annex curve does not present a similar behaviour closer to the corresponding numerical results. New Proposal adopted for lipped-channel sections seems to agree with this analysis results. However, some of the values are on the unsafe side.
Varying the element length, the results are showed in Figure 6.62 and Figure 6.63.

With FN Annex methodology the results are clearly on the unsafe side (Figure 6.62). New Proposal presents a good agreement between the numerical results and the proposed interaction curve (Figure 6.63).

Once again, the New Proposal revealed to be the most practical methodology with a relatively good agreement with the numerical results. FN Annex is over conservative as the current design rules is. On Table 6.13 and Table 6.14, there are the statistical analysis for these results.

For sigma beam-columns sections is possible to observe that the “New Proposal” interaction curve is less conservative and still safe, despite some insecure values. “EN1993-1-2 FNA” curve provides a high number of insecure values (35%), also with very high average values. Therefore the “New Proposal” is in better agreement with the results. Comparing the results from sigma sections and lipped-channel sections, the new interaction curve presents better results for lipped-channel sections.
6.4.3	Comparisons between numerical results and simplified calculation rules with lateral torsional buckling
6.4.3.1	Lipped channel sections (C)
For lipped channel beam-columns sections, considering the lateral buckling effect, the results are here presented for the different analysed parameters. As previous presented, the first charts represent the results and the design methodology corresponded to the Part 1-2 from EC3, considering the Annex E Constitutive Law (Figure 6.68) and for different temperatures. For these cases, there is still a case of axial compression combined with a bending moment (due to the mono-symmetric cross-sections geometry), so the charts Eurocode curves always start at 1 on the y-axis. But, considering the lateral torsional buckling, the kLT depends on the element slenderness and will vary the value on the x-axis.
Figure 6.68 - EN1993-1-2 results with EN 1993-1-2 Annex E Constitutive Law for C_229x64x20x(1.5) beam-columns with 1,5 m length and for high temperatures a) 350 °C, b) 500 °C and c) 600 °C
The following charts represent the results and the design methodology corresponded to
the Part 1-2 from EC3 considering the FN Annex considerations and the respective
Constitutive Law (Figure 6.69).

And on the charts from Figure 6.70 are revealed the results considering the New Proposal.

From the results presented above, the analyses show how over conservative the current design rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 are (Figure 6.68). As mentioned before, the FN Annex presents numerical results closer (Figure 6.69) but in some cases on the unsafe side. Therefore, considering all the considerations taken into account so far it is possible to obtain results less conservative than the current Part 1-2 of EC3 curve but on the safe side in general (Figure 6.70).
For different beam-columns lengths the results considering the FN Annex (Figure 6.71) are also presented and compared with the results considering the New Proposal (Figure 6.72).

From Figure 6.71 and Figure 6.72 is visible how the New Proposal has a better behaviour according to the numerical results. The results are safer, when compared with the FN Annex results (see a) from Figure 6.71 and Figure 6.72), and at the same time the shape of the curve is better adjusted (compare b) from Figure 6.71 and Figure 6.72).
Also from different bending diagrams (non-uniform bending moments) the results are analysed (Figure 6.73 to Figure 6.76).

The results are closer to the New Proposal curves. As it is possible to observe, for very small lengths the New Proposal continues to be very conservative. However, these small lengths are not very common in real cases. For common lengths the curve has a better behaviour, closer to the numerical results and at the same time on the safe side.
The statistical analysis presented on Table 6.15 and Table 6.16 proves the last mentioned conclusion.

In general, the New Proposal presents a good agreement (better than the current design rules and the rules from the FN Annex). The New Proposal is a good improvement of both Eurocode rules from the different annexes.
6.4.3.2	Sigma sections (E)
As performed for lipped channel beam-columns sections, the same study for sigma sections was performed considering the lateral-torsional buckling.
Figure 6.77 presents the results as well as the Part 1-2 from EC3, considering the Annex E Constitutive Law, design methodology for different temperatures. Also Figure 6.78 presents the results but considering the FN Annex and the respective constitutive law for the numerical analysis.

The analyses continue to show how over conservative the current design rules from Part 1-2 of EC3 are. The FN Annex presents numerical results really closer. Therefore, considering all the considerations taken into account so far for the New Proposal it is possible to obtain results less conservative than the current Part 1-2 of EC3 curve but on the safe side in general as well as the FN Annex Methodology.
The steel grade is also one of the analysed parameters. The different steel grades results are presented on Figure 6.80 considering the FN Annex and the respective constitutive law and compared with the results considering the New Proposal (Figure 6.81).
As concluded before for lipped channel cross-sections, the current Part 1-2 of EC3 presents a very conservative solution. Again, the FN Annex demonstrated a very good correlation between the numerical results and the analytical expressions, although for other cases (as will be demonstrated) the FN Annex does not continue this correlation.

For the different lengths are presented the comparison for different sigma crosssection's lengths (Figure 6.82) and the New Proposal results (Figure 6.83).

From Figure 6.79, Figure 6.81 and Figure 6.83 is visible how the New Proposal has a very good behaviour accompanying the numerical results.
Also, from different bending diagrams (non-uniform bending moments) the results are analysed (Figure 6.84 to Figure 6.87) for three different lengths.

The results are closer to the New Proposal curves. As it is possible to observe from the non-linear bending moment diagram analysis, for very small lengths the New Proposal continues to be very conservative. The results are not as close as the lipped channel section results from the New Proposal curve in the present case but they are on the safe side as the presented at the statistical analysis of Table 6.17 and Table 6.18.

6.5	Final considerations
A comparison between the ultimate loads and the formulae prescribed in EC3 was performed.
The calculation rules are on the safe side and sometimes too conservative. It was possible to observe that the FN Annex is less conservative than the Annex E, having the first a better agreement with the numerical results.
New methodologies for the design of cold-formed steel members were presented. These proposals were developed to introduce the minimum changes in the existing formulae providing at the same time safety and accuracy when compared to the numerical results.
It is possible to conclude that the current Eurocode design rules for fire conditions, considering the Annex E, are very conservatives. The FN Annex design rules present in some cases a really good approximation to the numerical results, but a shape not adequate to them, being sometimes over conservatives and other times unsafe, due to the simplicity and simplifications that are allowed by the rules for cold-formed steel members.

7.1	Conclusions
The performed work in the present thesis had the concern to study and deepen the knowledge about cold-formed steel structural members developing simplified design methodologies for lipped-channel and sigma cross-sections in case of fire.
First, it was performed an introduction to cold-formed profiles behaviour at fire conditions, addressing fundamental concepts about structural stability of cold-formed steel elements.
A numerical study on the behaviour of different cold-formed steel elements was presented. The numerical models were created based on experimental tests performed by different authors.
From the experimental tests numerical modelling it was concluded that it is important to consider the real imperfections of the cold-formed elements. However, since is not always possible to measure the real initial geometric imperfections, for practical reasons the geometric imperfections magnitudes from the EN1090-2 tolerances should be considered to be always on the safe side.
The more complex the structural setup is, more difficult is to create a more realistic numerical model. It is important to consider as many experimental information as possible, being reasonable to not introduce too much entropy into the model analysis.
For elevated temperatures the differences between the numerical and the experimental tests increased. Considering more variables on a numerical analysis increases the differences.
Considering the FN Annex constitutive law for the numerical simulations of cold-formed steel profiles, it provides better results when compared with the results analysed with the constitutive law of EN1993-1-2 and respective Annex E. The numerical results and the member's fire behaviour are more realistic when making this consideration.
In the end, it was observed a good correlation between the experimental and numerical results, validating the numerical model applied in this study.
The obtained results at normal temperatures, for the determination of elastic instability critical loads and modes shape, were compared using FEM analysis with CAST3M and RUBY interface with those obtained by FSM through CUFSM.
An extensive parametric study of the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of simply supported members with cold-formed sections in case of fire was performed, considering the influence of different temperatures, steel grades, cross-section slenderness and loading types.
From this analysis is notorious the big influence the geometric imperfections have on the members fire resistance. It is important to consider all the geometric imperfections combined.
The imperfections are variable for different cross-sections, member types, loading types and for different boundary conditions. Therefore, a previous analysis must be done to consider each imperfection and combination.
The influence of the residual stresses is low at high temperatures and minimal when combined with the geometric imperfections. Flexural residual stresses revealed to be the most influent when compared with the membrane residual stresses. Nevertheless, both can be neglected for the numerical analysis.
The corner enhancement does not have a considerable impact on cold-formed members resistance. The Eurocode suggests the consideration of this improvement only for specific situations. Therefore, it is not relevant to take into account this parameter on cold-formed numerical models.
Each cross-section member presents different resistance values. The behaviour between sections with the same shape is always similar, but one type shows their particular behaviour. However, it is always recommended to analyse and study each cross-section behaviour.
Performing the analysis of cold-formed profiles for different temperatures, the members behaviour is similar and the same conclusions can be obtained.
The steel grade is a parameter that should be taken into account on EC3 buckling curves. There are small differences but it should be considered for a better approximation between the numerical results and the Eurocode curves.
Considering different bending moment diagrams for non-uniform bending moments the numerical resistance increases significantly. Therefore, different loading types must be analysed separately. An analytical factor is needed on EC3 design rules for considering these different cases.
A comparison between the members ultimate loads and the formulae prescribed in EC3 was performed, concluding that the calculation rules are on the safe side and sometimes too conservative. It was possible to observe that the FN Annex is less conservative than the Annex E, having the first a better agreement with the numerical results.
New methodologies for the design of cold-formed steel columns, beams and beamcolumns were presented. These proposals were developed to introduce the minimum changes in the existing formulae providing at the same time safety and accuracy when compared to the numerical results.
From the columns analysis, the EN1993-1-2 design rules demonstrated to be in general over conservative. The differences for sigma cross-sections are more evident than for lipped-channel sections. In opposition, the EN1993-1-2 FN Annex design rules are in a better agreement with the numerical results. However, there are many cases that are on the unsafe region. In order to find a balance between the two design rules, New Proposals were developed. The “New Proposals” present an adaptation of the previous rules in order to maintain the same assumptions/principles and not creating big changes, but covering a greater number of cases in a less conservative way while maintaining safety.
From beams analysis, the EN1993-1-2 design rules are also over conservative for both lipped-channel and sigma sections, as concluded for columns. The EN1993-1-2 FN Annex design rules are closer to the numerical results but for non-uniform bending diagrams the curve is over conservative. Taking advantage of the principles from the “New Proposals” of columns, the new rules for beams reduce these differences.
From beam-columns analysis, the EN1993-1-2 curves are visibly over conservatives, especially for the cases where the lateral torsion buckling is allowed. The EN1993-1-2 FN Annex design rules present a significant improvement for simple and general cases. However, the shape of the interaction curve looks very inadequate and sometimes not functional, displaying results completely out of the safe domain. Considering the “New
Proposals” for beams and columns, there is a big change on the proximity of the results to these curves. Nevertheless, performing an arrangement on the coefficients to determining the interaction factor is going to adapt the shape of these curves to the results layout. Even so, there are some over conservative curves for small lengths. Because the sample of numerical results was not large enough as desired, it was preferred to play on the safe side and maintain the adjustments at this level.
In general, it is possible to conclude that the current EN1993-1-2 design rules, considering the Annex E, are very conservatives. The FN Annex design rules present in some cases a really good approximation to the numerical results, but a shape not adequate to them, being sometimes over conservatives and other times unsafe, due to the simplicity and simplifications that are allowed for cold-formed steel members.
The New Methodologies are in some way easy to apply and they follow the same philosophy of the Eurocode rules. The results are closer to these curves and the respective shape and behaviour follow the same provision of the numerical results.
7.2	Future work
The present section describes possible future works on research that demonstrated to be necessary during all these works, on the behaviour of cold-formed profiles on fire conditions.
Experimental tests should be performed, particularly for beam-columns at elevated temperatures, since no results were found on literature. The numerical simulations performed were developed based on of columns and beams assumptions, but beamcolumns have a particular behaviour that should be experimentally studied. Also, experimental tests to evaluate the behaviour of the residual stresses on different crosssection types should be performed.
To validate the New Proposals, more numerical analyses are recommended for different cross-sections types (Z and Q), for more loading types (other bending moment diagrams), considering also the bending action around the weak axis.
Also, the distortional buckling as common problem on cold-formed profiles with end and intermediate stiffeners is an important phenomenon to study. The distortional
buckling of these profiles under fire should be deeply analysed, which is determinant for a complete understanding of the cold-formed members behaviour.
Catenary action is also another effect that should be analysed. On fire situation, this phenomenon is very common on beams and to study these advantages for the building safety should be important. Purlins are a typical case of a secondary structural element where it is foreseeable the occurrence of a different phenomenon in fire conditions with the influence of the steel sheeting.
