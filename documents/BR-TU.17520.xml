Abstract
In this work the failure mechanism of flexural buckling that occurred in Pau 

Branco Mine, of Vallourec &amp;amp; Mannesman Group, in 2002, was studied through the 
finite element method. The software Phase2, from Rocscience Inc. was employed in 
the analyses. Despite being a method applicable to continuous rock masses, disconti-
nuities may be included in the model using joint elements. Modeling is simpler, avoid-
ing the difficulties of using distinct element methods, due to the relative complexity 
of the geological section examined, where it was necessary to represent the variability 
of the foliation attitude, due to the pattern of the observed folds. The consideration 
of this variability was essential to reproduce buckling failure. Back analyses of failure 
mechanism were done, leading to representative values of the in situ stress state and 
the normal and shear stiffness modulus of the foliation discontinuities. The param-
eters generated by the analyses are extremely useful for further stability analyses in the 
phyllite slopes of Pau Branco Mine.     

Keywords: failure mechanism, flexural buckling, mining slope stability, stress-strain 
analyses

Resumo
Nesse trabalho, o mecanismo de ruptura por flambagem flexural ocorrido na 

Mina Pau Branco, do Grupo Vallourec &amp;amp; Mannesman, em 2002, foi estudado a partir 
da aplicação de modelagem numérica por elementos finitos. O programa Phase2, da 
Rocscience Inc., foi empregado nas análises. Apesar de ser um método aplicável a ma-
ciços contínuos, as descontinuidades podem ser incluídas no modelo, utilizando-se ele-
mentos de juntas. A modelagem é mais simples, evitando-se as dificuldades de utiliza-
ção de um modelo de elementos distintos, devido à relativa complexidade geológica da 
seção analisada, onde foi necessário representar a variabilidade da atitude da foliação, 
devido ao padrão de dobramentos observado. A consideração dessa variabilidade de 
atitude foi essencial para reproduzir a ruptura por flambagem. Foram feitas retroanáli-
ses do mecanismo de ruptura, obtendo-se valores representativos do estado de tensões 
in situ e dos módulos de rigidez normal e cisalhante das descontinuidades de foliação. 
Os parâmetros gerados pelas análises são extremamente úteis para futuras análises de 
estabilidade nos taludes de filito da Mina Pau Branco. Além disso, o trabalho também 
serve de referência para estudos futuros de flambagem flexural, já que são muito raros 
os trabalhos envolvendo a modelagem numérica desse mecanismo.

Palavras-chave: Mecanismo de ruptura, flambagem flexural, estabilidade de taludes de 
mina, análises tensão-deformação.

Numerical modeling of buckling in a mine slope

1. Introduction

Rock masses of weak metamor-
phic rocks associated to the presence of 
intense tectonic activity are propitious 
to many failure modes in slopes. In 
some cases these rock masses behave 
as pseudo-continuum or equivalent 
continuum, especially if the alteration 
grade is high. However, even with high 
alteration grade, these rock masses 
present preserved geologic structures 
that can result in structural controlled 
failure mechanisms. Another possibil-
ity is the occurrence of hybrid failure 
mechanisms involving intact rock 
and discontinuities. In slope mines, 
especially in high ones, failure mecha-

nisms are associated with considerable 
deformation, requiring a stress-strain 
analysis to provide the correct under-
standing and representation of the 
failure process.

Sjöberg (2000) discusses many 
possible failure mechanisms in large-
scale rock slope mines. This author 
presents a comprehensive literature 
review on failure mechanisms in mine 
slopes, which focused on the author’s 
understanding and analysis of physi-
cal process involved. Some of these 
mechanisms are studied by Sjöberg 
(2000) through numerical analysis. 
One of the mechanisms presented by 

Sjöberg (2000) that has received little 
attention in the literature is buckling. 
This author describes this mechanism 
and presents kinematic conditions for 
its occurrence. 

Cavers (1981) was one of the few 
authors to study the buckling failure 
mechanism in slopes. In his work he 
discusses the flexural and the three-
hinge buckling failure mechanisms 
(see Figure 1).

In Cavers’ work (1981) simplified 
models for buckling and three-hinge 
buckling are proposed. In the case of 
flexural buckling, linear elastic behav-
ior is assumed for the buckling column. 

Figure 1
Buckling failure mechanism: (a) flexure 
buckling; (b) three-hinge buckling (after 
Cavers, 1981).

Cavers (1981) proposed a critical height 
for the occurrence of flexural buckling, 
based on Euler’s theory. 

 In case of three-hinge buckling, 
rock blocks are considered rigid. Cav-
ers’ proposal is based on limit equilib-
rium methods.

Perhaps, due to arbitrary simplifi-
cations assumed by Cavers (1981), his 
models do not yield coherent results 
neither for flexural nor for three-hinge 
buckling failure in phyllite slope mines.

 Adhikary et. al. (2001) discuss 
the occurrence of toppling and buckling 
flexural mechanisms in foliated rock 
masses, focusing their occurrence in 
slope mines (see Figure 2).

   Based on numerical models, 
Adhikary et. al. (2001) also proposed 
a critical height to the occurrence of 
flexural buckling in large-scale rock 
slopes, subject to larger deformations. 
Their results contradicted Cavers’ 
model (1981). 

In Quadrilátero Ferrífero (MG, 
Brazil), a region of rich mineral depos-
its of iron and gold, the occurrence of 
buckling was observed in two slope 
mines, in Córrego do Sítio mine (Santa 
Bárbara) and in Pau Branco mine (Al-
phaville), as showed in Figures 3 and 
4. In both cases, failure occurred in 
phyllite slopes.

In the Córrego do Sítio gold mine 
buckling occurred as a local failure 
mechanism in a bench slope (see Figure 

Figure 2 
Failure mechanisms in foliated rock 
slopes: (a) flexural toppling; (b) flexural 
buckling   (after Adhikary et al., 2001).

3). Lopes (2006) demonstrated that 
this failure mode has had no influence 
in global slope stability. This author 
studied a major failure occurrence in 
the slope of Figure 3 through numeri-
cal analysis; the results showed that 

the mechanism was a circular one com-
bined with plane shear failure. 

 In Pau Branco iron mine buckling 
failure reached many benches of phyllite 
rock slope (see Figure 4). This failure is 
studied in this work through numerical 

models to permit the comprehension 
of the failure process. Also the carry-
ing load conditions involved and the 
strength and deformability parameters 
of the rock mass and discontinuities 
were determined by back-analysis.

The Pau Branco Mine, belonging 
to the Vallourec &amp;amp; Mannesman Group, 
an open pit iron ore mine, lies appro-
ximately 23 km from Brumadinho city. 
Its access is done by the BR-040, 30 km 

from Belo Horizonte, the State capital 
of Minas Gerais. 

The region is in the southwestern 
portion of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero. 
The ore exploited in the Pau Branco 

Mine is among the richest in the world, 
due to the privileged location of the ex-
traction zone, in Moeda Sierra, in the 
western flank of Moeda Synclyne. The 
company extracts and processes three

types of iron mines: hematite, goethite 
and itabirite.

The Pau Branco Mine rocks be-
longs to the Itabira and Caraça Groups, 
Minas Supergroup, and the mineralized 
zone is situated in the Cauê Formation, 
overlaid by the phyllite of Batatal For-

mation.
The general direction of this zone 

is NNW-SSE; the layers dipping to SE 
with an average dip around 45º, varying 
between 35º to 70º (Scarpelli, 1994).

These changes are due to secon-
dary folds, associated with the main 

folding event, N-S. A second folding 
event, with axis nearly perpendicular 
to the major one, E-W, seems to be res-
ponsible for the winding pattern of the 
layers and for relatively abrupt changes 
in the general strike of foliation (Figure 
5).

West Slope. 

Numerical model features 

Buckling failure occurred as a glo-
bal failure mechanism, affecting many 
benches. Large deformations were ob-
served; see Figure 4. A stress-strain 
analysis is the best method for evalua-
ting slopes affected by this mechanism 
because it considers the deformations of 
the rock mass.

The finite element method was 
chosen to study the failure mode oc-
curred in the West Slope of Pau Branco 
Mine. The software Phase2, Rocscience 
(Canada), was used in the analyses. 

Stress- strain analyses permitted 
the back-analysis of the failure mode. 
The main goals of the analyses were a 
better understanding of the phenome-
non, as well as the calibration of rock 
mass geomechanical parameters. 

Buckling failure occurred in 2002, 
affecting many benches. A geological 
preliminary model to understand the 
phenomenon, proposed by a consul-
ting company (BVP Engenharia, 2007), 
was used in the analyses. This model is 
represented by a typical geological sec-

tion, see Figure 6. The foliation trace 
of the rock mass in Figure 6 shows the 
dip variability of this structure, due to 
folding, as described earlier and already 
illustrated in Figure 5.

Folding of the foliation, with the 
consequent verticalization of this struc-
ture creates the favorable kinematic 
conditions for buckling occurrence. 
Due to impact of the failure, it has been 
mandatory to maintain a hematite por-
tion below the dolomitic phyllite to con-
tinue safe mining.

3. Results and discussion

The simplified geological model 
used in the analyses is presented in Figure 
7, with the finite element mesh generated 
in Phase2. Foliation discontinuities were 
explicitly inserted in the model, using 
joint elements, only in buckling occur-

rence region to decrease computational 
effort. A discontinuity spacing of 1m was 
used in the analysis to represent the ob-
served spacing of layers affected by bu-
ckling in 2007. The discontinuities in the 
superior portion of the model have a dip 

value of 60°, which gradually increases 
to 80° in the inferior part of the model, 
to represent the folding of the foliation 
(Figure 6).

The mesh definition was obtained 
through trial and error. The discretiza-

The model was calibrated using 
displacement values described in BVP 

Engenharia report (2007), as well as re-
gion the occurrence of tension cracks in 
an extension of 400 to 500m beyond the 
slope crest, also according to the report 
of BVP. In situ stresses found through 
back-analyses yielded a value of k equal 

to 1, where k is the ratio between hori-
zontal and vertical in situ stresses. She-
ar and normal discontinuity stiffness, 
also obtained through back-analyses 
were ks=5MPa/m and kn=50MPa/m.

tions should be increased significantly 
along joint elements region to assure 
the results were not mesh-dependent.

Boundary conditions in terms 
of displacements were taken for the 
analyses, see Figure 7. Displacements 
are fixed in x direction along lateral 
boundaries of the model and fixed in y 
direction along the bottom boundary. 

Gravitational effects were introduced 
in the model, so stresses vary with dep-
th.

The Mohr Coulomb constitutive 
plastic model was used in the analyses. 
Strength and deformability properties 
were obtained from internal reports of 
Pau Branco Mine. Mohr-Coulomb slip 
joint criterion was used for the discon-

tinuities. Shear strength discontinuity 
properties were also obtained from in-
ternal mine reports.  

Shear and normal stiffness of dis-
continuities were calibrated by back-
analyses. Initial values of joint stiffness 
were calculated according to the follo-
wing expressions from Barton &amp;amp; Chou-
bey (1977) and Bandis et al. (1983):

in Figure 8, which shows the deformed 
boundaries of discontinuities. A scale 
factor to increase the size of deformed 
boundaries was used to allow the vi-
sualization of the model deformation 
mode. Buckling failure affected many 

benches, so it could be interpreted as 
a global model failure; it is clear from 
Figure 8.

Yielded elements in the model are 
shown in Figure 9. Tension crack occur-
rences are observed along the slope top, 

in the whole extension of the model, as 
described in BVP Engenharia report 
(2007). Yielded region is located main-
ly in the discontinuity region, showing 
their importance in slope failure mode.

Numerical modeling of buckling in a mine slope

REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(1), 81-86, jan. mar. | 2014

The numerical modeling of bu-
ckling failure in Pau Branco Mine was 
very useful for the estimation of geome-
chanical parameters of the rock mass 
and the discontinuities.

Folding pattern of the foliation 
with consequent verticalization of this 
structure creates the kinematic favora-
ble conditions of buckling failure. The 

representation of this pattern in the 
model was fundamental to obtain con-
sistent results. On the other hand, the 
model achieves great complexity and 
convergence is reached after a large 
number of interactions. A small chan-
ge in the input data can cause collapse 
of the model. If the discontinuities are 
removed from the model, displacements 

decrease considerably; the collapse risk 
is smaller and there in no formation of 
tension cracks in the slope top.

The use of a numerical model for 
discontinuous rock masses, as the dis-
tinct element method, would be of great 
interest to refine this study and to im-
prove the understanding of the failure 
mode.
