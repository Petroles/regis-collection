ABSTRACT: Change on substrate bulk density during the growing period may negatively affect other substrate
physical properties and, consequently, plant growth. The objectives of this research were 1) to characterize
physical properties of two horticultural substrates (S1 and S2), 2) to evaluate the effect of different bulk
densities values of those substrates on their air/water relationship, and 3) to develop mathematical functions
to estimate the air/water relationship by increasing substrates bulk density value. First, the distribution of
particles size, the bulk density, and the water release curve of the substrates were determined. Then, substrates
were packed with three different bulk density values, i.e. 10% (D1), 20% (D2) and 30% (D3), higher than the
bulk density (D) determined in the characterization phase. The water release curves were determined for each
bulk density value of both substrates. The effect of increasing substrate bulk density in the total porosity
(TP), aeration space (AS), available water (AW), easily available water (EAW), buffering water (BW), and
in the remaining water (RW) was evaluated using simple linear regression and polynomial analysis. The
particles size distribution and the water release curves were significantly different for the two substrates.
Increasing the bulk density value decreased TP and AS, and increased BW and RW. The highest values of AW
and EAW were observed for D1. Regression equations obtained can be used to choose the more appropriate
air/water relationship for each growing condition.
Key words: particle size distribution, substrate bulk density, water release curve, regression equation

DENSIDADE E RELAÇÃO AR/ÁGUA DE
SUBSTRATOS HORTÍCOLAS

RESUMO: Alterações na densidade do substrato durante o cultivo das plantas modificam suas propriedades
físicas. O trabalho teve como objetivos caracterizar fisicamente dois substratos hortícolas e avaliar o efeito da
densidade na relação ar/água dos mesmos, elaborando funções matemáticas que permitam estimar tal relação a
partir da densidade do substrato. Para tanto, determinou-se a distribuição do tamanho das partículas, a densidade
e a curva de retenção de água. Procedeu-se o acondicionamento dos substratos em três valores de densidade: 10
(D1), 20 (D2) e 30% (D3) maior que a densidade (D) determinada na fase de caracterização. Partindo das amostras
com diferentes densidades, determinou-se a curva de retenção de água dos substratos. A influência do aumento
da densidade do substrato na porosidade total (PT), no espaço de aeração (EA), na água disponível (AD), na
água facilmente disponível (AFD), na água tamponante (AT) e na água remanescente (AR) foi avaliada pela
análise de regressão linear simples e análise polinomial. A composição granulométrica e a curva de retenção de
água foram significativamente diferentes para os dois substratos. O aumento da densidade diminuiu a PT e o EA
e aumentou a AT e AR. Os maiores valores de AD e AFD foram observados para D1. Foram obtidas equações de
regressão que podem auxiliar na escolha da relação ar/água mais adequada para cada condição.
Palavras-chave: composição granulométrica, densidade, curva de retenção de água, equações de regressão

INTRODUCTION

Horticultural production is mainly based on the
use of substrate instead of the soil. The substrate, a me-
dium in which roots can grow, also serves as physical
support for plants. It can be constituted of pure materi-
als or mixtures. An adequate substrate for plant grow-
ing must present high water retension capacity, fast wa-
ter drainage, and appropriate aeration (Ansorena, 1994).
These characteristics are directly influenced by the

substrate’s particle size distribution and bulk density
(Verdonck &amp;amp; Gabriëls, 1988; Ansorena, 1994; Kämpf,
2000).

The particle size distribution is important to de-
scribe the physical quality of the material and its suitable-
ness for plant growth. It influences the volume of air and
water held by the substrate. The particle size distribution
of the materials used as substrate can vary depending on
their origin and grinding conditions, among other factors
(Ansorena, 1994).

Adequate measurements of bulk density are es-
sential to calculate and understand other important sub-
strate attributes for plant growth, such as total porosity,
aeration space and available water. The substrate bulk
density also influences the water release curve. The de-
termination of the water release curve is important be-
cause it yields data on available water to the plants at cer-
tain tensions (De Boodt &amp;amp; Verdonck, 1972). In addition,
the recommendation on amount of fertilizers for plant
growth always refers to a volume, and demands substrate
bulk density value as a reference (Günther, 1983).

At the moment of filling the container with the
substrate, the relationship mass of the substrate/filled vol-
ume can vary according to the container shape and the
applied force. Consequently, other substrate physical
properties can also be altered. The substrate bulk density
may be affected not only during the process of filling the
container but also during some activities carried out in
the greenhouses. For instance, to transport the container
already filled out, to press the root system during the
transplant, and the irrigation practices (Kämpf et al.,
1999). The irrigation may compact the substrate, reduc-
ing the available water and aeration below critical levels
for optimum plant growth. Substrate with low total po-
rosity and low volume of easily available water demand
great care on the irrigation management to avoid plant
injuries (Fonteno et al., 1981).

Despite the relevance of this subject, little is
known about substrate physical properties changes in-
duced by bulk density changes, and the effects of these
changes during the plant growth period. Therefore, the
objectives of this work were to characterize physical
properties of two horticultural substrates (S1 and S2), to
evaluate the effect of different bulk densities values of
substrates on their air/water relationship, and to develop
mathematical functions to estimate the air/water relation-
ship by increasing substrate bulk density value.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Substrates used in this work are recommended for
vegetables seedlings, and were basically composed by
different amounts of pines peel, peat, expanded vermicu-
lite and ground coal. Two commercial substrate (S1 and
S2) were characterized by determining the particle size
distribution, using 4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mm
sieves; the bulk density (D), following the method de-
scribed by Hoffmann (1970) quoted by Bellé (1990); and
the water release curve (De Boodt &amp;amp; Verdonck, 1972),
all in three replications.

To obtain the bulk density values of 10% (D1),
20% (D2), and 30% (D3) higher than the bulk density (D)
determined in the characterization phase, the mass of each
substrate was increased by 10%, 20% and 30%. The dif-
ferent amounts of substrates were then used to fill the

cores with the same volume. Samples with different bulk
densities (D, D1, D2, and D3) were used to determine the
total porosity (volume water content at saturated condi-
tion), aeration space (volume water content from 0 to -
0.001 Mpa matric potencial), available water (volume
water content from -0.001 to -0.01 Mpa matric potential),
easily available water (volume water content from -0.001
to -0.005 Mpa matric potential), buffering water (volume
water content from -0.005 to -0.01 Mpa matric potential),
and remaining water (volume water content at -0.01 Mpa
matric potential), according to De Boodt &amp;amp; Verdonck
(1972).

Particle size distribution and volume water con-
tent (%) at different matric potentials of the two substrates
were evaluated using analysis of variance for a completely
randomized design with three replications. The means for
particle size and volume water content were tested using
the Tukey test (? = 0.05). Simple linear regression and
polynomial analysis (at 0.05 probability level) were used
to model the effects of the bulk density on the total po-
rosity (TP), aeration space (AS), available water (AW),
easily water available (EAW), buffering water (BW), and
remaining water (RW).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The particle size distribution of the two substrate
was significantly different for all size classes except for
the 1.00-2.00 mm, in which the two substrates had the
same value (20%). The substrate S1 had larger amount of
particles in the 0.25-0.50, 2.00-4.00, and &gt; 4.00 mm
classes. The substrate S2 had larger amount of particles
in the &amp;lt;0.125, 0.125-0.25, and 0.50-1.00 mm classes
(Figure 1).

Substrates with particles well distributed into
many size classes, as observed at the present work, may
have settlement of the particles during the handling and/
or even during the growth period. The smaller particles
may move into the spaces among the larger particles. As
a consequence, the total porosity and the aeration space

of the substrate will be reduced (Spomer, 1979). On the
other hand, the volume of water held by the substrate may
increase as a result of the increment of the number of
small pores (Ansorena, 1994).

The mean values of bulk density were 320.1 g L-1

for the substrate S1, and 309.3 g L
-1 for the substrate S2.

Bulk densities values between 100 and 300 g L-1 are con-
sidered acceptable for seedlings propagation (Kämpf,
2000). Even though substrates used in this work showed
a slight higher bulk density, they could be used in seed-
ling propagation.

The two substrates showed different water release
curves. The substrate S2 had higher volume water con-
tent (%) up to –0.004MPa matric potential, while the sub-
strate S1 showed higher volume water content (%) from
this point to – 0.01MPa (Figure 2), probably because of
differences between the particle size distribution of the
substrates, mainly those associated with the amount of
particles in the 0.25-0.50, and 0.50-1.00 mm classes.
According to Handreck (1983), quoted by Ansorena
(1994), the more important class influencing the aeration
porosity and water retention is the &gt; 0.50 mm class.

The two substrates had TP, AS, EAW, and BW
value close to the range suggested as ideal by De Boodt
&amp;amp; Verdonck (1972), when the bulk density value (D) ob-
tained in the characterization phase (Table 1) was con-
sidered. However, these ideals values are mean values
suggested by the authors, who neither take into account
the plant specie nor the growth techniques. Therefore, dif-
ferent values of those mentioned by De Boodt &amp;amp;
Verdonck (1972) may also be considerad adequate.

In general, increasing the bulk density value, de-
creased TP and AS and increased BW and RW (Table 2).
These results may be associated with the increase of the
substrate mass that may have occupied part of the pore
space that was filled out with air, changing the pore size
distribution. The highest value of AW and EAW was ob-
served in the bulk density values of D1 and D2 for the sub-

strate S1, and in D1 for the substrate S2. Because of the
increase of the substrate mass, the particles occupied the
air space, being the cause of the reduction of the total po-
rosity, and the pore size distribution changed. Probably,
the small particles have occupied the void space among
the large particles, transforming large pores into small
ones, which increased the water hold capacity of the sub-
strates (Spomer, 1979; Ansorena, 1994). The distribution
of the substrates particles in several size classes facili-
tated the adjustment (Figure 1).

In spite of those TP, AS, EAW, and BW values
considered as ideals by De Boodt &amp;amp; Verdonck (1972), the
use of a substrate with specific air/water relationship,
should be done taking into account the plant species,
since plants have different demands of air and water. Or-
dinarily, substrates are recommended for a group of
plants. However, the recommendation should be done tak-
ing into account the best air/water relationship for a spe-
cific specie (Bugbee &amp;amp; Frink, 1986). It is difficult to rec-
ommend the best substrate for groups of plants because
growers use different irrigation techniques, fertilizers,
water quality, and switch growth techniques very often.
Therefore, the recommendation of a substrate must take

into account the grower conditions instead of a group of
species (Verdonck &amp;amp; Gabriëls, 1988).

As a result of differences among the values of
TP, AS, AW, EAW, BW, and RW (Table 2), the math-
ematical function were fitted for each substrate (Figure
3). Then, the functions were used to simulate practical
situations, aiming to help growers to select the best sub-
strate bulk density values for specific growth conditions,
i. e., for a substrate similar to those used in the present
work. The functions were used to obtain the bulk den-
sity values (D) for two AS values (10% and 15%). Af-
terwards, by using the D values, the TP and EAW were
calculated (Table 3).

For 15% of AS value, the S2 showed EAW val-
ues in the ideal range (20-30%), and TP value close to it
(±85%), but showed a bulk density value 4% higher than
the bulk density considerable as ideal (300 g L-1). For
10% of AS value, the S1, also, showed EAW value in the
ideal range, showing the bulk density value 19% higher
than the one considered ideal, and TP value lower than
that considered ideal, i. e. ±85%. The value of the sub-
strate bulk density is not always the limiting condition
for a good plant growth.

If the crop does not require a high aeration space,
it is possible to increase the substrate bulk density value
to get a higher easily available water to the plants. The
mathematical models for the substrates S1 and S2 can be
used to simulate best air/water relationship to a specific
specie before filling the containers. The models can help
growers to choose appropriate bulk density of the sub-
strate taking into account the plant species and growth
techniques.
