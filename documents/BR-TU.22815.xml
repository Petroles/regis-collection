he purpose of this study was to analyze the bone repair around commercially pure titanium implants with rough and porous surface,
fabricated using powder metallurgy technique, after their insertion in tibiae of rabbits. Seven male rabbits were used. Each animal received 3
porous-surface implants in the left tibia and 3 rough-surface implants in the right tibia. The rabbits were sacrificed 4 weeks after surgery and
fragments of the tibiae containing the implants were submitted to histological and histomorphometric analyses to evaluate new bone
formation at the implant-bone interface. Means (%) of bone neoformation obtained in the histomorphometric analysis were compared by
Student’s t-test for paired samples at 5% significance level.. The results of the histological analysis showed that osseointegration occurred
for both types of implants with similar quality of bone tissue. The histomorphometric analysis revealed means of new bone formation at
implant-bone interface of 79.69 ± 1.00% and 65.05 ± 1.23% for the porous- and rough-surface implants, respectively. Statistically
significant difference was observed between the two types of implants with respect to the amount new bone formation (p&lt;0.05). In
conclusion, the porous-surface implants contributed to the osseointegration because they provide a larger contact area at implant-bone
interface.

contendo os implantes foram submetidos à análise histológica e histomorfométrica, visando analisar a neoformação óssea na interface osso-
implante. As médias (%) obtidas na análise histomorfométrica foram avaliadas por meio do teste estatístico t-student de amostras pareadas
com nível de significância de 5%. Os resultados da análise histológica mostraram que a osseointegração foi obtida nos dois tipos de implantes
com similar qualidade de tecido ósseo. Na análise histomorfométrica, verificaram-se médias de neoformação óssea na interface osso-implante
de 79,69% ± 1,00 e 65,05 ± 1,23 para os implantes de superfície porosa e rugosa, respectivamente, e foi observada diferença estatisticamente
significante entre os dois tipos de implantes com relação à quantidade de neoformação óssea. Concluiu-se que os implantes de superfície
porosa contribuíram para a osseointegração devido à sua maior superfície de contato na interface osso-implante.

INTRODUCTION

Pure titanium and titanium alloys are the most used
biomaterials for fabrication of surgical implants due to their
excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility15 and
resistance to corrosion16. They are considered ideal materials
because they have shown better acceptability by human
tissues than other metals under diverse circumstances16.

The high biocompatibility of titanium derives partially
from the stable and protective oxide layer, which apparently
aids in connecting extracellular matrix to the implant surface16.
The knowledge of the biomaterial-bone tissue interface is
extremely important to define which material would promote
a better tissue response and which kind of surface would be
more adequate for the proliferation of bone cells21. After
placement of an implant in the surgical cavity, several cellular
events take place. Ideally, these events should lead to wound
healing by intimate apposition of the bone to the biomaterial,
i.e., osseointegration6. Osseointegration is a direct structural
and functional connection between living bone and the
surface of an implant5.

Surgical implants can be either cylindrical, conical or
screw-shaped12,25. Regardless of their external shape,
microscopically they can present smooth, porous or textured
surfaces1,4,5,10,19,26. Several studies have shown that the
success or failure of surgical implants can be related to
chemical3,12,19 and biological12 properties of their surfaces
as well as to their micromorphology13,16,26. The differences
in the microstructure of implant surfaces seem to influence
stress distribution, bone retention, cellular response on its
surface and consequently the osseointegration3,12,23.

The porous surface has been considered as a good
alternative to rough coating11. Biomaterials with porous
structure are aimed at optimizing the interfacial resistance
between the material and the bone, leading to a more effective
fixation of the implant. Porous implants allow an
interdigitation of the bone tissue to the implant, thus
increasing the interfacial resistance18. Additionally, a porous
surface provides a more efficient fixation, shorter initial
healing time19 and increased cellular adhesion potential.
Otherwise, screw implants with rough surface present only
juxtaposition of bone11,12,21. Porous implants have been
developed to be stabilized by bone ingrowth into the
pores11,19. Pilliar, et al.19 (1998) reviewed and compared several
designs and surfaces of surgical implants and concluded
that the surface with pores of 100 µm in diameter would be
ideal for the neoformation of a three-dimensional
osseointegration net inside the implant. Oliveira, et al.18
(2002) determined that, although the fabrication process
parameters have been optimized, the ideal porous
requirements for surgical implants have not yet been
reached. These authors reported that some changes are
necessary in order to increase porosity and advocated that
an analysis of pore size distribution along the sample has
been performed to indicate more efficiently which porous
fraction would better meet implant requirements17.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze, by
histological and histomorphometric methods, the bone

repair around cylindrical grade-2 commercially pure titanium
implants with rough and porous surface, fabricated using
powder metallurgy technique, after their insertion in tibiae
of rabbits.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Seven male New Zealand albino rabbits aged 6 to 8 months
and weighing 3.5 kg on average were used in this study. The
animals were provided by the Vivarium of São Jose dos Campos
Dental School and were kept in individual cages and fed a
commercial pet chow (Coelhil R; Socil, Belo Horizonte, MG,
Brazil) and water ad libitum.

The commercially pure titanium implants with either rough
or porous surface were fabricated at the Department of
Materials of the Air and Space Institute at CTA (Brazilian Air
and Space Technical Center, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil)
in an association with the National Institute of Technology
of Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). The implants had
3.0 mm in diameter and pore diameters ranging from 250 and
350 µm.

The implants were cleaned, wrapped and sterilized in
autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. Prior to surgery, the animals
were weighed and injected intramuscularly with 13 mg/kg of
aqueous solution of 2% hydrochloride of 2-(2,6-xylidine)-5,6-
dihydro-4H-1,3-thiazin (Rompum; Bayer, São Paulo, SP, Brazil),
which is an analgesic, sedative and muscular relaxant
substance. General anesthesia was obtained with
administration of 33 mg/Kg of ketamine (Dopalen; Agribrands
do Brasil Ltda, Paulinia, SP, Brazil).). A local anesthetic
composed of 3% octapressin combined with prilocaine
hydrochloride and felypressin (3%Citanest R – Dentsply) was
also used.

The implant was removed from the wrap, placed in the
perforation and pressed into the surgical cavity until it was
fixed to the cortical bone. In order to standardize the procedure,
the right tibia received a rough surface implant (control) group,
while the left tibia received a porous-surface implant. The
muscular tissue was sutured with absorbable thread and the
skin with mononylon 4-0 surgical thread. After that, all animals
were given penicillin and were monitored until sacrifice 30
days after surgery.

After euthanasia, the surgical segments with the implants
were removed and the implants were tested for mobility using
a clinical clamp. The segments were placed in 10% formalin
solution for at least 48 h.

Next, the specimens were dehydrated in an increasing
ethanol series (50%, 75%, 90% and 100%), embedded in
polyester resin (Orto cristal T 208; Valglass com. e ind. Ltda.
São Paulo, SP, Brazil) and sectioned longitudinally in a
sectioning machine for hard tissues (Labcut 1010; Extec
Technologies, Inc., Enfield, CT, USA) providing 80-µm-thick
serial sections on average. The sections were ground in a
polishing machine (Labpol 8-12; Extec Technologies, Inc.)
using sandpapers of decreasing abrasiveness (#400, #600
and #1200) until reaching a thickness of 30-40 µm. The cuts
were analyzed under optical microscopy and scanning electron

microscopy (SEM). Images were taken with a digital camera
(DSC-S85, Cyber-shot, Sony) coupled to the optical
microscope and evaluated on a television monitor (Panasonic).

Three sections of each implant were evaluated for the
percentage of bone neoformation at implant-bone interface.
Two areas of each section were digitized (X100), representing
the medial and distal interfaces of the implant. Therefore, 124
sections were analyzed for each type of implant. Bone
neoformation rate and bone ingrowth into the pores were
calculated using the Image J software (NIH, USA). The final
data were submitted to statistical analysis using the Minitab
software version 12.3 (Minitab Inc, USA) and Student’s t-
test at 5% significance level.

RESULTS

All animals presented satisfactory postoperative results,
without any evidence of inflammation or infection of the
surgical site. No adverse reaction was observed during the
procedure. During the clinical evaluation, performed with a
clinical clamp, none of the implants presented mobility.

In both groups (rough- and porous-surface implants),
there was bone neoformation around the implant leading to
osseointegration (Figures 1 and 2). This new bone formation
was similar in both groups and was constituted by mature
bone trabeculae that presented lamellar arrangement and by
medullar spaces of different sizes. In several specimens,
regardless of the analyzed group, bone neoformation above
the implants and at their bottom surface was observed,
sometimes contacting the internal cortical face on the opposite
side. A clear delimitation between the new bone formation
and the preexistent cortical bone was also noticed (Figures 3,
4 and 5).

The results showed that the types of implant used
presented statistically significant difference to each other
regarding the amount of new bone formation on the implant-
bone interface, the porous-surface implants showing a larger
amount neoformed bone. Table 1 shows the means of bone
neoformation (%) at bone-implant interface of rough- vs.
porous-surface implants.

DISCUSSION

In our study, cylindrical implants with porous surface
were compared to cylindrical implants with rough surface
regarding the quantity and quality of new bone formation
on the implant-bone interface after implantation in rabbit
tibiae. The results showed no difference of new bone quality
between both types of implants. However, when the quantity
of bone neoformation at implant-bone interface was
evaluated, a larger formation of bone tissue was observed
for the porous-surface implants, and this difference was
statistically significant.

The most important factors to dental implant
osseointegration are related to the characteristics of its
surfaces, which include topography and chemical and
electric properties of the material19, since bone-implant
interaction is mainly related to the most external layers of
the implants13. Important factors to a more successful
osseointegration are: implant material, implant shape,
surgical technique20, quantity of bone tissue20,25, load6 and
implant resistance4. However, some other factors such as
surface energy, sterilization techniques and chemical and
topographic properties of the implant surface are extremely
important for the final outcome of osseointegration2,8,12,16.

In the present study, the results showed that all implants
were well tolerated when placed in rabbit tibiae, thus
corroborating the findings of previous studies that indicated
titanium as the best biomaterial for surgical implants15,16.

Bone growth is also dependent on factors such as
percentage of surface porosity, stability and degree of
micromovement of the implant and the presence of gaps
between the implant and the bone at the time of placement.
Implants placed under pressure inside the surgical cavity
help minimizing the gaps and implant micromovement8.
Therefore, in order to obtain osseointegration, the surgical
cavity must be prepared with the least injury possible15,20.
In order to cause minimal damage to the surrounding bone
tissues, in the present study, bone perforation was performed
using burs of increasingly larger diameters,, and under
constant saline irrigation. After that, the implants were gently

pressed into the surgical cavity, which diminished the gap
between the implant and the bone and promoted efficient
stability. Additionally, all implants were evaluated with a
clinical clamp at the moment of sacrifice, 30 days after surgery,
and were stable.

Some previous studies used a 4-week healing period to
evaluate the biocompatibility of metal materials7,14,17,22.
Deporter, et al.10 (1986) reported that healing periods (i.e.,
between implant placement and euthanasia of the animals)
longer than 4 weeks added no benefits to increase the
quantity of bone tissue ingrowth into porous-surface
implants, and observed that only bone tissue maturation
took place after this period. Thus, in the present study, a 4-
week period was used to evaluate the biocompatibility of
porous-surface grade 2 commercially pure titanium implants
fabricated by means of powder metallurgy technique.

The purpose of studying and developing porous-surface
implants is to promote a more stable and biocompatible
fixation of titanium implants. The creation of a porous
geometry surface aims not only at increasing contact area
but also at allowing bone ingrowth into the pores, including
those located more centrally. Such ingrowth is due to pore
intercommunication, which produces a three-dimensional
net and allows a mechanical entanglement 7,8,9,18.

The porous-surface implant have an ideal diameter for
the proliferation of bone cells2,12, and most studies report
that pore diameter ranges from 100 to 400 µm. In addition,
the pores have been shown to be interconnected, so that
bone interdigitation into the porous structure may occur,
thus reaching maximum interfacial resistance18,24. However,
Nguyen, et al.17 (2004) reported that small pores measuring
only 45 µm in diameter also allow bone ingrowth. Furthermore
Frosch, et al.14 (2002) found that 300 to 600 µm pores showed
a three-dimensional, reticular osteoblast-like cell
development within 4 weeks, and that in 1000 µm pores cell
ingrowth was incomplete. In the present study, the diameter
of the pores varied between 250 and 350 µm, corroborating
the findings of other studies9,19,23.

Svehla, et al.23 (2000) compared five different implant
surfaces and verified that porous surfaces promoted an
excellent substrate for the ingrowth of bone tissue and

consequent implant fixation, whereas smooth surfaces
resulted in the formation of a fibrous tissue and improper
fixation. In the present study, when the cylindrical porous-
surface implants were compared to the cylindrical rough-
surfaces implants, osseointegration was observed in both
groups. No formation of fibrous tissue was observed at
bone-implant interface. However, significantly more bone
formation was observed in the porous-surface implants.

Deporter, et al.11 (1990) concluded that a smaller segment
of porous-surface implants allowed a more effective contact
with the bone, due to a bigger contact area, determined by
its topography. Similar findings were observed in the present
study in which a statistically significant difference was
observed between the groups in relation to the quantity of
bone neoformation at titanium-bone interface. Therefore,
smaller porous-surface implants could be developed to be
used in complex clinical situations such as regions with
low-quality bone9,19.

The results of this study showed that because of the
larger contact surface promoted by the presence of pores,
there was more bone ingrowth on the implant-bone interface.
Such results are consistent with those of Cook and Rust-
Dawicki7 (1995), Deporter, et al.9 (2002), Deporter, et al.10 (1986),
Deporter, et al.11 (1990), Frosch, et al.14 (2002), Karabuda, et
al.15 (1999), Story, et al.22 (1998), Svehla, et al.23 (2000), Vidigal
Junior, et al.25 (1999), Zinger, et al.26 (2005) who also observed
more effectiveness of the porous-surface implants compared
to other types of implants.

CONCLUSION

Based on the results of this study, it may be concluded
that the cylindrical porous-surface implants yielded greater
bone neoformation than the cylindrical rough-surface
implants because of their larger area in contact with the
bone tissue and the presence of an intercommunicating
porous structure that allowed the formation of a three-
dimensional osseointegration network.
