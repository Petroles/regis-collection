Abstract
The quantification of flow components is important for water resource management. The base, interflow, and runoff flows 
of nested basins of the Paracatu River (SF-7) were estimated with recursive signal filters in this study. At first, stationary 
analysis and multivariate gap filling were applied to the flow data. A methodology is presented, proposing filter calibration 
with the runoff influence and inflection of the recession curve for dry season. Filters are improved with a logic constraint 
that limits water flow overestimation within algorithm iteration. The results were coherent with previous studies and with 
hydrogeological and climatological maps.

Resumo
A quantificação dos componentes de vazão é importante para a gestão de recursos hídricos. Empregaram-se, neste estudo, 
filtros recursivos de sinais para delimitação dos fluxos de base, interfluxo e rápido de sub-bacias aninhadas na Bacia do Rio 
Paracatu (SF-7). Preliminarmente, os dados de vazão tiveram sua consistência avaliada por meio de análises de estaciona-
lidade e preenchimento multivariado das lacunas de dados. Apresenta-se uma metodologia em que os filtros são calibrados 
pela influência do escoamento superficial e pela inflexão na curva de recessão do período sazonal de seca. Os filtros foram 
aprimorados por uma restrição lógica, que limita a sobre-estimação da vazão à cada iteração do algoritmo. Os resultados 
foram condizentes com estudos prévios e com mapeamentos hidrogeológicos e climatológicos.

INTRODUCTION

Hydrograph separation between superficial runoff components 
and the base flow is important for water resource management, 
especially when referring to dry and flood conditions (Tularam 
and Ilahee, 2008); reservoir navigation and maintenance 
(McMahon and Mein, 1986); ecological flow, salinity and al-
gae management (Santhi et al., 2008); and nutrient and con-
taminant outflows into water body (Reay et al., 1992; Dolezal 
and Kvítek, 2004; Schilling and Zhang, 2004). The compo-
nents of hydrograph separation can also serve as input data 
for more complex models, such as those for water budget 
and hydrological forecasting (Corzo and Solomatine, 2007). 
By analyzing the groundwater contribution to each sub-basin 
flow of water courses, it is possible to adequately define how 
each area effectively contributes for recharging and discharg-
ing of the aquifers.

Specific mapping of the groundwater discharge by sepa-
ration of its hydrograph components, in nested basins, can 
be a useful diagnostic tool for articulating issues involv-
ing environmental policies and water resources, with the 
objective of developing a sustainable management frame-
work. This applies to the geo-environmental management 
context in which government intends to gradually imple-
ment management policies, such as water tax and payment 
for environmental services. Mapping makes it possible to 
recognize the relative importance of each basin sub-region 
regarding the underground water supplied to the rivers. 
With this information, water and soil conservation man-
agements can be valued, mainly in the most critical areas. 
Thus, one of the adapted policies could be that whoever best  
contributes to the recharge maintenance of the aquifer would 
pay less for water usage, or maybe, as a counterpart,  
would be paid for the environmental service provided. Since 
most water resource conflicts occur during dry seasons, 
when river flow is sustained mainly by groundwater dis-
charge, the base flow (and its respective mapping) quantifies 
the most critical characteristics to be considered. In addi-
tion, quick flow mapping could indicate areas that are inter-
esting for the implementation of flow retention and regular-
ization techniques, which involve water containment during 
the rainy season and its liberation during the dry season. 

As proposed by Johnson et al. (1999), Dillon (2005) 
and Martins Junior (2006), the final objective of a poli-
cy that integrates orderly sustainable land and water use 
would be to hydrogeologically and economically quantify 
the feasibility of increasing infiltration in areas of great-
er recharge potential during the rainy season, in order to 
guarantee an adequate minimum flow during the dry sea-
son and improve water quality.With future demanding 
more refined environmental management, the standards 
established by distinct entities (federal, state and munici-
pal, together with those directly involved with watersheds) 

could provide the needed degrees of protection or conser-
vation, which would be gradually defined as hydrogeolog-
ical knowledge increases. Therefore, at a given site, sci-
entifically reliable intervention could be practiced for the 
sustainable usage of its natural resources.

Gap filling in hydrological data series

The stationary evaluation of hydrological data in time se-
ries is justified by the fact that it is assumed to be necessary 
for hydrological and hydrogeological statistical modeling 
(Tucci, 2009; Souza et al., 2009), including its use to estimate 
input data for gaps in the flow data series. Noteworthy is the 
methodological attitude proposed by Müller et al. (1998), 
who claims that stationary study of hydrological time series 
should be employed as a tool to aggregate information and 
for comparative analyses, which would be more than simply 
hypothesis rejection testing.

As a preparatory step for filling in the flow gaps from 
the stream gauges, the Brazilian National Water Agency 
(Souza et al., 2009) recommends the grouping support ap-
proach of gauging stations. This methodology consists of 
selecting data from stations that are topologically closer 
downstream and upstream of the gauging station from 
which the gaps are being filled. It is also feasible to include 
data from stations in nearby basins, providing these basins 
have homogeneously physiographic characteristics. The 
stations whose data present the greatest correlating coef-
ficients are used for filling in the gaps. Rodriguez (2004), 
Novaes (2005), Moreira (2006), Latuf (2007) and 
Souza (2009) used the gauging station support approach 
for hydrological studies at the Paracatu River Basin.

Schafer and Graham (2002), Allison (2002) and 
Enders (2010) classified expectation maximization (EM) 
(Hartley, 1958; Dempster, Laird, Rubin, 1977) and mul-
tiple imputation (MI) as the most robust methods available 
for gap analysis in statistical databases. The algorithms from 
both methods are present in the Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences (SPSS) software model — missing values. 
Presti et al. (2010) indicate that using multivariate techniques 
(such as EM and MI) increase the statistical reliability of hy-
drological data gap filling. Thus, it is possible to work with 
greater gap percentages or shorter time series. Furthermore, 
since accurate flow estimates of the hydrogeological basin re-
quire daily runoff data, extra statistical care must be provid-
ed to ensure that data validation is more reliable, rather than 
when working with only a series of monthly measurements.

A typical case of discharge estimation improvement 
using multivariate techniques for gap filling occurs when 
one stream gauge receives water input from two or more 
supporting affluent gaging stations, with significantly dif-
ferent discharge behavior. Analogically, another case, but 
in a more complex scenario, refers to the spatiotemporal

heterogeneity of rainfall occurrence registered in nearby 
gauging stations and in the station requiring gap fillings.

Amisigo and Vand de Giesen (2005), in applied studies, 
demonstrated that the EM technique provides more precise 
estimations of flow data gaps, when compared to the classi-
cal regression ones. Enders (2010) mathematically showed 
how EM estimation is more robust in relation to data dis-
tribution presuppositions, when compared to conventional 
regression techniques. In addition, EM input presents an 
advantage over multivariate regression by maximizing its 
statistical power through information obtained from the dis-
tribution curve of incomplete cases, and by estimating the 
original time series variance level (Enders, 2010).

Meanwhile, MI adds a random residual to the selected 
multiple regressions (analogically to a stochastic multiple 
regression), so that the results maintain the original vari-
ance of the observations as a whole. However, even though 
this random residual keeps the original variance, it distances 
the input value “at the same measurement” in relation to its 
maximum probability value, thus reducing data estimation 
reliability. Cano and Andreu (2010) alerted that in series 
with significant time correlation such as that with hydro-
logical data, the sum of random residual by the conventional 
MI algorithms could lead to results that are less compatible 
with the natural behavior of real data.

Also, Enders (2010) stated that the methodology op-
tions of MI algorithms are not as mature, consolidated, and 
tested as those of EM. On the other hand, an existing broad 
study by Amisigo and Vand de Giesen (2005) about EM, 
applied to gap filling in hydrologic data, brought more se-
curity for using such methodology.

Presti et al. (2010) suggested that in unimodal oscillating 
climates (contrast between dry and rainy seasons, as in the case 
of the Paracatu River Basin), the gap filling should be applied 
separately for two periods of the year: rainy and drought. Thus, 
the distinct water flow dynamics at each of these two seasons 
will be captured with more assurance in their correlation. In the 
dry season, it is expected that the coefficient of the recession 
curve in logarithmic scale, in each basin, will be one of the de-
fining characteristics of the correlation for lag filling. The rainy 
period, in turn, would present a major influence from the flux 
characteristics referring to the separation between superficial, 
subsurface, and groundwater flows.

Base flow estimation

Field and direct inference methods are amongst the most 
widely used for base flow inference. The field methods 
include direct monitoring of the aquifer level (by wells  
and/or piezometers), correlations parting from water  
temperature obtained by direct measurement or tracers, 
and infiltration monitoring by lysimeters. However, the 
employment of these techniques for large basins involves 

exorbitant costs due to the extensive sampling network  
required and creates uncertainty because of the spatial  
heterogeneity of hydrogeological processes. 

Regarding techniques that try to specify the base flow 
by indirect inference, the most common are: water budget, 
hydrograph component separation, calculation of the flow 
recession (equation from Rorabaugh, 1964), and system-
atic comparison between rainfall events for hydrological 
pulses analysis (Su, 1995).

Nevertheless, because the hydrograph separation 
methods focus only on the base flow of watercourses, they 
do not incorporate the quantitative loss concerning river 
evapotranspiration and deep percolation that crosses be-
neath the gauging station (Risser et al., 2005). These two 
factors are important for the recharge analysis of the aqui-
fers since they interfere in the water budget of the basin.

Base flow separation by means of computational calcu-
lations eliminates the imprecision and inherent subjectiv-
ity of the traditional graphic methods as those proposed by 
Barnes (1939). However, Risser et al. (2005) noticed that 
conventional hydrograph separation by numerical meth-
ods (PART, local minimums fixed intervals, fluctuating in-
tervals) might create difficulties for comparing base flow 
estimates of different-sized basins (including the nested 
ones). An increase in basin area implies: greater runoff 
time, flood lessening, bed friction on the flow, partially 
simultaneous flow contributions from tributaries, and re-
gional hydrogoeological flow, among other factors, which 
can rarely be automatically calibrated by the available al-
gorithms. Figure 1 highlights how these methods can gen-
erate distortions in base flow separation.

interval change is arbitrary and does not adequately identify 
inflection points on the curve in any of the hydrographs.

The numerical methods for recharge calculations through 
recession curve analysis, theoretically, are not affected by this 
limitation. As such, instead of starting with the recognition of 
the inflection point (like hydrograph separation methods), the 
methods for analyzing recession begin by identifying flow 
peaks, after which the flow recession behavior is calculated 
(Rutledge, 1993, 1998, 2000). In order to analyze flow reces-
sion, it is necessary to calibrate the critical time (tc), that is, the 
period to cease the influence of runoff. To achieve such thing, 
Rutledge (1993) and Welderufael and Woyessa (2010) refer to 
the empirical formula made by Lynsley et al. (1975):

N = 0.827* A0.2 (1)

where:
N: time (in days) after hydrographic peaking to stop the 
participation of runoff; and
A: is the area of the basin, in km2.

Notwithstanding, this formula presumes that the rain-
fall event covered the entire basin — a criterion that makes 
the equation less reliable with the basin area increase.

For greater reliability of the recession curve analysis, it 
is necessary to identify relatively long and continuous re-
cession periods (without intercurrent flow peaks) (Halford 
and Mayer, 2000). Care must be taken so that abnormally 
low flow periods are not presented as part of the standard 
behavior of the water system (Rutledge, 2003). Halford 
and Mayer (2000) and Larocque et al. (2010) observed that 
the manual and automatic hydrograph separation methods, 
when applied based on analysis of recession at closely 
spaced peaks related to intercurrent rain, could lose their 
reference criteria and as such diminish the reliability of the 
component separation process. Furthermore, it would tend 
to overestimate the base flow value by considering a reces-
sion flux, which is still under the effects of superficial and 
subsurface runoff from recent rainfall events (Figure 2).

Estimation of flow components by recursive filters

- 7 -Geol. USP, Sér. cient., São Paulo, v. 13, n. 1, p. 3-24, Março 2013

In order to incorporate the advantages of recession anal-
ysis into criteria for hydrograph separation without distort-
ing them by the use of temporal interval variables, an alter-
native would be to use digital recursive filters. With their 
use, it is presumed that the low-frequency waves of the 
hydrograph inform the base flow, while the high ones re-
late to the runoff (Lim et al., 2005). The sum of both waves 
corresponds to the total flow of the hydrograph.

Peters and Van Lanen (2005) and Brodie and Hostetler 
(2005) state that the inherent disadvantage of the recursive 
filters is that they rely only on the hydrograph form, with-
out a sustainable base of physical parameters. To over-
come this problem, Ghanbarpour, Teimouri and Gholami 
(2008), Asmeron (2008), Tularam and Ilahee (2008) and 
Lim et al. (2007, 2010) proposed the possibility of cali-
brating the recursive filter parameters, based on the reces-
sion curve analysis of the hydrograph.

OBJECTIVES

This article had as a general objective to present a study 
about flow components of the sub-basins of Paracatu 
River, furnishing data to improve the management of its 
water resources. To achieve this, the following specific 
tasks were undertaken:
• stationary analysis of the flow average and variance for 

the gauging stations in Paracatu River Basin;
• discharge gap filling with the use of the multivariate 

techniques  EM and MI;
• filter calibrating with double parameters, i.e., runoff in-

fluence and recession curve inflection;
• incorporation of a logical restrictor to estimate the base 

flow of recursive filters, impeding an overestimation of 

the base flow participation in the total discharge calcu-
lated by each iteration of the algorithm;

• spatial analysis of the relationship between base flow 
estimation and its geographical data regarding climate 
and hydrology.

It is worthnoting that preexisting studies using recur-
sive filters have yet to focalize on the comparison of basins 
with diverse sizes. This article, by encompassing the con-
catenation between Paracatu Basin and its nested basins 
through readings from internal gauging stations, presents 
unique scientific data.

METHODOLOGY

Paracatu River Basin characterization

The Paracatu River Basin is almost totally located in 
Northwestern Minas Gerais, in Brazil with a small up-
stream area in the State of Goiás and Federal District 
(Figure 3). The basin has an extension of 45,154 km2, and 
it is the largest among all the affluents that flow directly 
into the São Francisco River.

The Paracatu River Basin has a megathermic rainy 
climate of the Aw type (IGAM, 2006). It is a typically 
rainy tropical with high temperatures and oscillating un-
imodal precipitation concentrated in the months from 
October to April, when it rains an average of 93% of the 
total annual rainfall (Mulholland, 2009). Figure 4 shows 
the rainfall distribution. From the basin’s climatic charac-
terization by Ruralminas (1996), it becomes evident that 
there is a spatial correlation between the precipitation 
data and other climatic variables, such as temperature,

solar radiation, humidity, evapotranspiration, cloudiness, 
water stress, and storm frequency.

The Paracatu River Basis stratigraphy presents dis-
tinct rock systems that support aquifers (Figure 5). 
By means of the graphic method proposed by Barnes 
(1939), the Minas Gerais Technological Center 
Foundation (CETEC, 1981) estimated that, for the 
Paracatu River Basin, at different points, from 32 to 
48% of the watercourse flow is maintained by under-
ground aquifers. This contribution increases as the wa-
tercourse passes through recharge areas of cretaceous 
sandstones and tertiary-quaternary sedimentary cover, 
and therefore they were characterized as favorable re-
charge areas. In addition, these calculations considered 
that the infiltration and contribution from the fractured 
and Karst formations of Bambuí aquifer would be very 
low or virtually nonexistent when compared with the 
aforementioned granular aquifers. Ramos and Paixão 
(2004) also highlighted the importance of porous sedi-
mentary aquifers for the perpetuation of rivers feeding 
São Francisco River Basin.

Areado and Urucuia Formations (Cretaceous) are 
characterized by free aquifers that furnish a significant 
amount of water through hillside sources (CETEC, 1981) 
and possibly through direct effluence along streams. They 
are formed by thick sandstone (up to 140 m) and lie di-
rectly on an impermeable substrate of the Bambuí group 
(Eo-Cambrian) (CETEC, 1981). However, the underly-
ing mesofractures identified in the Bambuí Formation 
may increase the complexity of these aquifers through the 
combination of fractured and granular aquifers (Martins 
Junior, 2006). Mata da Corda Formation, with up to 100 m 

thickness, also has a porous aquifer overlying the Aerado 
Formation (RURALMINAS, 1996).

Morphologically, porous aquifers of the older tertiary-
quaternary cover lie underneath part of the São Francisco 
Residual Plateaus, forming tabular surfaces with a height 
of more than 900 m (Andrade, 2007). In the Paracatu 
River Basin, the tabular surfaces are scarcely reworked 
and have almost no drainage. These characteristics are due 
to a thick sedimentary layer with high infiltration poten-
tial (CETEC, 1981). The main discharge areas are located 
at the foothills of the elevations, along the flank or edges 
of the plateaus, where there is contact between the aquifer 
and an impermeable substrate. These aquifers have an av-
erage thickness of 10 m and can exceptionally attain 30 m 
(RURALMINAS, 1996), with a registered record of up to 
80 m (Mourão, 2001).

The more recent tertiary-quaternary sedimented aquifers 
are located in the river plains of Rio Paracatu River Basin, 
lying atop the Bambuí Group pelites with low permeability, 
whereupon there is frequent exudation in the contact area 
of two lithologies (CETEC, 1981; Mourão, 2001). Due to 
predominant geomorphology of the plane surfaces of this 
aquifer system (Andrade, 2007), CETEC (1981) hypoth-
esize that local and regional base flows exist where there 
are hydraulic connections between aquifers and rivers — in 
this way, the aquifers function as flow regulators of such

watercourses. The water storage potential is less than in the 
other porous aquifers of the basin, due to the narrowness — 
an average of 5 m (RURALMINAS, 1996).

Fractured aquifers occur in the Bambuí and Canastra 
Groups, as well as in the Paracatu, Vazante, and Paranoá 
Formations. Their storage capacity depends on their frac-
ture extension, continuity and interconnections, together 
with their opening and interior void volume. In compar-
ison with granular aquifers, the possibility of direct rain 
infiltration in these fractured rock reservoirs is small be-
cause the fractures are narrow (Mourão, 2001). The re-
charge happens by vertical infiltration from an upper shal-
low aquifer or by deeper infiltration from the cretaceous 
and tertiary-quaternary sedimentary layer covers, as well 
as by points where both fracture and drainage coincides, 
that is, through watercourses controlled by fracture direc-
tion (RURALMINAS, 1996).

The Karstic aquifers of the Paracatu Basin predomi-
nantly correspond to geomorphological areas consisting of 
ridges and steep slopes (Andrade, 2007). Since they are 
distributed along the deformation zone of the Unaí Ridge 
and were submitted to strong tectonism (transcurrent and 
thrust faulting, as well as folding structures), it is assumed 
that there is a high degree of fracturing. Furthermore, the 
presence of sinkholes, caves and sinks indicates endokarst 
development by dissolution. It can also be presumed that 
these aquifers enable a significant hydrogeological flow. 
In evolved Karstic forms, the expressive flow from their 
inherent ducts produces aquifers with accentuated reces-
sion coefficients because as the water leaves them quickly, 
they provide little water for the springs during the apex of 
the dry season.

The quaternary alluvial deposits are usually found 
along the drainage system, in flood plains and in terraces. 
They are active zones for water exchange, for receiving 
recharge from the rivers during rainy periods, and for dis-
charging it during dry periods (Mourão, 2001).

In the transition areas between the residual plateaus and 
the São Francisco depression in Paracatu Basin, the domi-
nant reworked geomorphological features of the hills and 
slopes are regions where the hydrological role of transient 
flow occurs. This is because their localization is between the 
aquifer systems and due to the fact that the greater inclina-
tion disfavors rain infiltration in these areas. Nevertheless, 
it is good to remember that all surfaces with a weathered 
cover contribute in part to groundwater recharging.

Component flow estimation of the basins with 
gauging stations

Data source for the analyses performed for this article is 
the record of gauging stations flow available on the Internet 
for all regions in Brazil, supplied by the hydrological 

Information system (Hidroweb) of the Brazilian National 
Water Agency (ANA, 2008).

Rodriguez (2004), Novaes (2005), Moreira (2006) and 
Souza (2009) opted for the period between 1970 and 2000 
(30 years), and selected and evaluated the use of 19 to 21 
gauging stations at the Paracatu River Basin as consistent. 
However, the analysis of the operation history of these 
stations shows that a greater part of them became opera-
tive between 1975 and 1976. Consequently, by choosing 
a main set of stations from 1976 to 2000, it was possi-
ble to mount a basic block of 23 stations, minimizing the 
gap filling and series extension uncertainties. July of 2001 
was the period’s limit due to the beginning of interventions 
for the construction of the Queimado Hydroelectric Power 
Plant, at the sub-basin of Preto River after which the hy-
drological behavior of the area would influence data.

Two gauging stations were also selected with periods in-
ferior to that of the main block: 426450000 (1974 – 1984) 
and 42350000 (1973 – 1981). These stations received differ-
ential treatment that will be further elaborated in this article. 

The location of the gauging stations used in this article 
with their respective nested basins is shown in Figure 6. 
The basin drainage delimitations related to gauging sta-
tions were elaborated on the basis of a hydrologically 
consistent digital elevation model. It was based on the 
topographic treatment of Shuttle Radar Topography 
Mission (SRTM) — data and on the IBGE hydrogra-
phy (1:100.000), reconditioned with the Hydrotools for 
ArcGis 10 extension and with pre-processing algorithms 
of the Saga 2.0.8 program in order to obtain altimetric 
consistency regarding the runoff from the slopes, the len-
tic water bodies, and the drainage network.

Stationary analysis was performed by means of 
tests combined with Fisher’s equality of variance and 
Student’s equality of averages, as recommended by Tucci 
(2002) and by the Brazilian National Water Agency 
(Souza et al., 2009). About the gauging station data, tests 
for average, minimum and maximum stationarity at 1 and 
5% level of significance were performed to analyze the 
average and monthly variations, with successive tests of 
minimum five-year groupings in continuous combinations 
for all the possibilities of grouping in series, for the hydro-
logical period from 1976 to 2000. Analogously, station-
arity tests were also performed for the period of 1957 to 
2000 at the oldest four gauging stations of the Basin. The 
tests were carried out on SisCAH 1.0 program, which is 
available without any costs at the Brazilian National Water 
Agency website.

For the gap filling methodology, a combination of 
methods was used: support station selection; rainy and dry 
season data separation; and value estimation using the EM 
and MI algorithms in order to compare the consistency of 
the results for each method.

The preliminary grouping of support stations consid-
ered: areas of homogeneous water systems proposed by 
Euclydes (2004); drainage pattern areas by Martins Junior 
(2009); spatial variations of the cartographic bases (geol-
ogy, geomorphology, soil, slope, and height) by Martins 
Junior (2006); topological connection of the drainage net-
work; stationarity tests; and correlation coefficient among 
the discharges time series. Also taken into account 
were the areas with a homogeneous annual rainfall rate, 
which would also be spatially correlated with the other cli-
matic parameters of the basin.

Filling in the gaps with EM and IM involved using data 
from before 1976,  when available, to amplify the com-
parison possibility for the statistical distribution of the dai-
ly discharge at the referenced gauging station with those 
of the selected support gauging stations. For the gauging 
stations that were not affected by the construction of the 
Queimada Hydroelectric Plant, discharge data from 2001 
on were also used.

From the point of view of existing conflicts con-
cerning water usage in the Paracatu Basin for irrigation 
(Pruski et al., 2007), it can be questioned if this water

consumption does not influence the consistency of the 
discharge analysis for the gauging stations. However, re-
search performed by Rodriguez (2008) demonstrated that 
this water consumption for irrigation presented less than 
10% effect on the minimum (Q7,10) and permanent (Q95) 
discharges of Paracatu Basin. Vasconcelos (2010), when 
analyzing the study performed by Rodriguez (2008), re-
garding a comparison of the gauging station locations in 
relation to the irrigation areas, pointed that the existing 
gauging stations are located in the main river beds. These 
are far downstream from the tributaries used for irrigation, 
so that the readings from the gauging station already incor-
porate this usage, together with the discharge from larger 
tributaries. Thus, the impact of local irrigation is masked 
and is difficult to measure, although it reduces the bias in 
regional hydrological analyses.

Hydrograph separation

Nathan and McMahon (1990) and Albuquerque (2009) 
stated that the available hydrograph separation methods 
do not present a criterion that permits reliable delimitation 
of the subsurface flow, which is found in the hydrograph 
region between the base flow and surface discharge. To 
improve this situation, this study proposed combining the 
results of two recursive filters used as follows: calibrated 
in reference to the recession exponential curve for the dry 
season, more accurately corresponding to the base flow; 
and calibrated in reference to the influential point of runoff 
discharge using the Lynsley et al. (1975) empirical formu-
la, which corresponds to the sum of the base with the sub-
surface flow. Both parameters were calibrated so that they 
may attend the best possible approximation to the conven-
tional graphic projection models for the recession curve 
(Barnes, 1939), and the undulatory overlying of the hy-
drological response units (Su, 1995). In order to calibrate 
the runoff discharge point of influence, isolated rain peaks, 
without data gaps, were chosen to be in accordance with 
the empirical formula referred by Lynsley et al. (1975). 

The concept model for this type of hydrograph is presented 
in Figure 7.

Another problem found regarding the recursive filters 
is the mathematical possibility that the base flow estima-
tion is superior to the total discharge value for the river 
at some hydrograph periods. To overcome this problem, 
Gregor (2010) proposed that a cut should be done in the 
overestimated discharge at the end of the filter algorithm 
application. Whereas, Chapman (1999) suggested (al-
though not explicitly implements) that by using an inter-
nal constraint at each algorithmic iteration would provide 
greater consistency for the one-parameter filter. Adopting 
the recommendation from Chapman (1999), the follow-
ing logic restrictor was implemented: if base flow ? to-
tal discharge; then, maintain base flow values; if not, base 
flow equals total discharge.

Table 1 presents the tested filters. The option was for 
one-parameter filters because they could be more objec-
tively calibrated (Chapman, 1999).

Statistical procedures for the spatialization of the hy-
drogeological data in nested basins were based on its con-
catenation and overlap, in accordance with the methodol-
ogy used by Holtschlag (1997). This allowed to elaborate

ponents’ contribution towards the discharge at the stretch-
es of the nested basins of the Paracatu River.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Stationarity

The analyzed gauging stations obtained satisfactory re-
sults for stationarity tests regarding the discharge averages 
and variance at a 5% level of significance. Only station 
4286000 was rejected from the stationary variation of min-
imum events at a 5% level of significance; and 42365000 
was rejected for stationary variance of maximum events at 
a 5% level of significance. Only one of them had its aver-
age stationarity rejected at a 1% level of significance (pass-
ing the test at the 5% level). The rest of the rejections re-
ferred to variance at a 1% level. 

In cases where rejection occurred during the test, 
their patterns and tendencies were evaluated. An attempt 
was made to find the breaking point, i.e., the period that 
best demarcates the stationary difference in accordance 
with the standard deviation for the constraining peri-
ods. Hydrological data analysis shows a period of fre-
quent discharge peaks between 1976 and 1985, caus-
ing a different impact on each nested basin. Such data 
was in agreement with discharge studies done by plot-
ting of the average monthly hydrographs, performed 
by Carvalho et al. (2004) for the Paracatu River Basin. 
This flood interlinking elevated the historical variances 
of this period, reflecting on stationarity tests for vari-
ances at a level of 1%, especially in tests for maximum 
events. From 1994 until 2000, there is a lessening in the 
discharge variance of the rivers, provoking rejection in 
some stationarity tests at a 1% significance level. The 
gauging stations referring to basins of greater contribu-
tion (for example, those on the main bed of the Paracatu 
River), as expected, presented less interference on vari-
ance stationarity since they dampened the flooding ef-
fects (for maximum events) and had a possible effect 
from the regional hydrogeologic flow (for annual aver-
ages and minimum events).

In long-term stationarity tests (1957 – 2000), the four 
gauging stations were approved in the test for the average 
stationarity of the monthly discharge at a 1% level of sig-
nificance. For the stationarity test of variance, the effect of 
the flood peaks from 1976 to 1985 made three tests (one 
for monthly minimum, another for monthly average, and 
the last, for monthly maximum) fail the significance test 
at the 1% level — although they all passed at the 5% one. 
Analyses of the two test blocks for stationarity (one from 
1957, and the other from 1976) corroborated the statement 

that there was a period of lesser parameter variance from 
1957 to 1975, as well as from 1993 to 2000.

The good results concerning the stationarity tests for 
average discharge bring additional reliability for gap fill-
ing. Despite rejection of the stationarity hypothesis for 
variances at a significance level of 1%, it is believed 
that this break in stationarity does not present a manda-
tory impediment to the statistical procedures, consid-
ering the results presented in this study. Remember that 
stationary results for variance served as criteria for the se-
lection of support stations to fill in the gaps, generating 
a grouping of gauging stations under similar conditions. 
Nonetheless, the tests presented are as a safeguard for fu-
ture comparative studies.

Gap filling

As previously discussed, the available state-of-art method-
ological options for gap filling (EM and MI) seek a solu-
tion that is a compromise between forecast reliability and 
variance data maintenance. For base discharge separation 
(hydrogeological flow), the estimative results were ana-
lyzed with preference to a greater reliability for forecast-
ing from the data, keeping in mind that the data filled in 
will be utilized in mathematical-statistical models that are 
sensible to temporal correlation patterns.

Figures 8 and 9 present comparative examples of 
the results obtained by estimation using EM and MI. 
In Figure 8, a gap filling was simulated for an area and 
original data was used for comparison. For consistency in 
the MI data, a constraint was used for non-negative data. 
In both graphics, estimation using EM came closest to the 
original hydrograph. Figures 8 and 9 show how estima-
tion by MI, although following an average tendency, cre-
ated an abnormal variance that did not respect the tempo-
ral correlation of the hydrograph, corroborating with the 
theoretical caution proposed by Cano and Andreu (2010). 
Although the EM line in the graph of Figure 8 is slightly 
above the original hydrograph, the theoretic base of this 
method guarantees that in filled in periods as a whole, the 
average and discharge variance will be the closest possible 
approximation with original data.

For each gauging station, gap-filling values were con-
ferred by exploration through visual analysis of the dis-
charge graphs, assuring that the input data was consistent 
from a hydrological point of view and followed the trends 
of the support stations.

Flow component delimitation

The filters proposed by Chapman (1991) and Chapman 
and Maxwell (1996) presented similar results. However, 
they did not demonstrate hydrological reliability, because

the estimated base flow did not coincide with the recession 
curve during the annual dry season (Figure 10).

The filters mentioned by Lyne and Hollick (1979) 
and by Tularam and Ilahee (2008), after calibration, 
presented identical visual behaviors. Notwithstanding, 
the filter mentioned by Lyne and Hollick (1979) was 
chosen because it is the most widely found in lit-
erature (Lim et al., 2005; Combalicer et al., 2008; 
Asmeron, 2008; Santhi et al., 2008; Albuquerque, 2009; 
Welderufael and Woyessa, 2010; Biller, 2010), making 
it easier to compare with other studies.

The end of the N period (number of days after the 
hydrographic peak, when the runoff discharge participa-
tion ceased) of Lynsley et al. (1975) empirical equation 
coincided in a greater part of the hydrographs, with a 
change in the inclination of the depletion line for the rain 
peak, corroborating with the reliability of its application. 
Calibrating the filters with the combined double parame-
ters made it possible to clearly separate the interflow wave 
from the base one (Figure 11).

For the two stations of the isolated series (inferior to 
the period of the main block), a comparison of the chosen 
filter with the support stations was done during the same 
period for which a series of data was available. Following 
this, the results were compared with those for the com-
plete period (1976 – 2001). Average annual discharge 
value variation, base flow, interflow, and quick flow were 
used to adjust the respective results for the filter on the 
isolated series. The average adjustment for the basin data 
for station 42350000 (1974 – 1984) was -9%, while for 
42645000 (1973 – 1981), it was -0.63%.

The results of the calibrated application of the filter at 
each station and the concatenation of the drainage basins 
with the data concerning total discharge, quick flow, inter-
flow, and base flow, including the specific discharge, are 
presented in Tables 2 and 3. 

For comparison, Table 3 also presents the base flow in-
dex (BFI) as a result from hydrograph separation of some 
of the stations when using Barnes (1939) graphic method, 
performed by CETEC (1981) and RURALMINAS (1996).

for the hydrologic years from 1965 to 2005.

The delimitation in RURALMINAS (1996) was done for 
1939 to 1989, while the delimitation in CETEC (1981) 
used only one hydrological year, between 1969 and 1974 
for different stations. The BFI, which is equivalent to the 
division of the base flow by the total discharge, is rela-
tively stable at long term in basins, even with the annual 
discharge variations, which makes feasible the comparison 
between estimates of different periods (Santhi et al., 2008). 
Comparison of the estimated indexes from the recursive 
filters with the estimated base flow by graphic methods 
demonstrated similar tendencies. Notwithstanding, with 
data presented in Table 3, it is possible to perceive how the 
graphic method incorporates in different proportions 
the interflow in relation to the base flow in each basin, 
demonstrating the inherent subjectivity of this technique.

As can be seen in Table 2, the average of parame-
ters (?, as presented in Table 1) calibrated for the filters 
(in the two calibration forms) is superior to 0.925, which 
is referenced in literature (Nathan and McMahon, 1990; 
Ghanbarpour, Teimouri, Gholami, 2008). Despite the fact 
that the hydrological characteristics of Paracatu River 
Basin have their differences in relation to basins with a 
temperate climate, this study case generated a hypothesis 
that the lack of calibration for the influence of runoff dis-
charge, together with the inflexion of the recession curve, 

could have led the studies with filters, performed in pre-
existing ones, to overestimate the base flow discharge val-
ues. This is in agreement with Asmeron (2008), who stated 
that the 0.995 parameter seemed more coherent with the 
hydrographic curves for the Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia. 

Analysis of the specific discharge maps (Figure 12) col-
lated in Tables 2 and 3 shows that the base flow contribution 
is more significant at the headwaters of the basin because 
of heavier rainfall, especially in the western portion. This

configuration also reinforces the recharge role of the pla-
teaus that have a porous sedimentary lithology at the ba-
sin headwaters. As the stream flows downward towards the 
lowlands of the central area of Paracatu Basin, the base flow 
contribution becomes significantly less expressive. This re-
sult is also coherent with that related by Tucci (2002), who 
observed a specific discharge reduction as basin area in-
creased in many flow records of rivers in Brazil. 

However, it is interesting to note how certain increases 
in specific total discharge, base, and interflow occur after 
stations 42930000 (Lower Paracatu), 42490000 (Middle 
Preto River) and 42350000 (Lower Prata River). It is pos-
sible that there are regional underground flows crosscut-
ting below the station and surface downstream. This phe-
nomenon seems to mainly occur in areas that have shallow 
lateritic-debris porous aquifers, which receive water from 
Karstic-fissured aquifers.

As a final comment, it is necessary to recognize that the 
automatic hydrographic separation methods analyze only 
form patterns of waves representing discharge pulses, and 
as such, they do not directly identify the source of dis-
charge components. Therefore, the automatic method re-
sults are referred to hydrogeological processes only as the 
base flow, interflow, and quick flow really correspond to 
underground, subsurface, and runoff flows respectively. In 

this context, Kirchner (2003) and Gonzales et al. (2009) 
studies can be cited for demonstrating that the regional 
groundwater flow generally responds to rain as quickly as 
runoff does, due to the piston effect of precipitation in the 
recharge areas of the basin, while the clay soil of the low-
lands retards and dilutes the interflow for a more ample pe-
riod. In areas under Karstic influence, there is also a plau-
sible hypothesis in that the interflow partially corresponds 
to the endokarstic duct flow, even after runoff discharge 
has finished. These hypotheses bring forward a recommen-
dation that future studies with tracers could improve the 
understanding of hydrogeological processes involved.

CONCLUSIONS

The stationary analysis brought greater reliability to the 
knowledge about the Paracatu River Basin discharge. The 
discharge gap-filling measures estimation by EM were 
more reliable than those estimated by the MI for data from 
the gauging station series used in this study. However, 
scientific literature as well as management entities would 
greatly benefit if future studies involved a more compre-
hensive, systematic, quantitative, and comparative analy-
sis of EM and MI methods’ efficiency.

The Bflow (Lyne and Hollick, 1979) and EWMA 
(Tularam and Ilahee, 2008) filters demonstrated a be-
havior that was consistent for hydrograph separation. 
Chapman (1991) and Chapman and Maxwell (1996) fil-
ters did not behave consistently, since in several temporal 
segments, they did not match the recession curve during 
the dry season.

With the double calibration method presented in this 
study, it became possible to estimate more reliably the base 
flow, interflow, and quick flow. The logic restrictor did not 
permit overestimation of the discharge, increasing the con-
sistency of the results, which were coherent with Barnes 
(1939) manual graphic method, although the filters more 
reliably distinguished the difference between the base flow

and interflow. The values found for the Bflow filter param-
eters were superior to the standard ones found in literature. 
This could mean that the pre-existing studies with this fil-
ter might have overestimated the base flow, even when the 
subsurface flow was incorporated into their values.

As a suggestion for future studies, the methodology 
proposed in this article could be enhanced by algorithm 
developments for automatic calibration of the filters. The 
automatic identification of the recession curve’s inflection 

point is already performed by BFI algorithm (Wahl and 
Wahl, 1988, 1995), and Lynsley et al. (1975) empirical for-
mula is already incorporated in algorithms, such as Rora 
and Part (Rutledge, 1993, 1998).

The cartographic presentation of the specific discharge of 
the base flow and interflow of the downstream nested basins 
demonstrated coherency with studies and geo-referenced bas-
es from climatology and hydrogeology (Figures 4 and 5). The 
maps are useful products for watershed management.

The methodology developed for this study is easily 
replicable for other Brazilian basins, as well for those 
worldwide, whenever gauging station information is 
available. The reliability verification of its results, how-
ever, does not mean that a more extensive understand-
ing of the hydrological, hydrogeological, and climatic 
phenomena occurring at the basins is not necessary.
