Abstract

Techniques for the growth of artificial tissues often make use of a solid structure (known as scaffold)
which facilitates the spontaneous growth of the tissue. Commonly, these scaffolds are produced through
3D printing which is currently unable to meet the growing demand for artificial tissues. A novel approach
is to construct a system of colloidal particles that spontaneously aggregate with cells mediating the bonds.
With this technique, we avoid the need of an invasive surgery as the scaffold is constructed already inside
the body.
Through a set of mean-field rate equations and percolation theory, we show that suppressing the natural
adhesion between cells results in larger scaffolds that self-assemble faster. Simulations of two lattice
models using the kinetic Monte Carlo technique reveal how practitioners can tune the ratio of cells to
particles and the ratio of diffusion coefficients to obtain desired scaffold characteristics such as size,
interconnectivity, and assembly time. In particular, an optimal value of the ratio of cells to particles was
found such that a larger, more interconnected scaffold assembles faster.
We show also that aggregate diffusivity is crucial for the dynamics, having studied the limits in which
size does not effect diffusivity and in which diffusion of aggregates occurs on a much slower timescale
than the diffusion of particles and cells. For the former, an interval of the ratio of cells to particles
was found such that a giant aggregate that includes all particles forms, in agreement with some simple
calculations. For the latter, it was found that the average size of aggregates exhibits a bimodal shape
as a function of the ratio of cells to particles with two optimal values in the asymptotic limit. The
proposed mechanism involving the suppression of bonds between a portion of the particles is verified
with an analytical treatment and simulations. We show that the ratio of diffusion coefficients of cells and
particles can suppress these two optimal values through two distinct mechanisms.

Keywords: linker-mediated aggregation, cell dynamics, patchy colloids, self-assembly, scaffolds.

Resumo

Te?cnicas para a formac?a?o de tecido artificial muitas vezes fazem uso de uma estrutura so?lida (conhecida
como armac?a?o) que funciona como um substituto tempora?rio para a matriz extracelular, e facilita o
crescimento esponta?neo de tecido. Va?rias restric?o?es sa?o impostas sobre as armac?o?es, entre elas biocom-
patibilidade, biodegradabilidade e porosidade e resiste?ncia meca?nica adequadas.
Commumente, estas armac?o?es sa?o produzidas usando impressoras 3D, uma te?cnica que e? incapaz de sat-
isfazer a procura crescente de tecidos artificiais. A necessidade de impressa?o da armac?a?o fora do corpo
tem associada problemas te?cnicos referentes a? biocompatibilidade, assim como problemas econo?micos
devido a? necessidade de uma cirurgia. Uma te?cnica recentemente proposta consiste numa soluc?a?o in-
jeta?vel de part??culas coloidais que se auto-organizam para formar a armac?a?o desejada in situ, na?o sendo
necessa?ria uma intervenc?a?o me?dica invasiva. A superf??cie das part??culas coloidais e? biofuncionalizada
com anticorpos que interagem selectivamente com as ce?lulas que formam o tecido desejado. Ce?lulas
servem enta?o de mediador das ligac?o?es entre part??culas, que se agregam para formar a armac?a?o. As
ce?lulas mediadoras depois proliferam e formam o tecido usando a armac?a?o como a?ncora.
Como as ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas e part??culas sa?o efectivamente irrevers??veis, o balanc?o detalhado na?o e?
alcanc?ado e o formalismo da f??sica estat??stica de equil??brio e? incapaz de descrever adequadamente o
problema. Novos modelos e te?cnicas foram desenvolvidos de maneira a capturar a f??sica, que e? sens??vel
a? dina?mica tanto individual como coletiva. Neste trabalho, aumentou-se a complexidade dos modelos
gradualmente, permitindo o estudo detalhado do efeito de cada contribuic?a?o atrave?s de um modelo de
part??culas com vale?ncia limitada (patchy).
Numa primeira abordagem escreveu-se um sistema de equac?o?es de balanc?o para estudar a dina?mica das
ce?lulas na presenc?a e ause?ncia da adesa?o natural entre ce?lulas. Definiu-se uma probabilidade de ligac?a?o
entre patches e uma distribuic?a?o do nu?mero de ligac?o?es, ambas estudadas analiticamente e numerica-
mente. No caso da ause?ncia de ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas, foi poss??vel resolver as equac?o?es analiticamente
para um intervalo de para?metros e uma aproximac?a?o foi desenvolvida que recupera as soluc?o?es para outro
intervalo. No caso da presenc?a de ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas, estudou-se tambe?m a dina?mica de agregados de
ce?lulas.
Em ambos os casos, foi descoberto que o nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula e? crucial para a dina?mica,
limitando o nu?mero de ligac?o?es atrave?s do defeito ou excesso de ce?lulas. Encontrou-se um valor o?timo
para o nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula que maximiza a probabilidade de ligac?a?o quando as ligac?o?es entre
ce?lulas esta?o ausentes. Como e? preciso um patch com ce?lula e outro sem ce?lula, este valor o?timo e? tal
que o nu?mero de ce?lulas e? metade do nu?mero de patches. Encontrou-se tambe?m que a raza?o entre os
coeficientes de difusa?o de ce?lulas e part??culas controla a competic?a?o entre ce?lulas com uma ou nenhuma
ligac?a?o pelos patches livres, servindo como para?metro de controlo para a probabilidade assinto?tica de
ligac?a?o. O coeficiente de difusa?o das part??culas e? func?a?o do seu tamanho e pode enta?o ser ajustado para
obter a armac?a?o desejada.
Comparando os dois modelos, descobriu-se que o modelo sem ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas resulta em armac?o?es

v



maiores e mais interligadas que se auto-organizam em menos tempo. Este resultado na?o so? tem interesse
do ponto do vista teo?rico como permite experimentalmente produzir armac?o?es mais eficazes e menos
prova?veis de sofrer influe?ncias indesejadas pela bioatividade do meio envolvente. Finalmente, aplicou-
se percolac?a?o de campo me?dio para obter o intervalo de para?metros no qual a armac?a?o forma um gel.
Estudaram-se os efeitos das correlac?o?es espaciais entre agregados atrave?s de um modelo de rede que foi
resolvido numericamente, usando-se uma variante de kinetic Monte Carlo com rejeic?o?es. Esta te?cnica
baseia-se na listagem de eventos poss??veis (difusa?o para vizinhos) e seleciona a part??cula/ce?lula que
difunde com uma probabilidade proporcional a? taxa de difusa?o de part??culas/ce?lulas (fixada no in??cio da
simulac?a?o e proporcional ao coeficiente de difusa?o).
No modelo de rede, os agregados sa?o a?rvores e pontuais; o tamanho dos agregados e? contabilizado
atrave?s de duas probabilidades de ligac?a?o. Estudou-se em detalhe o efeito da difusividade dos agrega-
dos. O limite onde o tamanho de um agregado na?o tem efeito sobre a sua difusividade mostra forte
depende?ncia no nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula. Tre?s regimes foram identificados tendo em conta o seu
estado assinto?tico; num deles, todas as part??culas formam um u?nico agregado. Este resultado e? impor-
tante para os experimentalistas pois e? necessa?rio uma armac?a?o macrosco?pica para se formar um tecido
sauda?vel. Um ca?lculo simples recupera esta partic?a?o do espac?o de para?metros usando apenas a condic?a?o
de agregados serem a?rvores. Nos outros dois regimes, encontrou-se a forma funcional da distribuic?a?o
de tamanhos dos agregados, mostrando que ela tem uma cauda exponencial e portanto um tamanho
me?dio bem-definido. Estudou-se tambe?m o efeito da raza?o entre os coeficientes de difusa?o de ce?lulas e
part??culas, onde se verificou que controla o estado assinto?tico para um dos regimes apenas.
O limite onde a difusa?o de agregados ocorre numa escala de tempo muito mais lenta que a de part??culas
e ce?lulas mostra fenomenologia distinta. No limite onde ce?lulas difundem muito mais rapidamente que
part??culas, o estado assinto?tico mostra um tamanho me?dio de agregados com forma bimodal, com dois
valores o?timos do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula na?o-triviais, precedido por um estado transiente com
apenas um valor o?timo (correspondente ao descoberto anteriormente). Estes valores o?timos correspon-
dem a?s fronteiras do intervalo do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula em que na?o ha? part??culas livres no
estado assinto?tico. Definiu-se a distribuic?a?o de patches com ce?lula dos mono?meros e comprovou-se que
era uma binomial. Como e? necessa?rio um patch com ce?lula e um sem ce?lula para se formar uma ligac?a?o,
part??culas sem patches com ce?lulas na?o pode formar ligac?o?es com outras part??culas com nenhum patch
com ce?lula. O mesmo com part??culas com nenhum patch sem ce?lula. A impossibilidade destas ligac?o?es
leva aos ma?ximos encontrados. Um modelo simples de campo me?dio reproduz a posic?a?o e altura dos
ma?ximos sem qualquer para?metro de ajuste.
Um segundo modelo de rede foi proposto e implementado com a te?cnica kinetic Monte Carlo. Neste
modelo, cada part??cula ocupa um lugar de rede, permitindo o estudo do efeito da forma dos agregados.
Apenas se estudou o limite dos agregados muito mais lentos que part??culas. Encontrou-se a mesma forma
bimodal (com um ligeiro desvio em relac?a?o ao modelo descrito anteriormente), o que permitiu concluir
que a forma na?o e? relevante para o mecanismo proposto.
Tomando o limite inverso onde mono?meros difundem muito mais ra?pido que ce?lulas, descobriu-se que os
ma?ximos desaparecem. Devido a corresponderem a mecanismos diferentes, os ma?ximos desaparecem a
valores diferentes de escalas de tempo de difusa?o. Um dos mecanismos surge quando as ce?lulas difundem
mais rapidamente que as part??culas e consiste numa reduc?a?o efetiva do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula,
aumentando o nu?mero de d??meros. Este mecanismo so? faz desaparecer um dos ma?ximos. O segundo
ma?ximo desaparece apenas quando as part??culas difundem muito mais rapidamente que as ce?lulas, limite
em que d??meros e ce?lulas sa?o efectivamente esta?ticos quando comparados com as part??culas. Devido a?
dificuldade de formac?a?o de ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas e d??meros, o tamanho me?dio dos agregados diminui.

vi



Ambos os mecanismos resultam enta?o no aumento do nu?mero de d??meros no estado assinto?tico.
Estudou-se a interconectividade dos agregados atrave?s da proporc?a?o de ligac?o?es que sa?o loops, desco-
brindo um valor o?timo do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula. Este valor o?timo corresponde ao valor o?timo
que maximiza o tamanho me?dio dos agregados no estado transiente, e e? explicado usando a distribuic?a?o
de patches com ce?lula. Um estudo dos efeitos de tamanho finito e? realizado.
Conclu??mos com um estudo do efeito da densidade de ce?lulas e part??culas. Os modelos de rede sa?o
va?lidos apenas no limite de densidade baixas onde encontra?mos uma relac?a?o linear entre a densidade e
altura dos ma?ximos do tamanho me?dio dos agregados.

Introduction

In the field of tissue engineering, the use of scaffolds is a popular technique to aid in the regeneration of
damaged tissues in vivo and to produce artificial tissues in vitro [2]. A scaffold is a micrometric solid
structure to which healthy cells can adhere. As time passes, the cells that form bonds to the scaffold
proliferate, increasing the cell population. The role of the scaffold is of an anchor, accelerating the
process of tissue growth as well as defining its overall shape [3].
As the scaffold is meant as a temporary replacement for the naturally occurring extracellular matrix, it
must follow several restrictions: a key characteristic in avoiding rejection is biocompatibility; cells must
be able to adhere to it and function as under natural conditions; it must be biodegradable, as scaffolds
are intended as temporary structures that form autonomous tissues and are eventually disassembled by
the body; it must be rigid enough so as to withstand mechanical perturbations; finally it must be porous
enough for both cells and nutrients to be able to penetrate the scaffold. Healthy tissue requires cell
adhesion on the outskirts of the scaffold as well as inside its pores [2–8].
To grow a structure that copes with these requirements at the micrometer scale, one usually makes use
of a 3D printer to create a cage-like structure which is then transplanted into the patient. There are many
drawbacks regarding this method. 3D-printing such small objects is very expensive and currently not
suitable for large-scale industrial production, as different types of scaffolds require entirely different pro-
duction processes and equipment. Also, a scaffold produced this way must be printed in a laboratory and
only afterwards be inserted into the patient [9]. This brings about many new challenges concerning the
biocompatibility and structural integrity of the scaffold. The need for a surgery imposes an economical
bottleneck for the widespread use of scaffolds as it is not sufficient to create scaffold production lines.
Skilled labor and equipment in the form of a surgeon and a hospital are also required [2, 4, 10].
An alternative fabrication technique that would reduce the requirements has been proposed by the group
of J. F. Mano, at the University of Aveiro. The idea is to functionalize the surface of chitosan particles
with antibodies, selected so as to form bonds only to the cells that will make up the tissue and not to each
other [1]. This procedure ensures direct bonds between particles cannot occur, instead requiring a cell
as mediator. These particles are injected directly into the afflicted area, where they diffuse alongside the
cells, recruiting them and forming indirect particle-particle bonds. The resulting self-assembled structure
will serve as a scaffold and, having formed itself inside the body, no preparation related to transportation
is needed. There is no need to manually craft the scaffold in a printer as the system spontaneously
self-organizes into the desired structure. The cells mediating the bonds also proliferate, serving the dual
purpose of building the tissue as well as the scaffold. Typically cell division only occurs after the scaffold
is formed [1, 11].
As the typical cell-particle bond energies are much higher than the thermal energy found inside the hu-

antibodies which selectively interact with the target cells. The injectable solution forms a scaffold in situ [1].

man body [12], the characteristic time needed for a bond to break is much greater than the relevant
experimental timescale. As the formation of bonds is effectively irreversible, detailed balance is broken
and standard equilibrium statistical physics concepts and methods fail to provide an adequate descrip-
tion of the problem. As the system does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium, both the collective and
individual dynamics are crucial for an understanding of the problem, requiring novel techniques to be
developed, and making our work stand out from previous studies on aggregation with linkers [13]. Be-
cause correlations in time are important, there will be high sensitivity to variables such as concentration
and diffusion coefficient of particles and cells; different models with differing degrees of complexity
will be presented with the goal of characterizing the influence of each added feature. Our work can
guide experiments and help to find new phenomena as theoretical studies can explore more efficiently
the configuration space and isolate the effect of each separate feature of the problem.

There are many features of the experimental motivation that are physically relevant and must be included
in our theoretical description. Both cells and particles are suspended in a fluid and diffuse due to micro-
scopic collisions with the fluid molecules. Both particles and free cells can be approximated as spherical.
As seen in Fig. 1.2, cells (radius ? 10µm) are much smaller than particles (radius ? 100µm), so their
diffusion coefficient is much larger. The surface of the particles is engineered with functional groups
which selectively interact with cells when they coming upon a certain distance of each other. This al-
lows cells to mediate particle-particle bonds, which are taken to be irreversible. Due to the small size
of cells when compared to the size of particles, and due to cells flattening upon adhesion [14], the case
where a cell adheres to more than two particles is very unlikely, allowing us to model cells as colloidal

particles with two patches. The maximum coordination number a 3D compact structure of equal spheres
may have is twelve [15], as seen in a cubic close-packed or an hexagonal close-packed configuration of
hard spheres. The case studied in this work does not include an exterior driving force that compresses
the particles together. As such, we consider particles to have only six patches, one for each direction
in 3D space. The cells adhere to the antibodies which cover the surface of the particles. There are
many antibodies in the surface, but only six orientations are taken to be relevant for cell-mediated bonds,
consequently many cells mediate the bond between two particles. A rescaling of the cell number den-
sity, corresponding to bonds that are exclusively between one particle patch and one cell patch, greatly
simplifies the model.
Cells tend to adhere to each other, a behavior that can be suppressed chemically. This suppression will
not hinder tissue growth as it is not genetically encoded in the cells, and will not be inherited upon cell
division. As scaffold assembly is typically much faster than cell division, only chemically treated cells
take part in the process. Cell dynamics, including the effect of suppressing cell-cell bonds is studied in
chapter 2 through mean-field rate equations. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce lattice models which reveal the
role of correlations between aggregates and patches, respectively. Finally, some conclusions are drawn
in chapter 4.

Chapter 2

Mean-field balance equations

Let us consider a system of colloidal particles and cells. The particles are spherical and their surface is
functionalized with six patches. Due to the interaction of the particles with the surrounding fluid, they
exhibit rotational and translational Brownian motion with diffusion coefficients Dr and Dp, respectively.
As particles are much larger than the fluid molecules, there is a separation of timescales between the
diffusion of fluid molecules and the one of particles, and thus the interaction with the fluid is considered
uncorrelated in space and time within the timescale we are interested in. We neglect hydrodynamic
interactions between particles mediated by the solvent and caused by motion-induced flow fields, which
are weak at large distances between particles [16]. We instead describe the pairwise interaction between
particles with an isotropic, short-range, repulsive potential.

Cells are considered isotropic and spherical, exhibiting the same translational Brownian motion as parti-
cles, but with a different diffusion coefficient. Two models will be studied for cell-cell interactions, both
of which neglect hydrodynamic interactions. In the model studied in section 2.1, there is an isotropic
short-range repulsion between the cells and thus cell-cell adhesion is neglected; in the model studied in
section 2.2, there is an isotropic short-range attraction which mimics cell-cell adhesion.

Cells and particle patches interact with an isotropic, short-range, attractive potential, the depth of which
is much lower than the thermal energy. Particles and cells form irreversible bonds as the characteristic
time for bond breaking is much longer than the relevant timescale. The mechanism for aggregation is
the formation of particle-particle bonds mediated by one or more cells, as direct bonds between particles
cannot occur. A cell (or cell aggregate) can form a bond with two patches at most, each belonging to a
different particle.

In the experimental motivation, the antibodies to which cells form bonds are much smaller than cells
and are well spread-out across the surface of particles, and so cells can cover the entire surface of the
particle. The maximum number of cells that can form a bond to a particle is given by ?p/?c, where ?p
is the average surface area of a particle and ?c is the average covering area of a cell after it adheres to a
particle. The covering area ?c is different than the surface area of a free cell, as cells spread on substrates
upon adhesion in a highly complex way [14]. The condition of the patchy colloid model stating that
patches can form bonds to only one cell is a useful simplification, as it is not necessary to consider the
mediation of more than one cell since bonds are irreversible, and consequently a portion of the cells do
not play a role in the dynamics. The mapping from the experimental motivation to the patchy colloid
model thus implies an effective number density of cells. In the patchy colloid model, the maximum
number of cells that can form a bond to a particle is f. The rescaling of the number density of cells is

thus given by

where Cmodel and Creal are the rescaled and the real number densities respectively. Henceforth, all
references to densities correspond to the rescaled number densities instead of the real number densities
in the experiments.
In this chapter, we start by studying the dynamics of the cells. We assume that the diffusion promotes
a homogeneous distribution of cells and patches, such that density fluctuations in space are short-lived
compared to the average time between cell-particle interactions, and that the distribution of patches
is uncorrelated in space and time. Therefore, in the timescale relevant to the dynamics, densities are
assumed to be constant in space (mean field). After a study of the dynamics of cells, we combine the
results with mean-field percolation to study the aggregation of particles.

Figure 2.1: Illustration of the possible reactions when cell-cell bonds are suppressed: a) bond between a free cell and a free
patch, resulting in an occupied patch; b) bond between an occupied patch and a free patch, resulting in a particle-particle bond.

We first look to the dynamics of cells when cell-cell bonds are suppressed. The only bonds that are
possible are cell-particle bonds. We define ?(t) as the density of patches that do not form a bond to cells
(free patches), C0(t) the density of cells that do not form a bond to patches (free cells), C1(t) the density
of cells forming bonds with only one patch (occupied patches), and C2(t) the density of cells forming
bonds with two patches (particle-particle bonds). We write down a set of balance equations to describe
the dynamics, ???????

C0 (described by equation (2.2a)) always decreases as free cells form bonds with free patches and no
bond is broken (see Fig. 2.1 a)). C1 (described by eq. (2.2b)) increases with the formation of free
cell-patch bonds and decreases with the formation of bonds between occupied patches and free patches
(see Fig. 2.1 b)). C2 (described by eq. (2.2c)) always increases as occupied patches form bonds with
free patches and no bond may be broken. The cells act as linkers between particles, mediating particle-
particle bonds. ? (described by eq. (2.2d)) always decreases as free cells and occupied patches form
bonds with free patches and no bond is broken. We have introduced two constants: k0, which is the rate

at which free cells form bonds with free patches; and k1, which is the rate at which occupied patches
form bonds to free patches. These constants are determined by the diffusion coefficient of particles and
cells. As we neglect correlations, even those in the same particle, we use the 3D coalescence reaction
rate K between two species of diffusing, spherical, and isotropic particles [17, 18] in order to relate the
reaction rates k0 and k1 with the diffusion coefficients and radii of cells and particles,

K = 4?(D1 + D2)(R1 + R2), (2.3)

where D1, D2, R1 and R2 are the diffusion coefficients and radii of the two species respectively. Since a
patch can form a bond with only one cell, we assume the radius of the patches is of the same order as the
radius of the cells. The diffusion coefficients of spherical isotropic particles Di depend on their radius
Ri, as predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relation [19]

Di =
kBT

8?? Ri
, (2.4)

where ? is the viscosity of the suspending medium and T is the thermostat temperature. Since cells
are one order of magnitude smaller than the particles, we may approximate the diffusion coefficient of
occupied patches by the diffusion coefficient of particles. Using eqs. (2.3) and (2.4):

k0 = 4?(Dc + Dp)(Rc + Rc) =

with Dc and Rc referring to cells and Dp and Rp referring to particles. We introduce k

cells and free patches. From eqs. (2.5a) and (2.5b)

Note that k ?]0, 2[. If k &amp;lt;1, particles are larger than cells; if k &gt; 1, cells are larger than particles. In
the experiments Rp ? 10Rc (k ? 0.1), and so we are interested in the case k &amp;lt;1. We rescale time
(t ? k0t) and choose units of volume such that the system occupies unitary volume, obtaining:???????

C?0 = ?C0?,
C?1 = C0??kC1?,
C?2 = kC1?,

?? = ?C0??kC1?.

(2.8d)

The rate constant k0 therefore sets the timescale and k determines the dynamics. k is a major control
parameter as it sets the competition for free patches between free cells and occupied patches. Increasing
k increases the rate of formation of occupied patch/free patch bonds in relation to free cell/free patch

bonds.

As initial conditions, we assume that all cells and particles are free and uniformly distributed. We define
n as the density of particles and f as the number of patches per particle, thus

?(0) = nf. (2.9)

As discussed previously, we take f = 6 hereafter. We also introduce ?, which is defined as the ratio
between free cells and free patches in the initial state,

? =
C0(0)

?(0)
, (2.10)

and,

C0(0) = C, (2.11)

C1(0) = 0, (2.12)

C2(0) = 0, (2.13)

?(0) =
C

. (2.14)

Figure 2.2 shows the numerical solution of eqs. (2.8a)–(2.8d). If ? &amp;lt;0.5, there are enough patches for
all cells to form two bonds (C2(?) = C), as seen in Fig. 2.2 a). Since k ? 1, there is a separation of
timescales: the time needed for cells to form one bond is much smaller than the time needed for them to
form a second bond, leading to the prolonged tail in C1. If ? &gt; 0.5, the dynamics cease when all free
patches form a bond (?(?) = 0), as in Fig. 2.2 b). In this case, C0(?), C1(?), and C2(?) depend
on k. If k ? 1, free cells are much faster than occupied patches, exhausting all patches before occupied
patches can become particle-particle bonds

(
C1(?) &gt; C0(?)

)
. If k = 1, as in Fig. 2.2 c), the two rates

are the same and the two reactions compete. Eventually, the total rate of free cells turning into occupied
patches equals the one of occupied patches turning into particle-particle bonds and C?1(t) = 0.

Combining eqs. (2.8a)–(2.8c), we get a conservation equation for cells:

C?0 + C?1 + C?2 = 0 ? C0 + C1 + C2 = C, (2.15)

where C is the total density of cells, which is constant. Combining eqs. (2.8a), (2.8b), and (2.8d), we get
a conservation equation for patches:

?? = C?1 + 2C?0 ? ??C1 ? 2C0 = ?0, (2.16)

with ?0 being a constant. If C &amp;lt;?(0), the dynamics ceases when all cells have two bonds, C0 = C1 = 0
and ? = ?0. ?0 is the density of free patches after all cells form two bonds. If ?0 &amp;lt;0, there are not
enough patches for all cells to form two bonds and dynamics saturate due to a lack of patches rather than
a lack of cells. From eqs. (2.12)–(2.14) and (2.16), we obtain

?0 =

We can combine eqs. (2.8a) and (2.8b) to obtain an equation for C1 as function of C0 (this is possible

To characterize the self-assembled structure, we look to the bond probability pb, defined as the proba-
bility that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond to another patch. This probability is a measure of how
well-connected the structure is, as it determines the average number of cell-mediated bonds per particle.
In section 2.4, the influence of pb on the structure is discussed in more detail. pb is given, in the thermo-
dynamic limit, by the fraction of patches involved in indirect particle-particle bonds. As there are two
involved patches per particle-particle bond, this fraction is given by

pb(t) =

which is independent of k. The general case is solved numerically and the results are shown in Fig. 2.4.
The predicted linear regime can be seen in Fig. 2.4 a). For ? &gt; 0.5 there are not enough patches for
all cells to form two bonds. Competition between free cells and occupied patches arises and is tunable
through k. As k = k1/k0 increases, the rate of occupied patches turning into particle-particle bonds

increases in relation to free cells turning into occupied patches. Consequently, there are more particle-
particle bonds in the final state. The limit k ? 0 corresponds to all free cells forming bonds before any
occupied patch can find a free patch. The asymptotic pb is thus symmetric with respect to ? = 0.5,

The limit k ? ? corresponds to occupied patches forming bonds with free patches as soon as they are
formed. In the asymptotic state, pb is maximized for ? = 0.5, which is also the case where pb grows the
fastest, as seen in Fig. 2.4 b).
The probability that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond with another patch depends on both k and ?.
The size and density of cells are system dependent. The ratio of cells to patches ? can be controlled by
adjusting the density of particles in the injectable solution. The ratio of rate constants k can be controlled
by adjusting the radius of the particles, which we manufacture in the lab. It was also shown that the time
needed for the scaffold to assemble can be fine-tuned, further showcasing the versatility of this method
and the richness of its dynamics.

2.2 With cell-cell adhesion

Let us now consider the case where cells can adhere to each other. Thus, multiple cells can adhere to the
same patch and aggregates composed only of cells that have not formed bonds to any patch are possible.
Cell-cell adhesion is taken to be irreversible. We keep the definition of ?(t) as the density of free patches,

12



Figure 2.5: Illustration of the possible reactions when cell-cell bonds are allowed: a) Bond between a free cell/cell aggregate
and a free patch, resulting in an occupied patch; b) bond between an occupied patch and a free patch, resulting in a particle-
particle bond; c) bond between free cells/cell aggregates, effectively decreasing C0; d) bond between an occupied patch and a
free cell/cell aggregate; e) bond between occupied patches, resulting in a particle-particle bond.

however C0(t) is now the density of free cells and cell aggregates not forming a bond to a patch, C1(t)
is the density of patches that form a bond to at least one cell (occupied patches), and C2(t) the density of
bonds between two patches (mediated by one or more cell). Of importance is the fact that C0 + C1 + C2
is not conserved. As cells are much smaller than particles, we consider that cell aggregates have the same
radius and the same diffusion coefficient as a single cell. C0 is thus the sum of the densities of free cells
and cell aggregates, and C1 is the effective density of occupied patches. The equations are as follows:?????????

All terms in eqs. (2.2a)–(2.2d) appear in eqs. (2.38a)–(2.38d) (see Fig. 2.5 a) and b)), with more terms
being included as new mechanisms are present. The second term in (2.38a) accounts for the adhesion of
multiple cells to the same patch (see Fig. 2.5 d)) and the third term accounts for the formation of cell
aggregates (effectively removing free cells, see Fig. 2.5 c)). The factor of 1

2
comes from the fact that

two cell aggregates/free cells merge to form a larger cell aggregate. The third term in eq. (2.38b) and the
second term in eq. (2.38c) reflect the possibility of forming bonds between occupied patches (mediated
by one or more cells, see Fig. 2.5 e)). The factor of 1

2
comes from the fact that, for every two occupied

patches that form a bond, only one particle-particle bond is formed.

The rates k0 and k1 are given by eqs (2.5a) and (2.5b); k2 is the reaction rate of cell aggregates/free cells
with themselves and it is not independent of k0 and k1:

k2 = 4?(Dc + Dc)(Rc + Rc) = 2

Allowing cell-cell adhesion (bonds) means that even two occupied patches can form cell-mediated bonds,
and that increasing ? cannot decrease the density of particle-particle bonds. We may obtain an estimation
for pb(?) in the fast cell limit (Dc ? Dp) if we neglect cell aggregation (and thus dropping out the third
term in eq. (2.40a)). Let P be the total number of patches and C be the total number of cells. In the fast
cell limit one can split the dynamics into two timescales: one where only cells diffuse and one where
only particles diffuse. After the first regime, the probability p0 that a patch does not form a bond to any
cell after randomly assigning C cells to all patches is

p0 =

(
P ? 1
P

)C
, (2.41)

where we neglected correlations between patches and distributed cells uniformly. In the thermodynamic
limit (infinite system)

lim
P??

p0 = e
??. (2.42)

In the second regime, occupied patches form cell-mediated bonds with other free or occupied patches.
In order to calculate the number of free patches after the second regime, we construct a system of rate
equations. Let ?0 be the number of free patches and ?1 be the number of occupied patches. Then,

{
??0 = ?Q?0?1
??1 = ?Q?0?1 ?Q?21,

(2.43a)

(2.43b)

where Q is a constant reaction rate. The initial conditions are

{
?0(0) = ?p0

?1(0) = ?(1 ?p0).
(2.44a)

(2.44b)

We have solved this system of equations to obtain the asymptotic value of ?0. In this limit, the value of
Q is irrelevant.

??0 = lim
t??

?0 = ? exp[1 ? exp(?) ??]. (2.45)

We can now calculate pb:

pb =
????0
?

= 1 ? exp[1 ??? exp(?)]. (2.46)

As can be seen in Fig. 2.6 a), the approximation of neglecting cell aggregates of eq. (2.46) predicts
higher values of pb than the ones obtained numerically from solving eqs. (2.40a)–(2.40d). This is be-
cause cell aggregates effectively reduce the number of possible particle-particle bonds. There is better
agreement for low values of ?.

In order to study the effects of cell aggregation, we split eq. (2.38a) into two equations. One equation
describes the density of free cells Cf , and the other describes the density of cell aggregates Cc. The two
are such that Cf + Cc = C0. As for eqs. (2.2a)–(2.2d) and (2.38a)–(2.38d),???

(2.47a)

(2.47b)

The first two terms in eqs. (2.47a) and (2.47b) relate to free cells and cell aggregates forming bonds with
free and occupied patches, respectively (see Fig. 2.7 a)-d)). The third term in eqs. (2.47a) and (2.47b)
refers to the formation of cell aggregates (see Fig. 2.7 e)). Cell aggregates grow by capturing other cell
aggregates and free cells, as reflected in the fourth term in eqs. (2.47a) and (2.47b) (see Fig. 2.7 f) and
g)).

While both Cc and Cf tend to zero, the proportion of C0 in the form of cell aggregates saturates to a
constant value that depends on ? (see Fig. 2.8). The ratio increases as ? increases, as there are less
patches per cell, being more likely for free cells to find each other before they find free patches. The
ratio decreases with k; as free cells diffuse slower in relation to particles, it is less likely that free cells
find each other before finding a free patch.

2.3 Comparison between the two mechanisms

We now compare the two mechanisms in order to determine if suppressing cell-cell adhesion is an advan-
tage for scaffold production. We have found that suppressing cell-cell adhesion results in higher values of
pb for values of ? lower than some threshold value ??(t), meaning that less cells are required in order to
obtain the same bond probability. When allowing cell adhesion, many cells form cell aggregates and/or
adhere to occupied patches, and so not every cell is used for forming bonds between particles, effectively
lowering the value of ? as some are redundant. The threshold ratio of cells to patches ??(?) in the fast
cell limit can be approximated using eqs. (2.37a), where we neglect cell aggregates, and eq. (2.46). The
approximated ??(?) is such that

1 ? 2??(?) + exp
{

1 ???(?) ? exp
[
??(?)

]}
= 0, (2.48)

which has the numerical solution ??(?) ? 0.615. The numerical solution of eqs. (2.2a)–(2.2d) and
(2.38a)–(2.38d) in the asymptotic limit, is displayed in Fig. 2.9 a). The threshold ratio of cells to patches
??(?) is robust with changes in k, varying weakly around 0.649. Because the curves pb(?) for each
mechanism increase roughly the same with k, their intersection at ??(?) is robust. In Fig. 2.9 b), we see
that ??(t) always begins at zero, but whether it monotonically increases or not depends on k. Allowing
cell-cell adhesion may initially connect scaffolds faster, but suppressing it for ? . ?? will eventually
result in larger scaffolds.
Bond probability pb is maximized in the suppressed cell-cell adhesion case for ? = 0.5, for which a
significant gain is obtained when compared with allowing cell-cell adhesion. This gain increases as
k decreases, as seen in Fig. 2.10. The mechanism that optimizes scaffold production is the one in
which cell-cell adhesion is suppressed. This mechanism optimizes the density of particle-particle bonds,
making for a larger scaffold that self-assembles faster. Henceforth, we will consider only the suppressed
cell-cell adhesion model.

2.4 Percolation properties (mean-field)

nodes and edges represent the aggregate. Image adapted from Cadilhe et al. (2007) [20].

Given the bond probability pb obtained in section 2.1, it is possible to study the aggregation of the
particles. We generalize to a case of particles with f patches. We neglect redundant bonds that link an
aggregate to itself (loops). Aggregates are thus tree-like and cutting any bond causes the aggregate to
split into two. Cell-mediated bonds are taken to be uncorrelated, every patch having the same probability

18



pb of being linked to a patch of a different particle. Spatial correlations are neglected, a particle can form
bonds to any other particle, so long as they do not exceed f bonds. Neglecting correlations corresponds
to taking the limit of infinite spatial dimensions (mean-field percolation). The Bethe lattice, a graph in
which all nodes have f neighbors and no loops are formed (see Fig 2.11 a)) is a lattice representation
of such a geometry [21]. An aggregate can thus be represented as a subset of the Bethe lattice in which
nodes are particles and edges are bonds (see Fig 2.11 b) and c)).

Depending on pb, there will be two phases, one in which there is a gel, an aggregate that spans the entire
system (in the thermodynamic limit, it is infinite); and one where no gel is present. The order parameter
is the fraction of particles present in the gel S(pb), which is non-zero only when there is a gel. Gelation
occurs at bond probabilities higher than a critical bond probability p?b [22]. On average, the number of
bonds leading out of a particle is (f ? 1)pb. In order to have an infinite system (see Fig 2.11 c) ) , the
number of bonds leading out of any particle must be larger or equal than one on average, where equality
is the condition for the critical point [23],

p?b =
1

f ? 1
. (2.49)

For f = 6 as in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the critical probability is 1/5. Forming a scaffold requires gelation,
as multiple disconnected aggregates do not provide the needed mechanical rigidity. In Fig. 2.12 a), we
can see systems with ? &amp;lt;0.1 never form a scaffold. The interval of ? at which there is gelation has an
upper-bound which is dependent on k, which means particles can be fabricated such that there is gelation
even at high values of ?. Furthermore, it is possible to determine the time at which the gel is formed as
function of ?, k0 and k1.

The existence of a gel does not require all particles of the system to belong to it. The fraction of particles
in the giant aggregate S varies continuously from zero to one, and can provide information over the
rheological and structural properties of the gel. As S increases, its surface area increases and the size of
its pores decrease. Defining u as the probability that a random patch does not lead to the giant aggregate,
the probability that a particle is not connected to the giant aggregate is uf . As S is the probability that a
particle is part of the giant aggregate,

S = 1 ?uf. (2.50)

If a patch does not lead to the giant aggregate, either it forms no bond at all (with probability 1 ? pb),
or it leads to a particle that is also not part of the giant aggregate through other bonds (with probability
pbu

f?1). The sum of the two probabilities is the probability u.

u = 1 ?pb + pbuf?1, (2.51)

uniquely determining the function u(pb) and, combined with eq. (2.50), determining the function S(pb).
However, from eq. (2.51), it is not possible to obtain u(pb) analytically for a generic value of f, and we
must resort to numerical methods, as in Fig. 2.12 b). The phase transition at pb = 1/5 is clearly visible,
corresponding to the critical values of ? = {0.1, 0.9} (in the limit k ? 0). S(pb) saturates quickly;
increasing pb above 1/2 does not change the connectivity of the gel appreciably.

The rate eqs. (2.2a)–(2.2d), combined with eqs. (2.50) and (2.51), provide a theory that describes both
the dynamics of the cells and of the scaffold as a whole. When developing it, we have always neglected
correlations, which will lead to significant deviations from experiments on systems that are densely-
packed, gelled, etc. In chapter 3, we introduce spatial correlations and study their effect through a lattice

Chapter 3

Lattice model

Figure 3.1: Illustration of the possible reactions of the lattice model: a) bond between a cell and an aggregate leads to a free
patch becoming occupied; b) bond between two aggregates uses a free and occupied patch. All other patches remain accessible.

In chapter 2, we studied the dynamics of a 3D system of colloidal particles and cells through a mean-field
set of rate equations. The mean-field approach neglects spatial correlations; to study their effect, we now
discuss a lattice version of our model. Henceforth, particles are referred to as monomers. For simplicity,
the term ”aggregate” will include monomers. The size of an aggregate is defined as the number of
monomers in it; free monomers are aggregates of size one.

Monomers occupy a lattice space and move by a sequence of random hops to their nearest neighbors.
The hopping rate is related to the diffusion coefficient Dm. Monomers have f patches on their surface,
which is the maximum number of bonds they can form. A patch can be free and form no bond or it can
be occupied and form an irreversible bond to a cell. A patch cannot be occupied by more than one cell. A
lattice space cannot be occupied by more than one monomer. The density of monomers nm is defined as
the ratio of lattice spaces occupied by monomers at t = 0. We study the very diluted regime (nm ? 1),
and neglect the aggregate shape and orientation, as the characteristic time for aggregates to find each
other is much larger than the timescale of rotational diffusion. We thus consider patches belonging to the
same aggregate to be uncorrelated.

21



As in the previous chapter, there is a second species, the cells. Cells occupy a lattice space and hop
with a rate related to their diffusion coefficient Dc. A lattice space can be occupied by at most one cell.
The density of cells nc is defined as the ratio of lattice spaces occupied by cells at t = 0. Cells form
irreversible bonds to patches. By forming a bond to a maximum of two patches, they mediate bonds
between monomers. When a cell attempts to hop to a lattice space occupied by an aggregate or vice
versa, the cell forms a bond to the aggregate with a probability pCA (see Fig. 3.1 a)),

pCA =
F

F + O
, (3.1)

where F and O are the number of free and occupied patches of the aggregate, respectively. pCA is the
the fraction of patches in the aggregate that are free.

When an aggregate attempts to hop to a space already occupied by another aggregate, they form a cell-
mediated bond with probability pAA (see Fig. 3.1 b)),

pAA =
F1O2 + O1F2

(F1 + O1)(F2 + O2)
, (3.2)

where F1,2 and O1,2 are the number of free and occupied patches and the subscript identifies the corre-
sponding aggregate. pAA is the fraction of pairs of patches, one from each aggregate, where one is free
and the other is occupied. pAA is zero when both aggregates only have free patches or only have occu-
pied patches. Despite aggregates occupying one lattice space, aggregate characteristics such as size and
number of occupied patches are taken into account through the probabilities pCA and pAA. If no bond is
formed, the collision is elastic and the cell or aggregate that is moving returns to its initial position. No
cell-mediated bonds may be formed between monomers belonging to the same aggregate.

The number of free patches F , occupied patches O, and size S of an aggregate are not independent.
When two free monomers form a bond, the resulting dimer is such that F = F1 + F2 ? 1 and O =
O1 + O2 ? 1 = f ?F1 + f ?F2 ? 1. Generalizing for an aggregate composed of S monomers:

F = F1 + F2 ? 1 + F3 ? 1 + ... =
S?
i=1

Fi ? (S ? 1),

O = f ?F1 + f ?F2 ? 1 + f ?F3 ? 1 + ... = Sf ?
S?
i=1

Fi ? (S ? 1),

(3.3)

(3.4)

and thus,

F + O = S(f ? 2) + 2. (3.5)

We measured the average size of the aggregates ?S?(t) as a function of time defined as

?S? =
N

Nagg
, (3.6)

where N is the number of free monomers at t = 0 and Nagg(t) is the number of aggregates as a function
of time. As all monomers are free at t = 0, Nagg(0) = N. We have also measured the size Smax(t) of
the largest aggregate as a function of time, and the bond probability pb(t), defined as the probability that
a patch forms a cell-mediated bond with a second patch as a function of time. Aggregates are tree-like
and the number of bonds between the monomers composing an aggregate of size S is S?1; as for every

22



bond, there are two patches,

pb =
2

fN

Nagg?
a=1

(Sa ? 1) =
2(N ?Nagg)

fN
, (3.7)

where a indexes the aggregates and Sa is the size of the a-th aggregate. All monomers and cells start
free. Let C be the number of cells at t = 0. We define ? as the ratio of cells to patches,

? =
C

Nf
. (3.8)

An aggregate of size S will diffuse with the coefficient DSm. Since time can be rescaled, the dynamics
does not depend on the absolute value of the diffusion coefficients, but on their relative value. We define
? as the ratio of cell and free monomer diffusion coefficients:

? =
Dc
D1m

. (3.9)

Henceforth, we will rescale time such that D1m = 1.

In section 3.1, we outline the algorithm used in the simulations; in section 3.2, we study the limit of
all aggregates having the same diffusion coefficient; in section 3.3, we study the limit where only free
monomers diffuse.

3.1 Computational methods

Simulations were performed on a 3D cubic lattice of linear length Lbox with a Monte Carlo algorithm
inspired on the kinetic Monte Carlo method [24, 25], but with rejection sampling, as described below. As
we study the limit nm ? 1 , the discretization of the lattice does not significantly influence the results.
Periodic boundary conditions were used. Cells hop with rate qc and aggregates of size S hop with rate
qSm. We keep track of the number of cells Nc and of aggregates of size S N

S
m. We consider hopping to be

uncorrelated in space and time and so the total rate at which cells hop is Ncqc, and the total rate at which
aggregates of size S hop is NSmq

S
m. The total rate of hopping Q is then the sum over cells and aggregates

of all sizes present in the simulation,

Q = Ncqc + N
1
mq

1
m + N

2
mq

2
m + ... + N

Smax
m q

Smax
m . (3.10)

A random uniform variable ? ? ]0, 1] is generated and used to pick if a cell or a particle attempts to hop.
The probability that a cell attempts to hop is Ncqc/Q; the probability that an aggregate of size S attempts
to hop is NSmq

S
m/Q. A second random uniform variable is generated to pick the specific aggregate or

cell that hops. A third random uniform variable picks a direction in which the hop is attempted. The
simulation clock is incremented whether the hop attempt is successful or not. As hopping is uncorrelated
in time, the time between hops ?t is a random variable described by an exponential distribution and is
generated by

?t = ?
log(?)

Q
, (3.11)

where ? is a uniformly generated random variable. This method of incrementing the simulation clock
preserves the correct time evolution, provided that we use the physical rates for each process.

23



To obtain the rates qc and qSm, we discretize the diffusion equation [17]. For simplicity, we take the 1D
case for a single monomer:

?m

?t
= D1m

?2m

?x2
, (3.12)

where m(x,t) is the probability of finding the monomer in position x at time t, and D1m is the diffusion
coefficient of free monomers. Discretizing the partial derivatives in x, we obtain

?m

?t
= D1m

m(x + ?x) + m(x? ?x) ? 2m(x)
?x2

, (3.13)

where ?x is the lattice constant. An initial condition such that m(x± ?x) = 0 makes it clear that the
hopping rate q1m is 2D

m/?x

2. For 3D, we obtain

qSm = 6
DSm
?x2

. (3.14)

In the simulations, we set ?x =
?

6 and rescaled time such that q1m = D
1
m = 1. All simulations were

for f = 6.

To quantify the statistical error of a measurement, the standard error ?s(A) of measured quantity A was
calculated,

?s(A) =
?(A)?
Nsamples

, (3.15)

where ?(A) is the approximated standard deviation of A calculated from the measurements, and Nsamples
is the number of measurements.

3.2 Constant aggregate diffusion coefficient

We study the limit where all aggregates diffuse with the same coefficient,

DSm = D
1
m = 1. (3.16)

In eqs. (2.2a)–(2.2d), k is the ratio between the rate of cells forming a second bond and the rate of cells
forming a first bond. When k ? 0, all cells form one bond before any cell can form two. If ? ? 0,
the density of occupied patches after all cells form one bond will be much lower than the density of free
patches. Conversely, if ? ? 1, the density of free patches after all cells form one bond will be much
lower than the density of occupied patches. As both occupied and free patches are required to form a
bond, and because low densities decrease the effect of spatial correlations, the mean-field rate equations
fit the simulations better for ? ? {0, 1}. Figure 3.2 shows spatial correlations between aggregates have
a significant effect on the dynamics, as the number of cells with zero, one and two bonds (C0, C1, C2,
respectively) obtained from eqs. (2.2a)–(2.2d) and from the simulations deviate significantly outside of
the limits ? ?{0, 1}. Note that C0 in the lattice model corresponds to the number of free cells, C1 to the
sum of all occupied patches, and C2 can be inferred from the number of aggregates Nagg as in eq. (3.7).

Figure 3.3 shows that ?S?, Smax, and pb are non-monotonic as a function of ? and exhibit a constant
value for ? ? [1/6, 5/6] in the asymptotic limit. To understand these results, we start by assuming an
interval of ? exists for which all cells form cell-mediated bonds and calculate the asymptotic value of

In eq. (3.18), ?S? diverges at ? = 1/f, which corresponds to one cell per monomer; in this case, all
monomers will eventually belong to the same aggregate (see Fig. 3.4 b)) and ?S? = Smax = N. A
larger value of ? does not result in more cell-mediated bonds because aggregates are tree-like and there
cannot be more bonds than N ? 1. If there is more than f ? 1 cells per monomer, not all monomers can
form cell-mediated bonds due to lack of empty patches. There arises a competition between cells with
one bond and free cells for the last empty patches. ?S? is thus determined by ?. In the limit of cells
diffusing must faster than aggregates (? ? ?), dynamics are split in two regimes. The first is the cell
regime, in which only cells diffuse. All cells form one bond in the cell regime for ? ? 1. When ? ??
and ? = 1, all patches are occupied at the end of the cell regime, thus a larger number of cells such that
? &gt; 1 does not influence the aggregation. The interesting range when ? ?? is ? ? [0, 1]. Afterwards
comes the aggregate regime, in which only aggregates diffuse. For ? &gt; (f ? 1)/f, all free patches form

and filled orange circles represent occupied patches. a) When there is less than one cell per monomer, dynamics cease due to
a lack of cells; b) when there is between one and f ? 1 cell per monomer, dynamics cease due to all monomers forming one
aggregate; c) when there is more than f ? 1 cells per monomer, dynamics cease due to a lack of free patches.

Figure 3.3 shows ?S?, Smax, and pb are maximized for ? = 0.5 for finite times. This is expected as it
corresponds to an equal number of occupied and free patches. However, pb takes values comparable with
the asymptotic state much faster than ?S?. From eqs. (3.6) and (3.7), we obtain

At initial times, when ?S? ? 1, the ratio of the relative variation in pb is much larger than the relative

one is interested in the time evolution of large tree-like aggregates.

When ? is finite and the timescales of aggregate and cell diffusion are not separable, cell-mediated

bonds can occur between aggregates before all cells form a bond. For ?&amp;lt;

, the asymptotic value

of ?S?/N, Smax/N and pb does not depend on ?. It does not matter if all cells form a bond before

predicted to be the lower bound of the interval of ? in which the asymptotic values of ?S?, Smax and pb depend on ?.

?. The faster aggregates diffuse when compared to cells, the likelier it is to find other aggregates and
form a cell-mediated bond before free cells can form bonds to the remaining empty patches; thus a lower
value of ? results in increased ?S?/N, Smax/N, and pb.
Figure 3.5 shows ?S?/N, Smax/N, and pb at t = 3 × 105 for three values of ? for which the timescales
of cell and aggregate diffusion are not separable, as well as the limits ? ? 1 and ? ? 1. It was found
that increasing ? above 105 or decreasing ? below 10?5 did not change the three measurements at the
simulated density of nm = 0.1. Unphysical effects regarding the discretization of the lattice arise at
higher values of nm. Because the lattice model of this chapter is most valid in the limit nm ? 0, a study
of the influence of nm is not provided in this chapter. Chapter 4 goes into greater detail on the effects of
nm and of finite-size effects.

To obtain a more complete picture of the dynamics, we introduce the weighted size distribution d(S,t),
defined as the fraction of monomers which are part of aggregates of size S at time t. Note that d(S = 1, t)
is the number of free monomers and

??
S=1

d(S,t) = 1. (3.26)

d(S,t) is related to the standard size distribution s(S,t), defined as the fraction of aggregates which have
size S at time t through

aggregate of size S at time t, describing the importance of each size to the dynamics more directly than

3.3 Diffusion of only free monomers

In this section, we study the limit where diffusion of aggregates with size larger than one can be neglected
in the timescale of free monomer diffusion. For simplicity, hereafter we will refer to these aggregates as
simply “aggregates”. There are thus three timescales in the limit ? ? ?, and the dynamics separate
into three regimes. First is the cell regime, in the diffusion of cells dominates. All cells form one bond in
the cell regime. Afterwards is the monomer regime in which the diffusion of free monomers dominates.
Finally there is the aggregate regime where the diffusion of aggregates dominates. We study only the

Figure 3.7 shows that ?S? is initially maximized at ? = 0.5 as seen in section 3.2, however the asymptotic
state is fundamentally different from the ones seen before, as all three quantities exhibit a bimodal shape
with local maxima in ? = {0.12, 0.88}± 0.01 and ? = 0.5 ± 0.1 corresponding to a local minimum.

Let us consider the distribution of occupied patches per monomer dO(n), defined as the probability that
a monomer has n occupied patches immediately after the cell regime. Immediately after the cell regime,
all monomers are free. To obtain dO(n), we solve a set of mean-field rate equations for the cell regime as
in chapter 2. Assuming that the rate of cells forming a bond with a monomer per unit time is proportional
to its number of free patches,

If there is much less than one linker per monomer, monomers with only free patches dominate; if there
is between one and f ? 1 cells per monomer, monomers with both free and occupied patches dominate;
if there is much more than f ? 1 linkers per monomer, monomers with only occupied patches dominate.
Since it requires one free and one occupied patch to form a bond, free monomers with both occupied and
free patches can form bonds with any other free monomer. By contrast, free monomers with only occu-
pied patches cannot form bonds among each other, likewise for free monomers with only free patches.
As aggregates are immobile, they may only grow through linker-mediated bonds with free monomers. If
there is much less than one cell per monomer, all cells form a second bond but they are not numerous

enough for all monomers to form cell-mediated bonds in the asymptotic limit. Larger values of ? result
in a larger number of cells and ?S?. Figure 3.9 a) shows that the values of ? = {0.12, 0.88}± 0.01

dimers.

corresponding to the maxima coincide with the edges of the interval of ? in which all monomers form
cell-mediated bonds in the asymptotic limit (number of free monomers Nmon = 0). In this limit and
interval, ?S? is determined by the number of aggregates. Monomers with only free or occupied patches
cannot form cell-mediated bonds with each other. A distribution dO(n) with less of these monomers in-
creases the number of aggregates (mostly as dimers) and decreases ?S?. Figure 3.9 a) shows the number
of aggregates is maximized at ? = 0.5, which corresponds to the value of ? that maximizes

?f?1
n=1 dO(n).

The values of ? which minimize the number of monomers with both free and occupied patches in the
interval in which Nmon = 0 thus correspond to the maxima in ?S?. The smaller of those values is
? = 0.12 ± 0.01. If there is much more than f ? 1 cells per monomer, the number of free patches after
the cell regime is not enough for all monomers to form cell-mediated bonds. Larger values of ? decrease
the number of free patches and ?S?. The mechanism behind the first maximum leads to a second maxi-
mum in ?S? at ? = 0.88 ± 0.01. When ? ?? and spatial correlations can be neglected, the dynamics
are symmetrical to swapping free and occupied patches and ?S? is symmetrical with respect to ? = 0.5.
We calculate the number of aggregates Nstat with a set of mean-field balance equations for the monomer
regime using the distribution dO as initial conditions. Following the same principles as in chapter 2,
we define Nstat(t) as the number of aggregates as a function of time, Nboth(t) as the number of free
monomers with both free and occupied patches, and Nonly(t) as the number of free monomers with only
free or occupied patches,

N?stat = q0 NbothNonly +

where N is the number of monomers at t = 0. In eqs. (3.35a)–(3.35c), we have neglected aggregates
with only free or occupied patches by performing the approximation that all free monomers can form
bonds to all aggregates. We neglected also the effect of the size of aggregates and of the number of free
and occupied patches of free monomers and aggregates on the aggregation rates by considering constant
rate constants q0 and q1. Free monomers form bonds with each other at a rate q0 and with aggregates at a
rate q1. Since aggregates are immobile, q1 = q0/2 [18]. The absolute value of q0 does not influence the
asymptotic result. We have also neglected aggregation between monomers with only occupied patches
and only free patches. The shape of eq. (3.34) is such that aggregation between these two monomers is
much rarer than aggregation between them and monomers with both free and occupied patches for all
values of ?.

Figure 3.9 b) shows N/Nstat obtained from the asymptotic numerical solutions of eqs. (3.35a)–(3.35c).
For ? ? [0.12, 0.88], the asymptotic number of free monomers is zero and N/Nstat = ?S?. When
the asymptotic number of free monomers is different from zero, we may use eqs. (3.18) and (3.20) to
obtain ?S?. The values of ? which correspond to the maxima in ?S? can be obtained by the intersections
of ?S? obtained from eqs. (3.18) and (3.20) with N/Nstat obtained from eqs. (3.35a)–(3.35c). These
intersections coincide with the edges of the interval of ? in which Nmon = 0 and thus with the maxima
in ?S?. The maxima derived theoretically are in very good agreement with the ones obtained from the
simulations, as shown in Fig. 3.9 b), validating our proposed mechanism.

where N ?Nmon is the number of monomers that are part of aggregates. Figure 3.10 b) shows ?S?stat
exhibits a bimodal shape with its maxima in the same values of ? as ?S?. The mechanism is similar as for
?S?. When there is much less than one cell per monomer, monomers with zero or one occupied patches
dominate; only dimers can form and ?S?stat = 2. A larger number of cells enables the formation of larger
aggregates until there are enough cells for all monomers to form a cell-mediated bond; ?S?stat = ?S?
for ? ? [0.12, 0.88]. If there is much more than f ? 1 cells per monomer, monomers with f ? 1 and f
occupied patches dominate and only dimers can form.
Knowing that the total number of aggregates of all sizes Nagg = Nmon + Nstat, we rearrange equation
(3.6),

Nmon =
N

?S?
?Nstat. (3.38)

Nstat is obtained from eqs. (3.35a)–(3.35c). Meanwhile, when Nmon 6= 0 in the asymptotic limit, ?S? is
obtained from eqs. (3.18) and (3.20). We can therefore calculate Nmon using eq. (3.38) and ?S?stat (see
Fig. 3.9 a) and b)).
Equations (3.35a)–(3.35c) predict all monomers form bonds with aggregates for all values of ? (asymp-
totically Nboth,Nonly ? 0), which is seemingly incompatible with the results of Fig. 3.9 a)). To
understand why the calculated values of Nmon, Nstat, ?S?, and ?S?stat match the simulations despite
this difficulty, we show in Fig. 3.10 a) the time evolution of Nboth and Nonly for a value of ? in which
Nmon 6= 0. Because Nboth tends to zero earlier than Nonly and because Nonly cannot form aggregates
with itself, after some time Nstat remains approximately constant despite the value of Nonly. We then
calculate the correct value of Nmon using eqs. (3.18), (3.20), and (3.38).

Chapter 4

The role of the shape of aggregates

Figure 4.1: Illustration of the main ingredients of the lattice model: a) diffusion; b) rotation (free monomers only); c) formation
of bonds between cells and aggregates leading to a free patch becoming occupied; d) formation of cell-mediated bonds between
two aggregates.

In chapter 3, we studied the dynamics of a 3D system of monomers and cells through a lattice model
where every aggregate occupied one lattice space, neglecting aggregate shape and patch correlations. In
this chapter, we study a lattice model where these correlations are accounted for. For simplicity, the term
”aggregate” will include monomers. The size of an aggregate is defined as the number of monomers in
it; free monomers are aggregates of size one.
Monomers occupy a lattice space and move by a sequence of random hops to their nearest neighbors
(see Fig. 4.1 a)). The hopping rate is related to the translational diffusion coefficient Dm. A lattice space
cannot be occupied by more than one monomer. The density of monomers nm is defined as the ratio of
lattice spaces occupied by monomers at t = 0. Monomers have a number f of patches on their surface
given by the coordination number of the underlying lattice. f is the maximum number of bonds they can
form. A patch can be free and form no bond or it can be occupied and form an irreversible bond to a cell.
A patch cannot be occupied by more than one cell. Each patch points to one of the nearest neighbors of
the monomer, which undergoes rigid rotations with a rate related to the rotational diffusion coefficient

35



Dr (see Fig. 4.1 b)).
As in the previous chapters, there is a second species, the cells. Cells occupy a lattice space and hop
with a rate related to their diffusion coefficient Dc. A lattice space can be occupied by at most one cell.
The density of cells nc is defined as the ratio of lattice spaces occupied by cells at t = 0. Cells form
irreversible bonds to patches. By forming a bond to a maximum of two patches, they mediate bonds
between monomers. If a monomer and cell are adjacent and the patch of the monomer pointing towards
the cell is free, then it is possible for one to hop to the lattice space occupied by the other. If so, the patch
of the monomer which pointed towards the cell becomes occupied (see Fig. 4.1 c)).
When a monomer is adjacent to another monomer, the two form an irreversible cell-mediated bond if the
two patches that point to one another include one free and one occupied patch (see Fig. 4.1 d)). Cell-
mediated bonds between free monomers can occur after a hop or a rotation and results in a dimer. We
neglect the rotation of aggregates of size larger than one. An aggregate of size S hops with a rate related
to the diffusion coefficient DSm, such that all monomers that belong to it hop in the same direction. An
aggregate may not hop if it is not possible for a monomer that belongs to it to hop, i.e when the adjacent
lattice space is occupied by another monomer or occupied by a cell and the patch that points to it is
occupied.
Unlike in the model discussed in chapter 3, aggregates may not be tree-like. Let S be the size of an
aggregate, F and O be its number of free and occupied patches, respectively. Since for every cell-
mediated bond an occupied and a free patch are used,

O + F = Sf ? 2Nbonds, (4.1)

where Nbonds is the number of cell-mediated bonds formed between monomers belonging to the aggre-
gate. Nbonds can be split into two contributions,

Nbonds = S ? 1 + NL, (4.2)

where S ? 1 is the number of bonds in a tree-like aggregate and NL is the number of redundant bonds,
from which result loops. Combining eqs. (4.1) and (4.2), we obtain

O + F = S(f ? 2) + 2 ? 2NL, (4.3)

which is the general form of eq. (3.5) for any aggregate.
We measured the average size of the aggregates ?S?(t) as a function of time defined as

?S? =
N

Nagg
, (4.4)

where N is the number of free monomers at t = 0 and Nagg(t) is the number of aggregates as a function
of time. As all monomers are free at t = 0, Nagg(0) = N. We have also measured the size Smax(t) of
the largest aggregate as a function of time, and the bond probability pb, defined as the probability that a
patch forms a cell-mediated bond with a second patch as a function of time. To characterize the shape of
aggregates, we measure the fraction of all bonds which are redundant nL.
All monomers and cells start free. Let C be the number of cells at t = 0. We define ? as the ratio of cells
to patches,

? =
C

Nf
. (4.5)

36



An aggregate of size S will diffuse with the coefficient DSm. Since time can be rescaled, the dynamics
does not depend on the absolute value of the diffusion coefficients, but on their ratio. We define ? as the
ratio of cell and free monomer diffusion coefficients:

? =
Dc
D1m

. (4.6)

Henceforth, we will rescale time such that D1m = 1. We assume the timescale of monomer rotation is of
the same order of the timescale of monomer diffusion and set

Dr = D
1
m = 1. (4.7)

While the model is defined for a generic DSm, here only the limit where only free monomers diffuse was
studied (section 4.2).

4.1 Computational methods

In chapter 3, the algorithm used was rejection-based in the sense that it could attempt an event that is
not successful, e.g. a cell attempting to hop to a lattice space already occupied by a cell. While the
correct time evolution is obtained and its implementation is simpler, the rejection-based algorithm is
computationally inefficient. In the present chapter, simulations are performed with the rejection-free
kinetic Monte Carlo method [24, 25].
Cells hop with rate qc. We consider diffusion to be isotropic and so the rate of hopping in a certain
direction q?c is

q?c =
qc
z
, (4.8)

where z is the coordination number of the underlying lattice. Aggregates of size S hop with rate q?Sm . Free
monomers rotate along a certain axis with rate q?r. A list containing all possible events (i.e. all possible
hops and rotations) is updated at every time step. The next event is chosen from this list with a probability
proportional to its rate. Choosing from the list ensures no events are rejected and considerably reduces
the computational demands when compared to the rejection-based algorithm in chapter 3.
We consider events to be uncorrelated in space and time and so the total rate of events Q is the sum of the
rates of all events in the list. The time between hops ?t is a random variable described by an exponential
distribution and is generated by

?t = ?
log(?)

Q
, (4.9)

where ? ? ]0, 1] is a uniformly generated random variable. This method of incrementing the simulation
clock preserves the correct time evolution.
The rates q?c and q

?S
m are obtained with an argument similar to chapter 3. For any dimension, we obtain

q?c =
Dc

?x2
, (4.10)

q?Sm =
DSm
?x2

, (4.11)

where Dc and DSm are the diffusion coefficients of cells and aggregates of size S respectively, and ?x
is the lattice constant. Simulations were performed on a 3D cubic lattice of linear length Lbox using
periodic boundary conditions. To keep consistency with the simulations in chapter 3, we set ?x =

?
6

37



and rescale time such that q?
1

m = D
1
m/6 = 1/6. As we study the limit nm ? 1, the discretization of

the lattice does not significantly influence the results. It is assumed that the the timescale of rotation of
monomers is of the same order as the timescale of diffusion of monomers and so we set

q?r = q
?1
m. (4.12)

All simulations were for f = 6. A monomer is thus described by a three-dimensional position vector ~x
and a six-dimensional configuration vector ~o related to the occupancy of the patches. A simple way to
reduce the memory usage of the event list is mapping both vectors to integers. The position vector ~x

~x = {x1,x2,x3}, (4.13)

is mapped to an integer X (where x1,x2,x3 are integers),

X = x1 + x2Lbox + x3L
2
box. (4.14)

The reverse mapping is

x1 =
(
X%L2box

)
%Lbox, (4.15)

x2 =
(
X%L2box

)
//Lbox, (4.16)

x3 = X//L
2
box, (4.17)

where the functions a%b and a//b are the remainder of the division of a by b and the integer division of
a by b, respectively. This transformation is a one-to-one correspondence as 0 ? x1,x2,x3 &amp;lt;Lbox. The
configuration vector ~o is written explicitly as

~o = {o1,o2,o3,o4,o5,o6}, (4.18)

where the coordinates oi are Booleans with 1 indicating an occupied patch and 0 a free patch. The
variable i indexes the direction the patch is facing. In the same style as with ~x, ~o is transformed to an
integer O,

O =

4.2 Diffusion of only free monomers

In section 3.3, we studied the limit where diffusion of aggregates of size larger than one can be neglected
in the timescale of free monomer diffusion. We therefore referred to aggregates of size larger than one
as “aggregates” and

DSm = ?S,1, (4.21)

where ?i,j is the Kroenecker delta.

A snapshot of a simulation can be found in Fig. 4.3. When cells are much faster than monomers
(? ? ?), the dynamics separate into two regimes. First is the cell regime, in which only cells diffuse.
All cells form one bond in the cell regime. Afterwards is the monomer regime where only free monomers

diffuse.
We measured the average size of aggregates and monomers ?S? and the average size of aggregates ?S?stat
defined as

?S?stat =
N ?Nmon
Nstat

, (4.22)

where Nmon is the number of free monomers. It was found that both the asymptotic values of ?S?
and ?S?stat exhibited bimodal shapes when mapped as function of ?. These bimodal shapes arose in
the point-like model of chapter 3 due to the form of the distribution of occupied patches after the cell
regime. A mean-field theory was developed which captured the physics. Figure 4.3 shows the bimodal
shape is present in the model introduced in this chapter. Figure 4.4 b) shows that the bimodal shape is
not a finite-size effect, but caused by the mechanism discussed in chapter 3.

3. Simulations were averaged over
{1000, 500, 250, 100} samples for Lbox = {16, 25, 32, 64}, respectively.

To quantify the inter-connectivity of the aggregates, we measure the fraction of bonds which are redun-
dant nL. In Fig. 4.4 a), it can be seen that nL &amp;lt;1% for all values of ?. Because the average size of the
aggregates is at most ? 3.25, it is noteworthy to mention that only aggregates of size larger than three
may exhibit loops in a cubic lattice, which partially explains the low values of nL. Also relevant is the
fact that redundant bonds occur when a free monomer forms more than one bond to an aggregate in the
same time step, which is a much rarer event that the formation of a single bond. Larger values of ?S?stat
increase the probability that a free monomer is adjacent to two or more monomers belonging to the same
aggregate. Despite ?S?stat being maximized for ? = {0.12, 0.88}±0.01, no maxima are present in nL at
those values of ?. The variation in ?S?stat is too small to play a decisive role in nL. The formation of two
or more bonds requires more than just adjacency of multiple monomers, it also requires that the patches
between monomers form free/occupied pairs. If we discard the effect of ?S?stat, the probability of a free

40



monomer forming a second cell-mediated bond after forming a first link is maximized for ? = 0.5, in
which the total number of free and occupied patches is equal.

?max1 = 0.12 and triangles to ?max2 = 0.88. Dashed line separates the region of parameters in which cells diffuse faster than
monomers (left) from the region in which monomers diffuse faster than cells (right). Simulations were performed on a system
of lateral size Lbox = 25, monomer density of nm = 0.01, and averaged over 500 samples.

Until now, we have considered the case of cell diffusion much faster than monomer diffusion ? ? 1.
For a finite ?, the timescale of cell diffusion is no longer separable from that of monomer diffusion,

41



meaning cells can form a second bond before all cells form a first bond. While the values of ?max1,
?min and ?max2 do not change with ?, ?S? does. In the asymptotic limit and ? ? 0, it was found that
there is an initial regime in which larger values of ? increase ?S?, evolving to a plateau in which ?S?
is constant with ? (up to the largest measured value of ? = 1.0). In particular, the maxima disappear.
Figure 4.5 displays the effect of ? in the maxima and minimum of ?S?. The order of magnitude of the
value of ? at which the maximum for ?max1 disappears differs from that of ?max2.

As shown in chapter 3, the maxima are due to low rates of formation of bonds between monomers
with only free or occupied patches, which lowers the number of dimers when compared to ?min. The
disappearing of the maxima is thus associated with an increased number of dimers, as seen in Fig. 4.5
b). Because some but not all cells form bonds to patches, a system with finite ? behaves like a system
with ? ?? but with an effective value of ? that is lower, provided there are more than enough cells for
all monomers to form cell-mediated bonds. For ?max2, this lower effective ? causes more monomers to
have both free and occupied patches which increases the number of dimers, resulting in lower ?S? when
? . 102. For ?min, the effective reduction in ? does not change ?S? much as the number of monomers
with both free and occupied patches does not change much.

The mechanism that increases the number of dimers for ?max1 is different than for ?max2 because there
are barely enough cells for all monomers to form cell-mediated bonds and the equivalence with the case
? ? ? and lower effective ? is not valid. While monomers do not have enough occupied patches for
all of them to form cell-mediated bonds when their diffusion starts to be relevant around ? ? 102, there
are still enough cells in total and we must simply wait longer times to retain the maximum.Therefore,
the mechanism for the increase in the number of dimers in ?max1 is different and visible only when
? . 1. When ? ? 0, the relevant timescale is given by the diffusion of monomers. For ? . 1, cells
are mainly static, and monomers are responsible for dimer formation (through formation of bonds with
static linkers) as seen in Fig. 4.5 b). The longer timescale of linker diffusion results on a later arrival to
the empty patches of already static aggregates (dimers), minimizing further aggregation.

To finish this section, we verify that varying monomer density nm does not suppress the bimodal shape
of ?S? when nm ? 1 and ? ??. Figure 4.6 shows the asymptotic height of the maxima and minimum
of ?S? as function of nm and the inset shows their corresponding value of ?. It was found that, when
nm ? 1, the height of the maxima and minimum scale linearly with nm,

?S?? nm , nm ? 1. (4.23)

Extrapolating to find the height of the maxima in the limit nm ? 0, it is found that they are equal. In
this limit, spatial correlations are non-existent and ?S? is symmetrical, as predicted by the analysis of
chapter 3. Spatial correlations play a larger role in systems with larger value of nm, e.g. two aggregates
merging due to a monomer forming a bridge between them. In these systems, the curve ?S?(?) has an
asymmetry.

The linear fits for ?S?(?min) and ?S?(?max1) intersect for nm ? 0.48. For nm &gt; 0.48, the bimodal
shape of ?S? is not present. This conclusion is consistent with the results seen in the inset of Fig. 4.6,
as the value of ?min approaches the value of ?max1, which remains constant with nm. Simulations were
performed for nm = 0.55 and no maximum was found in the range ? ? [0.11, 0.13].
At values of nm large enough such that nm + nc is comparable to 1, the dynamics are effected by the
discretization, e.g. cubic vs. hexagonal lattice. Such dependency on the underlying lattice is unphysical
as the on-lattice models of this chapter and of chapter 3 are simplifications of a continuous system.
The limit in which the results of our on-lattice models are most realistic is the limit nm ? 0, where

the average distance between aggregates is much larger than the average distance between monomers
belonging to the same aggregate; a more detailed study of the dependency on nm and the associated
discretization effects will not be presented.

Conclusion

The central problem studied here is the aggregation process of self-assembled scaffolds composed of
chitosan particles linked together by cells, which we modeled with patchy particles. We started with
a simplified analysis, increasing the complexity stepwise: in chapter 1, we developed mean-field rate
equations, while correlations between aggregates and patches were introduced in chapters 3 and 4, re-
spectively. This gradual addition of features allowed isolated studies, resulting in a deeper understanding
of how aggregation depends on each model (e.g. diffusion and concentration of species).
Cells adhere to one another to form tissues. In chapter 2, we compared two models for scaffold self-
assembly focused on the dynamics of the cells, a first in which cells can form bonds to one another
and a second where they cannot. It was found that suppressing this natural behavior resulted in larger,
more interconnected scaffolds that grew faster, which is of great practical interest. A large, mechanically
resilient scaffold is required for the growth of healthy, macroscopic tissue. Furthermore, the quicker the
scaffold assembles, the less likely it is for the assembly process to be effected by the natural bioactivity
of the surrounding environment. Decreasing the formation time also increases the quality of life of the
treated patients and decreases medical expenses. For the remainder of the work, we focused on the model
with suppressed cell-cell bonds, for which we obtained multiple analytical and numerical results, such
as the distribution of cells and the probability that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond to another patch.
An application of mean-field percolation theory bridges the gap between cell dynamics and scaffold
structure, predicting the formation of a gel. It was found that there is a value of the ratio of cells to
particles that optimizes scaffold growth.
In chapter 3, we introduced spatial correlations between aggregates through a lattice model, which we
solved numerically through a Monte Carlo algorithm. The lattice model considered aggregates to be
point-like and tree-like. We first studied the limit in which the diffusion coefficient of aggregates was
independent of their size. An interval of the ratio of cells to particles was found such that a giant aggregate
that includes all particles forms, in agreement with some simple calculations. We have also obtained the
functional form of the size distribution of aggregates for some intervals of the ratio of cells to particles.
We then studied the limit in which there is a separation of timescales between the diffusion of free
monomers and the diffusion of aggregates of size two or more. It was found that the average size of
aggregates exhibits a bimodal shape as a function of the ratio of cells to particles with two optimal values
in the asymptotic limit for a high value of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients of cells and particles.
This shape is preceded by a regime in which there is only one optimal value. The proposed mechanism
involving the suppression of bonds between a portion of the monomers controlled by the occupied patch
distribution was verified with an analytical treatment and simulations.
Finally, in chapter 4, we introduced aggregate shape and patch correlations in the limit where the
timescale of the diffusion of free monomers is separate from the diffusion of aggregates of size two
or more. Simulations were performed with the more efficient kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. In the limit
where the diffusion of cells is much faster than the diffusion of free monomers, a bimodal shape was

45



found for the average size of aggregates, similarly to chapter 3, allowing us to conclude aggregate shape
is not a key feature of the mechanism. It was found there is an optimum value of the ratio of cells to
particles for the fraction of loops which coincides with the value which maximizes scaffold growth, ex-
plained through the distribution of occupied patches. It was further found that the maxima in the average
size of aggregates is not relevant for the fraction of loops. The possibility of indirectly tuning the fraction
of loops through the ratio of cells to particles allows the tuning of the porosity and mechanical rigidity
of the scaffold, for which there are strict requirements.
We studied the effect of the ratio of cell and monomer diffusion coefficients, having found that the
maxima in the average size of aggregates disappear when monomers are much faster than cells. The two
maxima disappear at different diffusion timescales due to two different mechanisms; one involving an
effective reduction in the ratio of cells to particles and one involving a reduced rate of formation of bonds
between cells and dimers. Both mechanisms result in an increased number of dimers in the asymptotic
limit. We concluded with a study of the density of monomers, where we show that both the values of
the ratio of cells to particles corresponding to the maxima and their height depend on the density of
monomers. We obtain a linear dependency of the height of the maxima valid for low densities, which is
the limit where the lattice model is most realistic.
Even though the motivation for this study is in scaffold formation, these results are relevant for any
system that exhibits aggregation mediated by a second species and it is of interest to practitioners to
understand how experimental conditions and timescales can affect targeted structures. Extensions of
the work developed can include a study of the lattice model of chapter 4 for a generic relation between
aggregate size and diffusion coefficient. The diffusivity of clusters has been studied extensively both for
liquids [26] and for adsorption on surfaces [27]. Furthermore, it is of interest to compare the results of
cell-mediated aggregation with the work of P. Meakin, which contains numerous results involving the
size distribution in the simple one-species aggregation model [28]. Of high interest to the motivation is
the measurement of the porosity and mechanical strength of the self-assembled structures. Working in
tandem with Molecular Dynamics studies, more realistic rates for bond breaking can be introduced such
as to model the self-assembly of scaffolds in e.g. sheared fluids.
