ABSTRACT

An investigation of the tectonic controls of the fluvial morphology and sedimentary processes of an area located

southwest of Manaus in the Amazon Basin was conducted using orbital remote sensing data. In this region, low topo-

graphicgradientsrepresentamajorobstacleformorphotectonicanalysisusingconventionalmethods. Theuseofremote

sensing data can contribute significantly to overcome this limitation. In this instance, remote sensing data comprised

digital elevation model (DEM) acquired by the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Landsat Thematic

Mapper images. Advanced image processing techniques were employed for enhancing the topographic textures and

providing a three-dimensional visualization, hence allowing interpretation of the morphotectonic elements. This led

to the recognition of main tectonic compartments and several morphostructural features and landforms related to the

neotectonic evolutionof this portionof theAmazonBasin. Features suchas fault scarps, anomalousdrainagepatterns,

aligned ridges, spurs andvalleys, are expressed in theenhanced imagesas conspicuous lineaments alongNE-SW,NW-

SE,E-WandN-Sdirections. Thesefeaturesareassociated to thegeometryofalternatedhorstandgrabenstructures, the

artificial shadowing in different directions and color en-

hancements allows interpreting the terrain features.

In the Amazon region, morphotectonic analysis is

not a simple task due mainly to the lack of altimetric

data at adequate scales. Most of this region has only

cartographic maps in the scale of 1:250,000, without or

only with a few topographic data, mainly due to low to-

pographic gradients. This data constraint occurs mostly

along the Amazon River channel, where there are only

pointaltimetricvalues. Moredetailedcartographyislim-

ited to some charts in the scale of 1:100,000, restricted

to the region surrounding the city of Manaus and some

neighboring areas. Furthermore, existing topographi-

cal surveys were carried out in the 1970s and 1980s,

based on small-scale aerial photographs, with altimetric

data being estimated on the basis of the height of tree

canopies, which sometimes does not express the actual

ground heights.

A new remote sensing technology based on radar

interferometry (InSAR) is making it possible to acquire

high quality altimetric data (Madsen and Zebker 1998).

Using this technology, NASA launched the Shuttle Ra-
dar Topography Mission (SRTM) in 2000, which al-
lowed the acquisition of altimetric data and the gen-

eration of DEMs of nearly 80% of the Earth’s surface

(Rabus et al. 2003). Thesedatawereused in thepresent

study in order to overcome the scarcity of information

on the topographyof thestudy regionand toenablemor-

photectonic analysis.

In spite of the limitations inherent to the region’s

thick vegetation coverage, and the available SRTM data

with moderate spatial resolution (90 m), DEMs enabled

three-dimensionalvisualizationoftheregion’slandscape

and contributed significantly to the analysis of the main

geomorphologic features. The topographic data con-

tained in these DEMs are more precise than those con-

tained in theprevious topographicchartsof thearea, and

permit the extraction of information for the elaboration

of several types of thematic maps. Furthermore, the use

of three-dimensional (3-D) digital visualization tools, in

conjunction with the SRTM data, allows for the recog-

nition of important and previously unknown morpho-

structural.

A 3-D model has been generated for the region

southwestofManausalong theSolimõesRiver, between

the towns of Iranduba and Manacapuru, encompassing

about 23,850 km2 (Fig. 1), for the purpose of morpho-

tectonic analysis. The area comprises an important seg-

ment of the Amazon Basin affected by Cenozoic tec-

tonics and has the availability of topographic maps at

1:100,000scaletocompareresultsfromdifferentapplied

methods. Analyses of the drainage network, landscape

features and geological information were spatially in-

tegrated to support the morphostructural interpretation,

the field checking of structural features and the spatial

analysisof theCenozoiccover. Important structural fea-

tures, such as tectonically uplifted and lowered areas,

fault scarps, aligned ridges and spurs, and anomalous

patterns in thedrainage,weredetermined. Such features

were used to interpret the morphotectonic framework of

the study area and to compare it to the regional neotec-

tonic model proposed by Hasui (1990) and Costa and

Hasui (1997).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The materials used for the morphotectonic analysis in-

clude: a) topographic maps of Manaus and Manaca-

puru at 1:100,000 scale (Manacapuru SA.20-Z-D-II and

Manaus SA.20-Z-D-III); b) geological map of Brazil at

1:2,500,000 in digital format, prepared by the Geolog-

ical Survey of Brazil – CPRM (Bizzi et al. 2001); c)

LandsatEnhancedThematicMapper(ETM+)multispec-

tral image (path 231/row 62, acquired on 07.10.2001);

and d) digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar

Topographic Mission (NASA).

Drainage elements and topographic contours of the

available topographic maps were manually drawn using

a digitizing table and vector-data capture software, for

qualitative comparison with SRTM data. Data obtained

fromthegeologicalmapofBrazilweresuperimposedon

theDEMwith theuseofgeographic information system

(GIS) software for integrated analysis.

The Landsat ETM+ image was submitted to geo-

metrical correction based on known ground control

points (GCPs). The assessment of positional errors was

carried out through root mean square (RMS) analysis,

whichresultedinamaximumerrorof50meters,compat-

ible with the working scale. The geometrical correction

of the image was performed with a warping technique.

The final image was converted into UTM projection,

zone 20. Lineament extraction and landscape/drainage

interpretation were made from the geometrically cor-

rected image, using a RGB (red, green and blue) color

composition of bands 3, 4 and 5, and also individual

bands 5 and 7.

SRTM data were obtained through NASA´s web-

site (http://www.jpl. nasa.gov/srtm/index.html). SRTM

used twodifferent radar systems: CbandandXband. In

the present study the C band data were used.

The original spatial resolution of SRTM data is 1

arcsecond, equivalent to 30 m on the ground. However,

for strategic reasons (the mission was funded by the

National Imagery and Mapping Agency, North-Amer-

ican military cartographical agency), SRTM data made

available to the public for areas outside North Amer-

ica have a moderate spatial resolution of 3 arcseconds,

equivalent to about 90 m. Even so, the quality of data is

sufficient to generate 3-D models compatible to scales

around 1:100,000, with horizontal and vertical accura-

cies of about 50 m and 12 m, respectively. This repre-

sentsasignificantadvanceforareaswith limitedaltimet-

ric data, such as the Amazon.

There are some limitations of InSAR technology

for topographic surveysof vegetation-covered areas that

must be taken into consideration. The main limitation

is the ability of radar waves to penetrate into vegetation.

For C band, radar penetration is only partial when the

vegetation is dense. It must, therefore, be expected that

the DEMs used in this work may not represent with fi-

delity the true ground surface topography of the study

area, yet theymaycontain topographic valueswhich are

intermediatebetween theplant canopy’s topographyand

that of the ground.

DEM processing included converting its carto-

graphicprojection, performingcontrast enhancementby

histogram adjustments and applying synthetic shading

and 3-D visualization techniques. The altimetric con-

tour lines were extracted from the DEM and compared

with the available topographic maps. For the integra-

tion of the Landsat ETM+ image with the SRTM DEM,

theRGB+Intensitydisplay techniquewasused, inwhich

the DEM is allocated to the intensity channel whereas

three spectral bands of the Landsat ETM+ image are al-

located to the red, green and blue channels of the vi-

sualization display. In this way, the topography, given

by the DEM image, modulates the pixel color intensity

of each of the Landsat ETM+ bands used in the RGB

color composite, producing an image in which the in-

formation from the DEM and the Landsat bands is fully

merged.

The geomorphologic analysis comprised the iden-

tification and characterization of landscape elements in-

dicative of modern tectonic deformations, such as linear

features, fault scarps, formation of asymmetric terraces,

low (modern deposition sites) and high (sites prone to

erosion) blocks. Maps of lineaments and relief forms

were generated to provide support for the interpretation.

Theprinciplesof the relief analysisused in this studyare

based on Cooke (1990), Summerfield (1993), Stewart

andHancock(1994)andKellerandPinter (1996). Anal-

ysis of the drainage network was based on recognition

of drainage patterns associated with structural elements

(weaving, parallel, rectangular, in chandelier patterns,

amongothers), channelanomalies (anomalousmeander-

ing, rectilinear channels, etc.), formation of lakes and

riverswithdrownedvalleysanddrainage lineaments, as-

sociated to the Cenozoic tectonics. The drainage map

was used for the interpretation of these features and for

theextractionofdrainage lineaments. Drainageanalysis

was based on Howard (1967), Ouchi (1985), Schumm

(1986), Deffontaines (1989), Summerfield (1993) and

Stewart and Hancock (1994), among others.

Themapsobtained fromtheanalysisof lineaments,

relief forms and drainage network were integrated with

SRTM DEM and Landsat ETM+ images used as a basis

for field checking of the main interpreted features. The

final results were integrated as a morphotectonic map,

showing the tectonic compartments of the study region.

DATA ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING

In order to evaluate the precision of SRTM topographic

data, a comparison was made with elevation contours

obtained from the topographic maps Manaus SA.20-Z-

D-III and Manacapuru SA.20-Z-D-II (Fig. 2). Most of

the topographic contours on the existing maps corre-

spond to the 50 m level, being restricted to limited areas

reaching up to 100 m in altitude (Fig. 2A). To the south

of theSolimõesRiver, thereareonlya fewareasexhibit-

ing50mcontour lines, since the level of theAmazonian

plain is generally lower than 30 m.

It is possible to generate topographic contour lines

using SRTM data at any intervals, bearing in mind that

thesedatahaveatheoreticalerrorofabout12minheight.

However, a large number of contour lines would hinder

the comparative analysis. Therefore, contour lines were

generated at levels 35, 50and70m(Fig. 2B),which are

representative of the relief of the region and are within

the theoretical error of the data. The 100 m level was

excluded, since its occurrence is rare anddoesnot repre-

sent any broad or significant surface. The generation of

the contour lines relative to these levels was performed

through automatic extraction and tracing using digital

image processing software.

The comparison between map and SRTM eleva-

tions was done qualitatively, and the results showed that

they were quite similar. Furthermore, the 30 m contour

closely follows point values with this height shown on

themaps. Therefore, theSRTMdatawere considered to

be satisfactory and appropriate for performing the mor-

phostructural analysis in the study region.

A synthetic directional shading filter was applied

to the SRTM model represented in pseudo-color, for

the purpose of enhancing the topography and landscape

features(Fig.3A).Theazimuthandelevationvaluesused

in this synthetic shadingmaybevaried interactively, en-

abling the selection of optimal combinations of azimuth

and elevation values to enhance the desired morpholog-

ical features. The best combination was found to be an

azimuth of 62? and elevation of 53?, as shown in Fig-
ure 3B. This filtered image was used as the basis for the

interpretation of the relief compartments and, from this

interpretation, to infer the main brittle structures (frac-

tures and faults) present.

GEOLOGIC AND TECTONIC CONTEXT

The study area is located along the Solimões-Amazon

River system (Fig. 4), in the Amazon Palaeozoic Basin,

where the following lithostratigraphic units crop out:

tionisconstitutedbykaolin-rich,finetomedium-grained

red sandstone, locally displaying cross stratification

(Caputo et al. 1971). It crops out in the northern part of

the studyarea, at elevationsbetween50and100m,near

Manaus, Iranduba and Manacapuru. This formation has

been deposited by a high-energy fluvial system, in hu-

mid climate, when the paleo-Amazon River (known as

Sanozama) flew from East to West (Caputo et al. 1971).

Dino et al. (1999), based on studies carried out in the

region of Fazendinha and Nova Olinda, proposed a sub-

divisionof this unit into a lowerSequence1 (lateAptian

trine prograding system.

According to the geologic map of Brazil (Bizzi et

al. 2001), the areas located to the west of Manacapuru

and to the south of the Solimões River are characterized

by outcrops of the Içá Formation. This unit is uncon-

formable with the Alter do Chão Formation and com-

prises interlayeredsandyandmuddydeposits, formed in

an alluvial system. The occurrence of the Içá Forma-

tion in this region is controverse (controversial?), with

many authors considering only the Solimões Formation

(Costa et al. 1978, Lourenço et al. 1978). Rossetti et

al. (2005) consider that the Içá Formation has a Plio-

Pleistocene age, based on the fact that this unit overlies

unconformably the Solimões Formation (Miocene).

Quaternary sediments occur along the Amazon

River and its tributaries and consist of fluvial sand and

mud formed in meandering bars, floodplains, crevasse

splays, abandoned meanders and lakes setting (Nasci-

mento et al. 1976, Costa et al. 1978, Latrubesse and

Franzinelli 2002). In the southwest area of the city of

Manaus, Latrubesse and Franzinelli (2002) recognized

an ancient alluvial plain dominated by point bars, a

barred floodplain and a floodplain dominated by chan-

nels along of the Amazon River. The ancient alluvial

plain occurs in low, sandy terraces. The barred flood-

plain is characterizedbya largeareawith lakescompris-

ingmostlygreytogrey-greenishandmottled(yellowish)

ily, levees, crevasse splays andvariousdelta systemsoc-

cur. There is a predominance of the sand fraction in the

channel-dominatedfloodplains,where themain features

are channels, active sand bars, levees, inactive islands

and a system of abandoned channels.

Quaternary sediments in theAriaúRiver region, lo-

cated between the towns of Manacapuru and Iranduba,

comprise light grey to mid-grey sand and mud that lo-

cally intergradedwithsand layersup to1mthick. Soares

et al. (2001) recognized three levels of terraces, related

to theParanádoAriaúRiver, situatedbetween30mand

50mabovesea level, interpretedashavingbeingformed

on subsiding blocks (Fig. 5). These resulted from tec-

tonic processes associated tonormal faults, as explained

by Silva (2005). Three boreholes in this area indicated

aminimumthicknessof60mfor theseQuaternary sedi-

ments (Silva2005). Drainagepatterns suchas rectangu-

larandtrellis suggestastrongstructuralcontrol (Howard

1967). Moreover, the landforms exhibit ruptures on the

relief, rectilinear scarps, smooth surfaces and block tilt-

ing, being located on a lower topographical level.

Quaternary sediments in the Cacau-Pirêra area, lo-

catedat theconfluenceof theNegroandSolimões rivers,

consistofmudandcrossstratifiedsandrelatedtocrevasse

splaysandabandonedchannels. Thosedepositsoccur in

subsurface up to a depth of 20 m overling the Alter do

Chão Formation.

Several studieshaveproposeda tectoniccontrol for

the evolution of the Amazon River system in the study

et al. 2002, Igreja and Franzinelli 2002, Silva 2005).

Other studies have also shown that tectonic processes

According to the relief classification proposed by

Projeto Radambrasil (Nascimento et al. 1976, Costa et

al. 1978), the Rio Trombetas-Rio Negro Dissected Pla-

teau or Negro-Jari Plateau encompasses the Alter do

Chão Formation. The area to the south of the Amazon

River is included into the western domain of the Ama-

zon Lowered Plateau and the Central Amazon Depres-

sion, and consists of the deposits of the Içá Formation

(Bizzi et al. 2001). Finally, the Amazonian floodplain

comprises the Quaternary sediments in the floodplain

of the Solimões-Amazon rivers, at topographic levels

up to 25 m.

MORPHOSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

The relief of the study area presents distinct character-

istics in the northern, southern, and central portions. In

the northern portion, which includes the towns of Man-

aus, Iranduba and Manacapuru, the relief is relatively

high. It comprises well dissected, small to medium-

sized hills up to 100 m in height. To the north of Man-

acapuru, the relief is more preserved from erosion, with

mediumelevations (about50meters) andsub-horizontal

tops. Close to the rivers, however, the relief changes to

well-dissected and small forms, defininga characteristic

topographic alignment (Fig. 3C). The Ariaú River re-

gion, between Iranduba and Manacapuru, includes a flat

surface with levels not higher than 50 m, often flooded

and covered by Quaternary sediments.

The region to the south of the Solimões River, in

the central area, corresponds to the Amazon Lowered

Plateau, and comprises the towns of Careiro and Mana-

quiri. Its relief is low (around 50 m), with flat and dis-

sected tops and poorly-evolved drainage. In this region,

the Castanho River marks the boundary between two

lowered surfaces. On its left margin, on the outskirts

of Manaquiri, heightsare typicallybelow30m,whereas

the right margin exhibits altitudes between 30 m and

50 m. This configuration of the relief shows a gentle

unlevelling that may reach up to 20 m. Moreover, this

surface is in the same level of the Solimões River plain,

gettingmixedupwith terracesof theNegroRiver,Ariaú

River and of the right margin of the Manacapuru River.

Thisunlevellingbetweenthetwosurfacesbecomesmore

conspicuous when visualized through a 3-D model of

the DEM with high vertical exaggeration (Fig. 3D).

The Solimões River floodplain comprises an area

where the Quaternary sediments are distributed accord-

ing to the migrations of the river’s channel. The heights

of thecountless typesofalluvialdeposits (meanderbars,

natural levee, etc.), usually submerged under the rivers’

high waters, do not exceed 25 m. The relief of this re-

gion shows a group of tectonic landforms: fault scarps,

asymmetricvalleysandterraces,depressionsandanoma-

lous drainage patterns (such as rectangular types, mean-

dering forms, and drowned rivers). These features form

anasymmetric relief arrangement,which includes struc-

tural highs and lows, found on several of the relief com-

partments that occur in the Amazonia Plain.

The Negro River Fault is an important structure

mentioned by several authors, including Sternberg

(1950), Andrade and Cunha (1971), and Igreja and

Franzinelli (2002). This fault controls the margins of

that river for more than 70 km and it is easily recog-

nized on maps and satellite images as sets of rectilinear

scarps on both margins of the river. Its extension may

be noted in the western region of the Ariaú River, in the

contact between the Quaternary sediments and the Alter

do Chão Formation. It is possible that this fault extends

towards the Careiro region, forming the various NW-SE

lineaments seen in this region (Silva 2005). According

to Cordani et al. (1984), the Negro River Fault is a pos-

sible extension of structures of the Amazonian Craton,

suggesting that they were reactivated during the Palaeo-

zoic and Cenozoic times (Fig. 6A e B).

In the Ariaú River region, some landforms suggest

theoccurrenceofblockmovements, suchasparallel and

rectangular patterns in the course of the Acajituba River

(rightmarginoftheRioNegroRiver),alignedconfluence

of tributaries andalso theasymmetryof thedrainagebe-

tweentheblocks(longandshort segments). Anexample

of drainage asymmetry is the anomalous trellis pattern

of the Acajituba stream, enclose to the scarp of the Ne-

gro River (Fig. 6B). The parallel disposition of the wa-

tershed between the Acajituba and Miriti streams and

the asymmetric valleys of the Miriti and Manacapuru

rivers, along the NW-SE direction, are associated to in-

terfluvial zones on the relief.

Other NW-SE lineaments are observed in the Iran-

duba and Cacau-Pirêra region (Fig. 6B). These relief

lineaments represent steep scarpswith altitudesof about

50m, similar to those locatedon thewestern limit of the

city of Manaus, and are responsible for the rectangular

geometry of the Iranduba area (Iranduba Block). The

located. In the central portion of the block, the relief

shows residual dissected hills with sub-horizontal tops

that stand out in the landscape and may be visualized in

the DEM (Fig. 3C and D).

Between the scarps of the Negro and Iranduba

rivers there is a depressed region with altitudes up to

50m,with terraces formedonQuaternarysediments, to-

gether with Quaternary sediments from the Ariaú River

plain, both confined among Cretaceous deposits of the

AlterdoChãoFormation. In that sector, theAriaúRiver,

that links the Negro and Solimões rivers, lies asymmet-

rically on the plain due to the migration of the channel

towards east. The asymmetry of the channels is also ev-

ident in the Acajituba River. Close to the scarp of the

Negro River it presents a trellis pattern, as well as ano-

malous confluence of its tributaries. The depressed area

is controlled by the Negro River’s Fault. Farther west,

in the region of Manacapuru, the homonymous river

lies oriented NW-SE and presents asymmetric channels

and drowned mouth (the Manacapuru lake). The mor-

phostructural arrangement shows unlevelled areas, with

strong relief asymmetry, characterized by tectonic land-

forms and drainage anomalies associated to the Negro

River Fault.

Castanho River is the main tributary of the Soli-

mões River in the southern portion, showing a rectan-

gular pattern associated with ENE-WSW and NW-SE

lineaments and drowned-type drainage anomalies (Figs.

3C, D and 6B). The extensive areas of still waters rep-

resenting drowned rivers are called “lakes”, such as the

Castanho Lake. In this area, the formation of drowned

channels is associated with relief lineaments, which in

turnare responsible for thedevelopmentof the rectangu-

lar patternof the channels. The strongasymmetryof the

tributary channels indicates that the surface is slightly

lowered, dipping gently northward. Tributaries of the

Castanho River also exhibit an arrangement parallel to

the lineaments ENE-WSW. The rectangular drainage

pattern observed in the Castanho River region is con-

trolled by NW-SE lineaments (Fig. 6A).

Along its fluvial plain, the Solimões River shows

straight segments with former bar and meander situated

in asymmetric positions (Fig. 6B). To the southwest of

Manacapuru, the river suddenly changes its course from

E-W to NNE-SSW, for nearly 50 km. That region em-

braces a wide low area, with a flat relief which does not

surpass27m,dominatedbya seriesof lakes, suchas the

Cabaliana, Padre, Sacambu and Manacapuru, as well as

present and ancient bar deposits of the Solimões River.

Theboundariesofthealluvialplainsedimentsaremarked

by NE-SW and E-W relief lineaments.

This extensive lowered region narrows down near

Manacapuru, where the river suddenly changes the di-

rection of its course. P.E.L. Bezerra et al. (unpub-

lished data) mentioned the existence of a series of tec-

tonicdepressionswhichcontrol theQuaternarysedimen-

tation along the channel of the Solimões River. Silva

(2005) described several strike-slip and normal faults

and transtensive tectonic basins along the left bank of

the Solimões River between Coari and Manaus.Among

thesebasins, theManacapurupull-apartbasinstandsout,

with its peculiar rhombohedric form.

In the stretch between Manacapuru and Manaus,

the Solimões River follows an approximate E-W course

for about70km(Fig. 6B). In that stretch the river shows

evidences of erosion in both, the meander bars and the

deposits from the Alter do Chão and Içá formations.

Thus, an area with a wide and another with a narrow

floodplain becomes evident along the river. The paleo-

geographicreconstructionshowsthat theSolimõesRiver

presentedanE-Worientationon thisentire sector, possi-

blywithmeanderingcharacteristics. Through theanaly-

sis of SRTM and Landsat images, a lineament map was

produced (Fig. 6A), showing the relationship between

themorphostructural anomalies andmain structural fea-

tures (Fig. 7).

In Figure 7 a conspicuous set of lineaments can be

observed in the older units (Alter do Chão and Içá for-

mations), showinganevendistribution in fourdirections

(NE-SW, NW-SE, E-W and N-S). The analysis of these

lineaments reveals that they represent sheaves or frac-

ture zones. The E-W fractures are the most frequent

ones and have also longer accumulated length, in spite

of presenting no significant landscape elements. Frac-

tures along N50E and N30-60W are frequent, whereas

those in the N-S direction are less so. The coincidence

of the mapped fracture systems with the described tec-

tonic landformsallowed thecharacterizationof conspic-

uous tectonic lineaments along different directions. In

the NW-SE direction the interpreted lineaments were

named Manaus, Cacau-Pirêra, Iranduba, Negro River,

Miriti,ManacapuruRiverandManaquiri. AlongNE-SW

the lineamentsare: CastanhoRiver,CastanhoRiver-lake

Mamori,AcajitubaandSolimõesRiver (Padre lake). Fi-

nally, along E-W the lineaments are: Paricatuba, Mana-

capuru-Iranduba, lineaments of Careiro and southern

Castanho River (Fig. 8).

Morphostructural features along the NW-SE direc-

tion comprise fault scarps, aligned interfluves, asym-

metric patterns of the channels and the linear course of

the Negro River. They confirm that this river is con-

trolled by a normal fault zone, as suggested by Silva

(2005). This isalso thecaseof theQuaternarysediments

at low topographical level, thought to be tectonically-

controlled by normal faulting associated with the Iran-

duba, Cacau-Pirêra and Manacapuru lineaments. Some

authors referred to theNegroRiver regionas “theNegro

RiverGraben”, later interpretedbyIgrejaandFranzinelli
(2002) as a northeasterly tilted hemi-graben. However,

these authors analyzed the supposed graben only along

the margins of that river. The evidence presented in this

work indicates that this lineamentcomprisesasetofnor-

malfaults,whichextendbeyondthemarginsoftheNegro

The NE-SW lineaments seem to have imposed sig-

nificant control on the deposition of Quaternary sedi-

mentsalong thestraight segmentsof theSolimõesRiver.

Furthermore, these lineaments show up as remarkably

dissected zones, as in the Manacapuru region. In the

region located south of the Solimões River there is a

subsiding area associated with normal faults. Previous

work by Igreja and Franzinelli (2002) and Silva (2005)

referred to these NE-SW lineaments respectively as

transference,normalanddextralstrike-slipfaults. Those

authorsshowedthat these lineamentsareassociatedwith

a strike-slip system.

The E-W and N-S lineaments are more difficult to

characterize because their morphostructural expression

does not indicate the associated kinematics. The most

significantE-Wfeature is theParicatuba lineament, rep-

resenting the northern boundary of the Ariaú River. In

addition, other E-W lineaments may be seen cutting the

topography in the region of Manacapuru and Iranduba

and in the south of the Careiro region (Fig. 8). The N-S

structures are less expressive, represented by scarce sets

of lineaments on the region west of Manaus, in Man-

acapuru and east and west of Careiro. Based on the re-

gional tectonic model proposed by Hasui (1990), E-W

faults have been interpreted as dextral strike-slip faults,

whereas those along the N-S direction as normal faults

dipping to the west (Igreja and Franzinelli 2002).

As a result of the morphotectonics analysis pre-

sented here, three tectonic compartments were recog-

nized in the study area (Figs. 8 and 9). The first com-

partment comprises the northern portion of the area, en-

compassing thecitiesofManaus, IrandubaandManaca-

puru, and includes the asymmetric graben of the Ariaú

River (Fig. 9A and B). The western limit of this graben

is represented by the scarp of the Negro River Fault

scarp, coinciding with the contact between Cretaceous

and Quaternary units.

The second morphotectonic compartment is loc-

atedon the rightmarginof theSolimõesRiverandcorre-

spondstotheareawithflatreliefandrectangulardrainage

patterns. This compartment is marked by relief linea-

ments andaligneddrainage channels following theNW-

SE and NE-SW directions. The lineaments along these

two directions induce a parallel arrangement of the

drainage and relief, such as the fault scarp of Castanho

River and portions of the watersheds of its tributaries.

Theyalsocontrol stretchesof that riverandproducecon-

spicuousdrainageanomalies. Thedevelopmentofa typ-

ical rectangular pattern and the remarkable relief asym-

metry,markedbyescarpments, pointout to theexistence

of two blocks unlevelled by about 30 m, similar to the

Ariaúdepression. Themorphostructural featuresassoci-

ated with this compartment also include anomalous par-

alleldrainagepatterns,drownedportionsofCastanhoand

Mamori lakes, anomalousbendsandchannelasymmetry

(Fig. 9A). The relief elements and drainage anomalies

show a significant structural control of the present allu-

vial sedimentation. The extensive abandoned deposits

on the left bank of the Solimões River result from the

migration of the channel from NW to S-SE leading to

the present asymmetric position.

The third compartment is located west of Mana-

capuru and is represented by the alluvial plain of the

Solimões River. That area comprises part of the Purus

Rhombohedral Basin localized in western of this region

(Silva 2005).

The paleogeographic reconstruction shows that the

Iranduba region, bounded by the Cacau-Pirêra and Iran-

duba lineaments, was once part of the left margin of the

NegroRiver (Fig. 10A).Theancient channelof the river

was probably narrower and flowed along the Ariaú de-

pression and, from there, into the Solimões River (Fig.

10B). The proto-channel of the Negro River opened by

normal faulting that formed the Negro River Graben.

Thisprocessmadepossible thedevelopmentofsedimen-

tationat theconfluenceof theNegroandSolimõesrivers,

where the Ariaú River is situated today. The continu-

ous movement of the E-W binary produced the NW-SE

faulting observed west of Manaus and at Cacau-Pirêra

and Iranduba, resulting in the formation of fault scarps

(Fig. 10C). Normal faulting generated an opening into

which the Negro River was captured, thus changing its

flow direction from south to east and south-east, aban-

doning the channel where the Ariaú river currently lies

(Fig. 10D). This E-W lineament played an important

role in the capture process observed in this area. The

presence of ancient bar deposits indicates that the Soli-

mões River had meanders and was probably orientated

towards E-W, as currently seen between Manacapuru

and Manaus (Fig. 10E). The migration of the Solimões

River towards southeast would be the result of tectonic

processes, associated with the formation and evolution

of the Manacapuru Rhombohedral Basin (Fig. 10).

CONCLUSIONS

The main tectonic compartments of the western Ama-

zon Basin near Manaus were interpreted by means of

morphotectonic analysis, supported by orbital InSAR

(SRTM) and optical (Landsat ETM+) images and field

observations. The combination of modern remote sens-

ing technologies and three-dimensional visualization

tools enabled a detailed characterization of the relief

anddrainagepatternsof this region, unveiling subtle ter-

rain features related toCenozoic tectonicsof thewestern

AmazonBasin. The tectonic compartmentswerenamed

Ariaú Graben, Castanho-Mamori Graben and Manaca-

puru Basin.

The Ariaú Graben corresponds to an asymmetric

depression, where unlevelled Quaternary deposits are

bounded by the NW-SE Negro River Fault. Morpho-

structural features recognized in association with the

Ariaú Graben, include terraces, fault scarps, drainage

asymmetry and anomalies, such as rectangular and trel-

lis patterns, beheaded stream and drowned rivers.

The Castanho-Mamori Graben is a NE-SW rect-

angular asymmetric feature located at the right margin

of the Solimões River. Its main tectonic boundary is

the Castanho Fault, also orientated towards NE-SW and

plunging NW, controlling the course of the Castanho

River. Morphostructural features recognized in associ-

ation with this graben include relief anomalies, such as

fault scarps of the Castanho River, rectangular drainage

patternsanddrownedriverswhichformedMamori,Cas-

tanhoandJanauacá lakes. These features are interpreted

mostly as the result of faulting along NW-SE, NE-SW

and N-S, represented by the relief and drainage linea-

ments along the same directions.

The Manacapuru Basin corresponds to the depres-

sionwhere lakeCabaliana-Padrewasformedanddepicts

a rhombohedralgeometry. It is bounded to thenorthand

south by E-W strike-slip faults and to the east and west

by NE-SW normal faults, plunging NW and SE. In this

area, the sudden change of the course of the Solimões

River is caused by faults, marking the boundary of the

Manacapuru Basin.
