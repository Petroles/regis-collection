Actualmente, o desenvolvimento de novos biomateriais e de técnicas 
alternativas para o fabrico de implantes ortopédicos é muito importante. O 
objectivo da engenharia de tecidos é desenvolver soluções efectivas para o 
tratamento e regeneração óssea a longo prazo. O presente trabalho mostra 
uma nova alternativa para a fabricação de implantes ósseos com porosidade 
controlada, a qual pode ser modelada para a optimização dos mesmos. Foram 
preparadas tintas coloidais com elevada concentração de sólidos com o 
objetivo de poderem ser injectadas através da técnica de robocasting. 
Fosfatos de cálcio foram sintetizados e dopados com diferentes concentrações 
de estrôncio. Suspensões concentradas com 60 vol% de sólidos foram 
preparadas e modificadas de forma a alcançar as propriedades reológicas 
necessárias à conformação por robocasting. Diferentes arquiteturas tri-
dimensionais foram preparadas por deposição robótica, e depois secas e 
sinterizadas, mantendo a sua forma inicial.

abstract 

 
Nowadays, the development of new biomaterials and alternative techniques for 
the fabrication of orthopedic implants are of great importance. The objective of 
tissue engineering is to provide effective solutions in the treatment and healing 
of bone defects in a long-term. The present work gives a new option for the 
fabrication of bone scaffolds with controlled porosity that can be designed for 
the optimization of the implants. Highly concentrated colloidal inks were 
prepared with the aim of using them in a robotic deposition device called 
robocasting. Three types of calcium phosphate powders doped with strontium 
were synthesized, calcined, comminuted and characterized. Concentrated 
suspensions with 60 vol% of solid content were successfully prepared and their 
physical properties modified afterwards in order to obtain inks with optimal 
behavior for direct-write assembly.  Different three-dimensional architectures 
were made through robotic deposition, then dried and sinterized maintaining 
their shape.

1. Introduction 
Every year, there are millions of people around the world who need some kind of 

prostheses, and the need for all kinds of implants became very well known in our 

societies. The medicine field has experience great advances in the last decades and 

the main motivation for this was to increase life expectancy. According to the 

demographic forecasts for the near future in the developed countries, the percentage 

of elder people would be considerably bigger than in infants and teenagers. 

 

The massive longevity of the population encourages the researchers to develop new 

solutions that help to maintain a good quality of life at the elder age. The new motto is 

not only to preserve the life of patients but also to provide reliable long-term medical 

solutions. This has also positively influenced the surgical procedures bringing 

improvements in the techniques, and accelerated the development of new prostheses 

and orthopedic implants to replace or regenerate bone tissues. These should be 

made of biocompatible materials that ensure an acceptable lifetime for the patient, 

and provide the best performance.  

 

When bone suffers damage due to a fracture, disease (osteoporosis, for instance) or 

wear (in the case of joints), and there is a need to replace it either entirely or in a 

partial manner, the traditional method has been to use either autograft (a graft of the 

patient´s own bone) or allograft (a graft from another human, via a bone bank). The 

former requires a additional operation to harvest the bone (from the iliac crest, for 

example), and this results in increased pain, risk of infection, post-operative care and 

cost. The quantity of autograft available is limited according to each patient. Allograft 

bone is also limited in availability, and carries a serious risk of disease transmission, 

as well as non-optimal performance of the graft.
1
 

 

The new approach is to produce implants made of biomaterials to replace bone, 

which should match the functional requirements and characteristics of the natural 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           3 
 

tissue. This means that orthopaedic implants should be biocompatible, corrosion 

resistant, mechanically resistant, and promote osseointegration.  

2. Literature Review 

2.1. Biomaterials 

A biomaterial can be defined as any material used to restore a part or function of 

natural living tissue or organ in the body in a safe, reliable and physiologically 

compatible way.
2 

Biomaterials can be either synthetic as polymers, metals, ceramics 

and composites, or even biological as wood, bone and cells. Some examples of 

biomaterials as well as its advantages, disadvantages and possible applications are 

shown on Table 1.  They can be also classified according to their biological behaviour 

based on the response of the recipient living tissue or environment:
3
 

? Bioinert materials, when introduced to the body do not cause any reaction or 

interact with the biological tissue, meaning that the host won´t recognized them 

as a strange body. Examples: titanium, zirconia and alumina. 

? Biotolerant materials are not necessarily rejected by the host but rather 

moderately accepted by the recipient tissue which encapsulates the implant 

with a fibrous interface. Examples: stainless steel, glass, chromium-cobalt 

fibers and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). 

? Bioactive materials may cause a reaction or have an effect on the living 

environment, also due to their composition are capable of forming a direct link 

with the tissue. In the case of bone grafts, these materials have calcium and/or 

phosphate ions that help them to get attached to the surrounding bone. 

Examples: hydroxiapatite, bioactive glasses. 

? Biodegradable/reabsorbable materials are those that suffer of slow 

degradation and gradual substitution of the host tissue. Examples: tricalcium 

phosphate and bioactive glass. 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           4 
 

In order to achieve an optimal restoration of a bone graft, three different processes 

must take place:
4 

1) osteoinduction- estimulation for the production of sufficient 

osteoblasts (the mononucleate cells responsible for bone formation) and the factors 

to promote their differentiation are provided, 2) osteoconduction- these cells should 

be able to adhere, grow and infiltrate on the implant, and finally 3) osseointegration- 

the successful anchorage of an implant achieved by direct bone to implant contact. 

Looking for the ideal biomaterial for a specific bone restoration might become difficult 

considering that some materials match and even exceed the required mechanical 

properties, but do not promote these processes, or it can happen to be the other way 

around. For these reason, the best option is to combine two biomaterials with different 

mechanical, structural and chemical properties that can complement each other in a 

balanced manner. 

Table1. Class of Materials Used in the Body

2.2 Tissue Engineering 

When tissue is severely damaged or lost, including its extracellular matrix (ECM) it is 

not possible to restore it just with the supply of drugs, structural proteins and growing 

factors. It is necessary to provide a new biological or artificial ECM so the cells can 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           5 
 

produce neotissue. This substitute of the native matrix is called “scaffold” and it is 

basically a three-dimensional support that serves as a template for the infiltration and 

proliferation of cells into the damaged tissue or organ.
5
 The scaffold must have the 

architecture on which neotissue is desired to grow and provide sufficient support 

while the tissue is growing. In the case of bone scaffolds for orthopaedic applications, 

these should have enough mechanical resistance to withstand the required degree of 

loading during their use in vivo. 

Bone is constituted by different types of cells (osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, 

osteocytes, osteoclasts) which are in need of proper vascularization, and they are 

protected by a strong composite matrix made of interwoven fibrous proteins (collagen, 

adhesion proteins). Bone matrix is a natural composite  significantly mineralized (65% 

by weight) with a complex structure organized into lamellae (plate-like structure).
6 

It 

consists of collagen bundles which have been infiltrated by a crystalline mineral 

phase very similar to synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA)Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The main 

difference is that some of the tetrahedral [PO4]3- phosphate groups have been 

replaced by planar [CO3]2- carbonate groups, so it can be described as carbonated 

hydroxyapatite (CHA). It has been shown that “collagen and the apatite mineral form 

continuous, independent, interpenetrating networks”.
6-8 

As it can be seen of Fig. 1, bone is anatomically differentiated depending on its 

structural features and it can be defined as either compact (cortical) bone or spongy 

(cancellous or trabecular) bone. The compact bone is very dense with only 10% of 

internal porosity, and the spongy bone on the other hand has an interconnecting 

porous architecture ranging from 50 to 90% of porosity and made up of curvilinear 

struts called trabeculae.
6  

While the cortical bone is mainly found on the shafts of long 

bones like the femur and tibia, the cancellous bone appears at the ends of long bones 

and in the vertebral body.  

Bone scaffolds should have a certain degree of porosity according to the targeted 

spot of the bone to be restored. This porosity should be comprised of macro- and 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           6 
 

micro-interconnected pores that not only help to mimic the architecture of the 

replaced piece, but also contributes to the mass transport properties necessary for 

the osteoinduction, osteoconduction and osseointegration. Nevertheless, porous 

scaffolds are inherently weak, especially if they are made of calcium phosphates, and 

it is necessary to optimize their mechanical resistance so that they can give the 

required support while bone regenerates and they are slowly reabsorbed. This can be 

done by characterizing and simulating the mechanical performance of each specific 

three-dimensional architecture with the aid of a finite element modelling (FEM) 

software.
7 

Indeed, many features must be taken into account when developing an 

optimal scaffold for a certain application; properties of the material, morphology and 

structure, type and volume fraction of the pores, as well as its interfacial state and 

degradation rate.

2.3. Calcium Phosphates 

Calcium phosphate biomaterials are polycrystalline ceramics deriving from individual 

crystals of a highly oxidized substance (calcium salt) that have been fused together. 

The two most widely used are tricalcium phosphate Ca3(PO4)2 (in its ?-TCP phase or 

?-whitlockite), and hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2.
10

 Both materials are known to be 

biocompatible, osteoconductive and to promote osseointegration. However, they are 

not osteoinductive, meaning that they are uncapable of producing bone in the 

absence of bone cells. The main differences between these two materials is that 

tricalcium phosphate (TCP) presents faster in vivo degradation (due to its higher 

solubility in water), while hydroxyapatite provides better mechanical resistance.
8-10 

These bioceramics have been used for decades in orthopaedic and maxillofacial 

applications including: repair of bone and periodontal defects, alveolar ridge 

augmentation, ear implants, maxillofacial reconstruction, spine fusion, bone space 

fillers, bone cement additives, composites and metal implant coatings.
8   

Both of these 

two biomaterials show a promising future for bone tissue engineering applications by 

the fabrication of scaffolds.  

Tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite can even be mixed into a biphasic calcium 

phosphate material (BCP) that combines the great biodegradability of ?-TCP with the 

strong mechanical properties of HA.
11 

Increasing the ?-TCP/HA ratio will give a more 

biodegradable material since ?-TCP dissolves preferentially from its matrix, releasing 

calcium and phosphate ions to the media, enhancing the in vivo activity and 

decreasing the resorption time. Simultaneously, a higher ?-TCP/HA ratio will diminish 

the mechanical strength in the BCP material. However, it has been proved that the 

mixture of calcium phosphates turns out to be the ideal choice.
11 

Sintered hydroxyapatite has higher crystallinity than mineral bone and as a 

consequence a lower rate of degradation, so it can take more than five years to be 

reabsorbed by the body, while tricalcium phosphate can be completely degraded in 

one or two years.
12 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           8 
 

The ?-phase of tricalcium phosphate is unstable at low temperatures and it is 

obtained by heating the ?-phase at temperatures higher than 1150
o
C, although the 

precise temperature at which this occurs has not been found yet. On the other hand, 

?-TCP cannot be obtained by direct precipitation, it is rather the result from the 

calcinations of Ca deficient apatites at 700-800
o
C, together with water loss as 

described by the following equation:
13 

                                 Ca9(HPO4)(PO4)5(OH) ? 3Ca3(PO4)2+H2O                               (1) 

In the case of HA, it can be obtained by different methods such as 1) precipitation, 2) 

thermal treatments at high temperature or even 3) hydrothermal conversion from 

coral.
8-14

Since hydroxyapatite is non-stoichiometric it can be made by mixing 

solutions with calcium and phosphate ions in a Ca/P=1.67 ratio with a pH&gt;9. In the 

second method, HA is obtained by solid state reactions starting from other calcium 

phosphates (monetite or brushite) that contain CaO, Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 at 

temperatures around 1200
o
C and having an atmosphere with the same volumes of 

water vapour (as a source of OH
- 

groups) and oxygen.
14

On the third method, HA 

replaces the aragonite while preserving the porous structure. The following exchange 

takes place:
18 

       10CaCO3 + 6(NH4)2HPO4+2H2O   ? Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2+6(NH4)2CO3+4H3CO3   (2) 

In order to compare the properties of different calcium phosphate bioceramics (HA, ?-

TCP and BCP) J.Franco et al. prepared and tested dense ceramic samples by cold 

isostatic pressing at 1.4GPa followed by sintering in air.
11

 The results are shown on 

Table 2. The densities were determined by the Archimedes method. Flexural 

strengths were measured in four-point bending, while plane strain fracture toughness 

measurements were performed on single end notch bend specimens loaded in three 

point bending. 

On Table 3, the mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite are compared with those 

from other bioceramics and also from human bone (cancellous and cortical). As it can 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           9 
 

be noted, HA presents compressive strength values that are five times higher than 

compact bone and twice bending strength. However, cortical bone shows much better 

fracture toughness and significantly lower elastic modulus. For this reason HA is not a 

good option for repairing defects in high-load bones, such as femoral and tibial bones.

Lately, ionic incorporations into calcium phosphates bioceramics, such as magnesium 

(Mg), zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr), have had increasing interest in the bone tissue 

engineering field due to properties enhancement and the benefitial mechanisms that 

they induce after implantation.
16 

In the case of Sr, it became really popular in the 

prevention and treatment of osteoporosis as a ranelate compound due to its  ability to 

prevent bone loss by a mechanism of reducing bone resorption and promoting bone 

formation.
17

 In vitro studies have shown that strontium ranelate  increases collagen 

and non-collagen protein synthesis, enhances preosteoblastic cell proliferation, 

depresses osteoclast differentiation, and reduces the osteoclasts function.
18

Once it is 

administrated in the body as Sr salt, it seeks for bone and diffuses into the Haversian 

capillaries walls until it reaches the extracellular fluid where it can be deposited into

2.4. Solid Free-form (SFF) Fabrication Techniques 

Lately, the different additive manufacturing  (AP) techniques provide a suitable 

solution for designing and producing patient oriented customized implants at a 

reasonable cost. Such techniques are or also called solid free-form fabrication (SFF) 

or layered manufacturing since it builds an object layer by layer via the processing of 

solid sheet, liquid or powder material, using two- dimensional sections.
19

 This 

technology allows producing dimensionally-accurate three dimensional (3D) models 

directly from computer-aided design (CAD) files without using hard tooling, moulds or 

dies.
19 

Fortunately, the modern medical imaging techniques like computerized tomography 

(CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also based on layers and 

the format of the images can be transformed to a CAD file (Fig.2). This allows to take 

the medical images of the injured bone from any patient, and to use them to design 

and produce orthopaedic implants through additive manufacturing.

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           11 
 

The rapid manufacturing systems available on today include stereolitography, fused 

deposition modelling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), ink-jet and three 

dimensional printing (3DP), hot-melt printing, electron beam melting (EBM), and 

robocasting.
19

 

 

Conventional porous scaffold fabrication methods (including solvent casting along 

with particulate leaching, gas foaming, freeze drying, fibre meshing, melt moulding, 

phase separation and supercritical-fluid technology) do not provide precise control 

over pore size, geometry and spatial distribution.
21 

As a solution, SFF techniques are 

very useful for the design and fabrication of bone scaffolds with complex shapes, 

giving the advantage to create optimal internal porous structures that can provide the 

desired mechanical resistance along with the required permeability and diffusion 

properties, being possible to create interconnected porosity for osteoconduction and 

even internal channels for  the micro-vascularization of the scaffold.
21 

 

In order to fabricate bioceramic scaffolds, some of these solid freeform techniques 

fabricate the scaffold via an indirect process that involves the preparation of a lost 

mould (negative replica of the desired structure) made of an organic material (usually 

polymer or wax). The ceramic slurry is infiltrated into the mould, then dried and 

heated up at the melting temperature of the secondary material (to get rid of it), and 

finally the scaffold is sintered at a higher temperature.
22 

Such is the case of 

stereolitograhy and fused deposition modelling.

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           12 
 

The main problem with this indirect procedure is that the removal of the polymer or 

wax can delay for too long, it often takes days to obtain scaffolds that are free of 

organic defects.
23

 

The 3DP technique consists on distributing a powder over a surface over which a 

multi-channel ink-jet head selectively applies an adhesive (binder) which hardens the 

desire geometry of each section. The platforms move vertically until the piece is 

entirely finished by simultaneously covering the surface each time with a new layer of 

powder. There have been attempts to used CaP powders to produce scaffolds, 

though the main constraint is the toxicity of the binders.
24

 Also, the process itself 

produces scaffolds with rough surfaces and limited feature resolution.
23

 

 

Similarly, SLS also uses powder to make the template, but instead of injecting the 

binder it uses a sintering device that consists of an automated infrared beam which 

covers the section that will become solid. Researchers from the University of Texas at 

Austin,
25

 developed an indirect process for preparing porous, shaped implants made 

of calcium meta-phospthate powder (with a calcium to phosphorus molar ratio of 0.9) 

by selective laser sintering. Such powder is obtained after thermally reacting a 

mixture of monocalcium phosphate (MCP, Ca(H2PO4)2) and dicalcium phosphate 

(DCP, CaHPO4) at 1000 ?C for 12 h, then allowing to cool at 500 
o
C and the 

quenching in water. Afterwards, the powder was comminuted in a mechanical grinder 

at 20,000 rpm during 2 min, and then sieved with a size fraction of 106-125 µm in 

order to give a pore size distribution of 10-200 µm for the implant.  

 

The indirect process for  making CaP scaffolds through SLS  uses a fusible polymer 

binder that is either coated on the desired substrate particles, typically by fluidized 

bed processes, or simply mixed with those particles.The obtained implants (Figure 4) 

had a very low relative density (50%) due to the porosity, and their compressive 

strength (70 MPa) was not enough for load-bearing applications. However, they are 

suitable for maxillofacial applications of bone replacement, since in the in-vivo tests 

exhibited good biocompatibility and osseointegration.

2.4.1. Robocasting 

Also called direct-write assembly, differs from the other SFF techniques being the 

only one to allow building ceramic scaffolds using water-based inks with minimal 

organic content (&lt;1wt%) without the need for sacrificial support materials or 

mould.
26

This technique consists on the robotic deposition of highly concentrated 

colloidal suspensions (inks) capable of fully supporting their own weight during 

assembly. A 3D structure is printed directly as a network of ink rods through the 

deposition nozzle.
26

Robocasting allows to produce periodic structures with spanning 

features that vary between ~100µm and a few millimetres, with rod diameters that 

ranges also in the meso-scale. 

When preparing the ink, the important relations between colloidal stability, rheological 

behaviour, and ceramics fabrication must be taking into account.  First, they must 

exhibit a well-controlled viscoelastic response; that is, they must be able to flow 

through a deposition nozzle and then “set” immediately to facilitate shape retention of 

the deposited features even as they span gap in the underlying layers.
27

 Second, they 

must contain high colloid volume fractions to minimize drying-induced shrinkage after 

assembly; that is, the particle network must be able to resist compressive stresses 

arising from capillary tension.
27 

To obtain an ink with such characteristics, careful 

control of the colloidal forces is necessary to prepare a highly concentrated stable 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           14 
 

suspension and then induce a system change (by modifying the pH, ionic strength or 

solvent quality) that causes a fluid-to-gel transition, see Fig.5. 

 

Figura 5. (A) Schematic illustration of robocasting equipment and (B) optical view of robocasting head, 
which deposits a concentrated colloidal suspension in a layer-by-layer build sequence to generate 

complex, three-dimensional parts.
28 

 

The physical parameters that take place at the deposition of the ink through the 

nozzle are described by the following equation: 
29 

                                                                      ?r=r ?P/2?                                                  (3)                                                                 

where ?P is the pressure gradient applied along the nozzle length that provokes a 

radially varying shear stress (?r), r is the radial position within the nozzle (e.g. r=0 at 

the centre axis and r=R at the nozzle wall). Plug or laminar flow may occur within the 

nozzle depending upon the velocity profile and the ink stability.
29 

In recent years, different studies have been done remaining the fabrication of calcium 

phosphate scaffolds (HA, ?-TCP and BCP) by direct-write assembly.
7,11,21,23

 The 

results have been successful since it has been possible to produce scaffolds with 

relatively complex architectures that were dried, sintered and characterized 

afterwards. This encourages researchers to continue working on this line.   



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           15 
 

For instance, P. Miranda et al. have studied the mechanical optimization of porous 

ceramic scaffolds through the understanding and optimization of their macro- and 

micro-structure.
7,26,30 

This can be done with the aid of robocasting and the finite 

element method (FEM). They have fabricated HA and?-TCP scaffolds consisting of a 

3D square mesh of interpenetrating rods and tested them under uniaxial compression 

at different directions. In Fig.6 are shown some scanning electron microscope (SEM) 

images from one of the HA scaffolds. The ink used for robocasting had a final solid 

content of 35 vol%. Each layer from the CAD file consisted of parallel rods spaced 

400 µm from centre to centre. The rods from adjacent layers are orthogonal and the 

spacing between layers was set to 225 µm. The external dimensions of the scaffolds 

were set about 10x10x10 mm so that a total of 44 layers were deposited.

2.5. Colloidal Processing 

The term “colloid” is used to define any particle that possesses at least one dimension 

in the size range 10
?3

?1 µm while dispersed in a liquid or gas phase. Colloidal 

systems have a large contact area between particles and the dispersing medium.
28 

For this reason, surface forces have a strong effect on the behaviour of the 

suspension. Colloidal processing involves five different steps: 1) powder synthesis, 2) 

suspension preparation, 3) consolidation into the desired component shape 

(robocasting), 4) removal of the solvent phase (water and additives), and 5) 

densification (sintering) to produce the final microstructure required for optimal 

performance. This last step may also help to get rid of unintentional heterogeneities 

(or defects) introduced at any stage of the fabrication process.
 28

 

2.5.1. Interparticle Forces 

Depending on the magnitude and nature of the interparticle forces, colloidal 

suspensions can present a 1) dispersed, 2) weakly flocculated, or 3) strongly 

flocculated state. In the first state, the individual colloids are repelled when they 

nearly approach each other, having a repulsive barrier &gt;&gt;kbT. In the second state, 

colloids are aggregated into a shallow secondary minimum with a well depth?2?20 

kbT, having either the formation of isolated clusters (also called flocks) in suspension 

at lower volume fractions than the gel point (?&lt;?gel) or a particle network  at higher 

volume fractions (???gel).
28

When this happens, there is an equilibrium separation 

distance between aggregated particles. On the other hand, in the coagulated or 

strongly flocculated state, particles aggregated into a deep primary minimum, forming 

either discrete clusters or a touching particle network, depending on the concentration 

of the suspension.  

The stability of the suspension is controlled by the total interparticle potential energy, 

Vtotal, which can be described as follows:
 28

 

                                      Vtotal = VvdW + Velec + Vsteric + Vstructural                                                       (4) 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           17 
 

Where VvdW is the attractive potential energy due to long-range van der Waals 

interaction between particles, Velec the repulsive potential energy resulting from 

electrostatic interactions between like/charged particle surfaces, Vsteric the repulsive 

potential energy resulting from steric interactions between particles surfaces coated 

with adsorbed polymer species, and Vstructural  the potential energy resulting from the 

presence of nonadsorbed species in solution that may either increase or decrease 

suspension stability (Fig.7).

thickness, ? the adlayer thickness, and ?  the characteristic size of species resulting in ordering within 

the interparticle gap. (For depletion forces, ? is approximately the depletant diameter)

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           18 
 

There are five ways to modify the Vtotal and consequently the stability of a colloidal 

suspension by tailoring the different types of interparticle forces:
 28

 

a) van der Waals forces:Long-range forces from vdW interactions are omnipresent 

and always attractive between similar particles. These can be mitigated within the 

suspension until reaching the desired degree of stability. One approach is to 

completely diminish by suspending particles in and index-matched solvent. 

b) Electrostatic forces: In aqueous suspensions, the stability can be modified by 

providing similar charges of sufficient magnitude on the colloids surfaces. As 

predicted by the DLVO theory, colloidal systems can become unstable when the ionic 

strength is increased or the pH is adjusted toward the isoelectric point (IEP). 

However, it may be difficult to succeed generating stable dispersion based only on 

this approach. There may be solubility concerns that limit the working pH range, also 

an extended double-layer thickness can cause unacceptable drying shrinkage. 

c) Steric forces: Organic particles that can be adsorbed by the colloids are often 

supplied to the system to induce steric repulsion.This can be done in aqueous and 

non-aqueous dispersions. The added particles may have different molecular 

architectures such as homopolymers, diblock copolymers, comblike copolymers, and 

functionalized short chain dispersants.The density and thickness (?) of the adsorbed 

layers should be enough to vanquish the vdW forces between particles and to prevent 

connecting flocculation. In order to have steric interactions, the particles must 

approach each other at a separation distance less than twice the adlayer thickness. 

d)Electrosteric forces: polyelectrolyte species are widely used in colloidal 

suspensions to achieved both steric and electrostatic stabilization. These additives 

have at least one type of ionisable segment (e.g. carboxylic or sulfonic acid groups) 

and molecular architectures that include homopolymers, like poly(acrylic) acid, or 

block copolymers with one or multiple ionisable groups. Adsorption of these species 

is strongly influencedby the physical and chemical features of the colloids surfaces 

and the solvent medium. For instance, if the surfaces of the targeted particles are 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           19 
 

oppositely charged with respect to the polyelectrolyte, then adsorption is strongly 

encouraged. At small adsorbed amounts, these additives can induce flocculation due 

to surface change neutralizations or bridging mechanisms. At higher adsorbed 

amounts, colloid stability increases thanks to the long-range repulsive forces 

generated from electrosteric interactions. In Fig. 8, it is represented an example of 

modifying the adsorption behaviour and conformation of polyelectrolyte additives by 

tailoring the solvent conditions (e.g. pH and ionic strength). Assignments of the vdW 

plane, the plane of charge (?0) and the steric interaction length (?) must be taken into 

account when modelling the colloidal interactions. 

 

Figure 8. Schematic illustration of adsorbed anionic polyelectrolyte species on an ideal ceramic 

surface as a function of pH and ionic strength (? is the adlayer thickness and ?0 the plane of charge).
 28

 

 

e) Depletion forces: occur between large colloidal particles suspended in a solution of 

non-adsorbing smaller species (depletants) including polymers, polyelectrolytes, or 

fine colloidal particles. These can induce either flocculation or stabilization of the 

bigger particles. Depletion occurs with the presence of a negative depletant 

concentration gradient near primary particles surfaces. This starts at a distance 

defined as the depletion layer thickness which is related to the depletant diameter. By 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           20 
 

increasing the depletant volume fraction a suspension can experience transitions 

from stable ? depletion flocculation ? depletion restabilization. 

2.5.2. Suspension Rheology 

The critical parameters that govern the rheological behaviour of a colloidal 

suspension are the following: the apparent viscosity (?), the yield stress under shear 

(?y) and compression (Py), and the viscoelastic properties of the system such as the 

loss (G”) and the elastic (G´) moduli. All of these can be tailored by the use of the 

already discussed additives.
28

 

The fabrication of CaP scaffolds by robocasting requires the use of highly 

concentrated colloidal inks (???max) that can present excellent shape retention after 

the forming the porous structure. It is important to understand the ideal flow behaviour 

required for the successful ejection of a strong enough filament from the nozzle. If the 

ink is excessively fluid, it will have no trouble to flow out, however it won´t be able to 

retain its shape. In the opposite case, if the ink is overly viscous, if will struggle to flow 

out through the nozzle, and if it does there might occur rupture of the filament several 

times.  

Concentrated inks usually present a viscoelastic behaviour that can be recognized 

after performing dynamic rheological measurements (or oscillatory techniques). In this 

type of characterization, a frequency dependant shear stress or strain must be 

applied to the colloidal system in order to obtain the complex shear modulus (G*), 

which has a real (elastic, G’) and an imaginary (viscous, G”) component  represented 

as follows:
 28

 

                                                              G* = G’+ iG”                                                  (5) 

Where G’= G* cos ?, G”= G* sin ?, and ?is the phase angle. When a suspension is 

purely elastic (solid like), the applied strain and resulting stress are in phase (?=0), 

meaning that the energy is completely stored. On the contrary, when a suspension is 

purely viscous (liquid like), the energy is completely dissipated, and the applied strain 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           21 
 

and resultant stress are fully out of phase (??90
o
). Thus, a viscoelastic behaviour (gel 

like) should be at an intermediate range 0&lt;?&lt;90
o
. 

3. Experimental Procedures 

3.1. Powder Preparation and Characterization 

Three types of HA powders with different compositions were prepared as raw 

materials for the colloidal suspensions. One of the powder compositions was 

prepared with pure HA while the other two compositions were doped with 5%Sr and 

10%Sr. The calculations for the preparation of the solutions used in the synthesis of 

the powders had the following starting criteria (Ca+Sr) / P= 1.62. Assuming that the 

initial concentration of the initial P solution was fixed at 1.2M, the concentrations for 

the solutions of the other precursors were calculated in a way that maintained the 

starting criteria, meaning that the total concentration of the precursors (Ca and Sr) 

was 1.94M in the three cases. The quantities for the doping ions used for the 

synthesis were 0.097M (5%Sr) and 0.194M (10%Sr). The three different powders 

were prepared by chemical precipitation, starting from calcium nitrate 4-hydrate 

[Ca(NO3)2?4H2O] (Panreac Quimica S.A., Barcelona, Spain), di-ammonium hydrogen 

phosphate [(NH4)2HPO4] (Vaz Pereira-Portugal, Sintra, Portugal), and strontium 

nitrate [Sr(NO3)] (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), as chemical precursors for calcium, 

phosphorous and strontium respectively. 

For each powder synthesis, two solutions (P, Ca or Ca+Sr) were prepared with 

distilled water and predetermined concentrations, and then mixed homogenously 

using a magnetic agitator at 500 rpm during a few minutes. After stirring, both 

solutions were filtered through a 53 µm mesh to avoid contaminations and impurities. 

The Ca solution was poured inside a reactor (previously heated up to 90 
o
C) which 

was closed afterwards, and agitation was set at 1000 rpm. Then the P solution was 

poured inside the reactor using a peristaltic pump (Heidolph Pumpdrive 5206) and the 

flux rate was set at 86.8 ml/min. Once the complete addition of both solutions in the 

reactor was finished, ammonium hydroxide (ca. 25%NH3, Sigma-Aldrich) was added 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           22 
 

to the mixed solution in order to reach a pH=9 and maintain it. The precursors were 

let inside the reactor during 2h after addition. At the end of this, the precipitated 

suspension was removed from the reactor, filtered under vacuum to get the 

precipitated powder, which was dried at 100
o
C in an oven to remove the remaining 

solvent. Then, it was deagglomerated and calcined at 1000
o
C during 2h with a slope 

rate of 5
 o

C/min. Some samples were calcined at lower temperatures (400, 600, 700, 

800, and 900
o
C) for characterization purposes only. 

 After calcinations, the powders were ball milled in dry state during 15+15+15min. 

Samples of the three raw powders along with calcined powders at all the mentioned 

temperatures were subjected to X-ray characterization in order to  obtain information 

of their microstructures and phase changes. After ball milling, the particle size 

distribution of the powders was analysed in a laser dispersion instrument (COULTER 

LS230, UK) using a Fraunhofer optical model.  

3.2 Ink Preparation and Characterization 

The preparation of the CaP ink for robocasting was performed at three different 

stages: 1) preparation of a concentrated suspension, 2) addition of a viscosifier agent, 

and finally 3) addition of a gelifying agent. The same powders with the three different 

compositions (0%Sr, 5%Sr and 10%Sr) were used for this purpose. 

 The additives employed for the ink preparation were the following: ammonium 

polycarbonate (Targon 1128, BK Ladenburg, Germany) as a dispersant in order to 

get highly concentrated CaP suspensions, polyvynilpyrrolidone (PVP K90, mol wt. 

~360 000, Sigma-Aldrich) and hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HMC, mol wt. 410 

000, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as viscosifying agents, and polyethylenimine (PEI 

50% w/v in water, mol wt. 2000, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as gelifying agent.  

In a previous work, after comparing the ability of different dispersants for preparing 

highly concentrated HA suspensions, Targon 1128 revealed to be the most efficient, 

enabling to achieve up to 50 vol% of solid loading.
31

 It is an anionic-type dispersant 

that helps to develop high zeta potentials in the neutral or alkaline pH region where 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           23 
 

HA is thermodinamically stable, leading to an increase of the repulsive force among 

the colloids. Targon’s efficiency as dispersant and electrostatic stabilizer might be 

related to the composition of the functional groups along its polyelectrolyte chains.
31

  

Also calle hypromellose, HMC is an inert white to off-white powder that can be 

swelled in water to form a viscous colloidal solution. It can be an enteric film coating 

material or a matrix binder in solid dosage forms. It is used as a viscosity control 

agent, gelling agent, film former, stabilizer, dispersant, lubricant, binder, emulsifier, 

and suspending agent. End applications include adhesives and glues, agriculture, 

building materials, personal care products, detergents and surfactants, paints, printing 

inks, and coatings, pharmaceuticals, food products, polimerization and textiles. The 

viscosity of HMC 2% w/v varies within 50 to 50,000 cps. 
32 

Also known as polyvidone or povidone, PVP is a polymer that comes as highly cross-

linked flakes in its dry state.
 33

 It was initially used as a blood plasma substitute and 

later in a wide variety of applications in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics and industrial 

production.
 34

 An important property of PVP is its solubility in water and other polar 

solvents. Its ability to rise the viscosity of a suspension with increasing concentration 

depends essentially on the molecular weight.
33 

It has been used as a thickening agent 

in tooth whitening gels. 

Branched PEI is a cationic polymer which is liquid at room temperature, soluble in hot 

water, cold water at low pH, methanol, and ethanol. It has been already used as a 

flocculant in order to gellify robocasting with good results. 
35 

The evaluation of the minimum quantity of dispersant to be added (1 wt% with respect 

to the powder), in order to obtain a well dispersed suspension, was done according to 

rheological measurements performed with a rheometer (C-VOR Bohlin Instruments, 

USA). Suspensions with a solid content of 60 vol% were prepared by the mixture of 

the right amount of water and dispersant, and the subsequent addition of the powders 

in small amounts, giving time for homogenization between each powder depositi on. 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           24 
 

During this stage, the suspensions were agitated at 350 rpm using a stirrer (Ika Labor 

Technik RW20n).
 

In the second stage, increasing concentrations of viscosifying (HMC, PVP, and 

HMC+PVP)  together with a fixed amount of water, were added into the previously 

prepared concentrated suspensions (60 vol%) and then characterized with the help of 

a rheometer to get the right amount  to use which turn out to be 0.5 wt% with respect 

to the powder. After addition, the suspensions were placed in a container with small 

ceramic balls, and then place between mixing rolls during 24 h to achieve good 

homogenization. In consequence to the addition of water, the solid volume fraction 

decreased to 55 vol%.  

Similarly, in the last stage of the ink preparation, the gelifying agent was added (along 

with a certain amount of water) to the suspension on increasing amounts and mixed 

firmly by hand with a spatula, until the desired gel consistency (similar to a tooth 

paste) was obtained, always performing the appropriate rheological measurements 

with each amount. The solid content decreased to 50 vol% of CaP.  

Rheological tests were done at the viscommetry mode for the three stages of the ink 

preparation, and at the oscillatory mode (frequency sweep) only for the gelifying 

stage. For all the measurements, a cone-plate geometry (40mm diameter) was used 

with a gap size of 150 ?m, temperature was set at 25
o
C, and the samples were 

enclosed inside a metal ring cooled with di-ionized water in order to prevent 

evaporation of the suspensions during the tests.

3.3. Fabrication of the scaffolds 

Robocasting of the inks was done at the University of Badajoz, in the Department of 

Materials from the Faculty of Engineering. Three-dimensional periodic CaP scaffolds 

were fabricated using a robotic deposition device (3-D Inks, Stillwater, OK), illustrated 

in Fig. 9. The inks were prepared as described previously with the only difference that 

the homogenization, at the viscosifying and the gelifying stages, was performed 

inside a planetary centrifugal mixer (ARE-250, Thinky Corp., Tokyo, Japan) for a few 

minutes after each addition.Only PVP was used as viscosifying agent of these 

processed inks.  

The printing syringe was partially filled with the corresponding ink, tapped vigorously 

under small vacuum to remove bubbles, and then placed on a 3-axis motion stage of 

the robocasting device, controlled independently by a computer-aided direct write 

program (Robocad 3.0, 3-D Inks). 

In order to know the printing limitations of the inks, they were deposited through 

conical (plastic) and cylindrical (metallic) nozzles with diameters of 410µm, 330µm 

and 250µm, at three different printing speeds 10mm/s, 15mm/s and 20mm/s. Several 

architectures were consolidated using different computer 3-D models of the layers 

including the following features: squared, circular and triangular shapes, tetragonal 

and radial meshes, severalin-plane rod spacings (s), several layer spacings (h), 

several different external dimensions, and different numbers of printed layers. 

Deposition was done in a non-wetting oil bath to prevent non-uniform drying during 

assembly. The oil was removed manually using big pipettes and the samples were 

dried in air at room temperature for 24h and then at 400
o
C (1

o
C/min heating rate) for 

1h to remove the additives. Finally, the dried samples were sintered at 1200
 o
C with a 

slope of 3
 o
C/min during 2h.

spacing s and layer height h) are indicated.

4. Results and Discussion 

4.1 Particle size distribution 

This parameter is of critical importance for the preparation of robocasting inks. The 

smaller are the particles, the smaller will be their aggregates, having a smaller 

probability that one of these might obstruct the nozzle. The particle size distributi on 

was measured every time after the each ball milling step until obtaining results similar 

the ones presented in Fig. 10 and Table 4. Having relatively wide distribution makes it 

easier to prepare a highly concentrated suspension, since better packing behaviour 

might occur due to interparticle void filling of the smaller colloids can take place.

appearance of ?-TCP phase occurred at the spectrums from doped powders calcined 

at 800

C, while the pure 0%Sr powder calcined at the same temperature had no 

substantial changes. These first ?-TCP peaks had higher intensity in the 10%Sr 

powder compositionn. At 900
o
C the 0%Sr powder presented its first ?-TCP peaks, 

having a very similar spectrum than the 5%Sr powder that had no remarkable

changes, while the 10%Sr powder continue developing its ?-TCP phase. At 1000
o
C 

the three compositions increased the number and intensity of their peaks, meaning 

that they improve the crystallinity of both phases while the maximums where moved 

from the left side to the centre of the spectrum. After comparing all the 

mentionedXRD results, the influence of strontium on the enhancement of ?-TCP 

phase is more than evident. The results from the powders calcined at 1000

C are 

shown on Fig.11.

4.3 Rheological Measurements 

4.3.1. Viscometry mode 

The different possible types of flow behaviorthat can be observed when performing 

tests in the viscometry mode (under steady shear) depending on suspension 

composition and stability are illustrated on Fig. 12. The apparent viscosity (?) is 

related to the applied shear stress (?) and shear rate (?) by the expression ? =??.

Figure 12. Types of rheological behaviour exhibited by colloidal dispersions: (a) Newtonian flow; (b) 

shear thinning; (c) shear thickening; (d) Bingham plastic; and (e) pseudoplastic with a yield stress.
28

 

The results from the rheological measurements performed on the viscometry mode to 

the highly concentrated suspensions (60vol%of solid content) with increasing 

contents of dispersant are shown in Fig. 13. If we compare the curves with those from 

Fig.12, it is easy to identify that the suspensions present a pseudoplastic or shear-

thinning behaviour, meaning that the viscosity decreases along with the shear rate, 

while the shear stress does the opposite.Increasing the amount of Targon from 0.5- 

1.0wt% induced adecrement in the viscosity of the suspensions, adding more than 

this quantity leads to a raise of the viscosity. So, for the purpose of making highly 

concentrated suspensions, the lowest viscosity must be achieved.  

The rheological parameters monitored at suspensions with 55vol% solid content, 

1wt% of dispersant and increasing quantities of HMC are presented in Fig.14. The 

curves also present a shear thinning behaviour, although not so well defined as those 

in Fig.13. The more stable trajectory is presented with 0.5wt% of HMC, while the 

other three showed certain drops along the shear rate. Also, the consistency of the 

other three suspensions presented several lumps, thus when mixing with the gelifying 

agent, extremely aggregated pastes (unable to flow) were obtained. So the right 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           30 
 

amount in order to cause an ideal reaction in addition with PE was fixed at 0.5wt% for 

HMC, PVP and a mixture of HMC+PVP (0.25%+0.25%).

In Fig. 15, logaritmic curves for the measurements performed with the fixed 0.5wt% 

quantity for the three viscosifying additives were compared in order to know their 

effects before the addition of the gelifying agent. The weakest of the three was PVP, 

followed by the mixture HMC-PVP although not in the middle range as it may be

thought, and finally HMC displays a substantial increase on the viscosity of the 

suspensions.  

 

Figure 15.Comparison of the viscosifying effect of HMC, PVP and HMC+PVP  

The effect of strontium on the flow behaviour of the robocasting inks can be inferred 

looking at the profiles from Fig.16. With the same ammounts of additives in the 

suspension (1wt%T, 0.5wt%PVP, 0.4wt%PEI), the 0%Sr suspension presents higher 

viscosity than both Sr doped inks along all the shear rate. The 5%Sr and 10Sr% inks 

traced very similar trayectories that intersect each other several times.  

The graph in Fig. 17 shows the maximum added amounts of gelifying agent (PEI) 

among different combinations of suspensions tested. Obviously, the viscosifying 

additive employed was PVP since it is the weakest and allows to add more gelifier. 

The suspensions had 1wt% of Targon, 0.5wt%PVP and the following quantities of 

PEI: 0.4wt% for 0%Sr, 0.6wt%for 5%Sr, and 0.8wt% for 10%Sr. All the suspensions 

presented almost the same consistency at the time third stage of the ink preparation.

4.3.2 Oscillatory mode 

Structural information (liquid, gel, solid) can be inferred from the results of the 

frequency sweeps at a given stress (or strain) performed on the CaP suspensions. In 

Fig. 18, the models for the three possible types of response that can be obtained from 

such tests are illustrated. A liquid-like response is observed when G”&gt;G’ along the 

entire frequency spectrum, these vary as w and w
2 

, respectively, as w?0. A gellike 

response is observed when G’and G”vary as w
j
, where j = 0.3 – 0.7, depending on the

system. A solid-like response is observed when G’&gt; G”along the frequency spectrum, 

where G’is independent of frequency as w?0.
28

 

 

Figure 18.Schematic representation of oscillatory behaviour as a function of frequency for (A) liquid, 

(B) gel, and (C) solid response.
28 

On Fig. 19 are shown the results from oscillatory sweeps performed at samples from 

the three different compositions previous to the addition of the gelifying agent 

(0%PEI). The 0%Sr suspension presented a higher elastic response compared to 

those obtained from the doped inks. Also, former shows a more pronounced rheo-

viscosifying behaviour than the strontium compositions. This means that by 

increasing the frequency (flow rate) the inks  present a more viscous consistence. For 

the three different suspensions, the elastic modulus (G’) stays relatively stable along 

the frequency sweep, while the viscous modulus (G”)  presents slopes which are 

more tilted at frequencies below 1Hz. The previous statements confirm that the 

suspensions present a solid-like response in all the oscillatory results. This is mainly 

due to the high solid particles concentrations on the inks, higher than fifty volume 

percent. On the results from Fig. 20, the suspensions were added with 0.4wt% 

amount of PEI. As expected, the three inks continue presenting a solid-like response 

but at much higher scale, meaning that the valuesfor both modulus are substancially 

bigger, specially for the viscous one. Another change is that the elastic modulus 

shows slight slopes in the three cases. The0%Sr suspensions has a much greater 

rheo-viscosifying behaviour compared to the doped suspensions and to its previous 

result with no PEI addition. The 10%Sr ink showed a higher viscous modulus during 

the entire oscillatory frequency sweep.

4.4 Robocasting of scaffolds 

The robotic depositions were performed using three different inks (0%Sr-55vol%-

0.5wt%PVP-0.4wt%PEI, 5%Sr-50vol%-0.5wt%PVP-0.6wt%PEI, and 10%Sr-50vol%-

0.5wt%PVP-0.8wt%PEI) and three different nozzle tips (red-conical-plastic-250µm, 

orange-cylindrical-metallic-330µm, and blue-conical-plastic-410µm). The geometry 

and diameter of the nozzle tip is a critical factor that may cause failure of the ink 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           35 
 

deposition. For instance, only one sample was achieved to be successfully printed 

through the smaller red nozzle with the 0%Sr ink. It had a cubic architecture (1cm
3
) 

with tetragonal mesh, outer support ring, rod diameter d=250µm, horizontal center to 

center spacing between rods s=500µm, vertical spacing between layers s=200µm.  

The main problem source seems to be the generation of bubbles within the inks, 

which are really difficult to remove, thus they are trapped in the syringe where they 

flow along with the ink until they get trapped at the nozzle because their superficial 

tension is higher than the injecting pressure of the deposition device. So when this 

happens, either the process may be completely interrupted and the nozzle tip must be 

removed, or the process may suffer a delay on the injection while the pressure is 

overcome and the bubble extruded, but this causes a dramatic increase on the flow 

thus imperfections on the template. Issues of this kind where experienced when using 

the orange nozzle, although in leaser degree than with the previous. The blue nozzle 

was optimal since its relatively big diameter enabled the bubbles to be easily ejected 

without causing imperfections.  

A total number of twenty samples were produce by robocasting, four pairs of identical 

scaffolds and sixteen with different characteristics (Table 5). The spanning features 

had different shapes and sizes up to the range of a few milimiters of separation 

between rods. This is difficult to achieve and requires very good physical properties of 

the ink, since flow is usually aided by the traction of the filament with the substrate or 

with the underlying rods, so when this aid is absent the filament must have really 

good characteristics in order to flow by itself and to maintain its shape without 

bending once it is linked.  

The picture on Fig. 21 shows the sixteen different types of scaffolds fabricated. 

Sample 1 was done using a red nozzle (d=250µm), samples 4,5,7,8 and 9 were done 

using an orange nozzle (d=330 µm). The remaining samples 2,3,6 and 10-16 were 

fabricated with a blue nozzle (d=410 µm). The scaffolds with squared layers have one 

centimeter per side and different heights due to different number of printed layers. 



                                            
 

European Master in Materials Science                                                                                                                           36 
 

Some of them may look the same but may differ either on having a supporting 

external ring or different ink composition. The cylindrical architectures have a 

diameter of 1.5cm with internal holes diameters of 3mm and 6mm. The triangular 

scaffold has 1cm on the base and it is 1.8cm long. The shrinkage after sintering was 

around 15% compared to the initial volume for all the specimens.

Conclusions 
The objectives of the present work were to prepare different types of CaP powders, to 

incorporate such powders into highly concentrated colloidal suspensions, to taylor 

their physical properties until they became suitable for robocasting, to observe the 

behavior of the inks at robocasting, and then after drying and sintering of the 

produced scaffolds.  

Three different HA powder compositions (0%Sr, 5%Sr and 10%Sr) were prepared, 

milled, and calcined at 1000
o
C. At this temperature, all the powders presented a 

second CaP phase, beta-tricalcium phosphate. However, it was noticed through the 

XRD results that increasing the content of Sr enhances the development of ?-TCP 

phase. 

The robocasting inks were prepared and tailored with the help of different additives 

such as dispersing agent (Targon), viscosifying agents (HMC and PVP), and gelifying 

or flocculating agent (PEI). The final solid content achieved on the suspensions was 

fifty volume percent (50vol%). Such inks presented a viscoeslastic behaviour on the 

rheometer, as well as a solid-liker rheo-viscosifying response on the oscillatory tests.  

Finally, twenty scaffolds were successfully produced through the direct-writte 

assembly technique using different nozzle geometries (conical and cilindryical), 

materials (plastic and metallic) and tip diameters (250µm, 330µm and 410µm). 

Relatively complex architectures were successfully consolidated and maintained their 

shape after drying in air and upon sintering at 1200
o
C. Considering the 50vol% water 

and organic content, the shrinkage after these two processes was less than the 

expected, around 15% of the initial volume for all the architectures.  

Further work must be done in the near future to characterize the samples produce 

with these CaP inks; for instance, performing mechanical and biological tests in order 

to have a better idea of thein-vivoperformance of these scaffolds.
