Zooplankton communities of the North-Eastern Atlantic - Portuguese offshore waters  

ABSTRACT 

Zooplankton plays a key role in ecosystem functioning, as they represent the interface for 

energy transfer between primary producers and planktivores. Data on zooplankton, although 

essential to correctly assess the state of marine ecosystems, is still lacking for several regions were 

the need for answers is crucial. This work aims at establishing a baseline of knowledge on the 

zooplankton communities in the study area and finding relationships between copepod distribution 

(beta-diversity) and environmental and spatial factors.  

The study area was located off the coast of Portugal, limited between 42º and 35ºN and 

14º and 9,5ºW. Sampling was conducted on 22 sites using a Bongo net towed from the rear of the 

ship in a double oblique design until a maximum depth of 215m, and at each site two samples 

were collected, one for biomass quantification and the other for taxonomical identification. 

Results showed that spatial effects were the primary drivers of variation on zooplankton 

biomass, MTG assemblages’ composition and copepod beta-diversity, along with spatially 

structured environmental variation, which also had an important role. Zooplankton biomass 

showed the greatest dependence on spatial effects (along with spatially structured environmental 

variation), showing that biomass alone might not be so susceptible to occasional changes in the 

environmental variables. MTG assemblages’ composition and copepod beta-diversity showed more 

complex patterns of variation, but the predominance of spatial effects is a result that, although 

contrary to the general trend, is in accordance with the hypothesis that inter-regional variability is 

more complex than a correlation with Sea Surface Temperature. The establishment of a baseline 

of data for our study area on the studied parameters, especially copepods, is probably the most 

important conclusion. Calanoid copepods were, as expected, dominant throughout the study area, 

represented by the genus Calanus, and more specifically, Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863).

Comunidades de zooplâncton no Atlântico Nordeste – águas offshore Portuguesas 

RESUMO 

O Zooplâncton desempenha um papel fundamental no funcionamento dos ecossistemas, 

uma vez que representam o interface para a transferência de energia entre os produtores 

primários e os organismos planctívoros. Apesar de essencial para avaliar o estado dos 

ecossistemas marinhos, a informação sobre zooplâncton é ainda escassa em várias regiões onde 

existe urgência em obter respostas. Este trabalho teve como objetivos estabelecer uma base de 

conhecimento acerca das comunidades zooplânctónicas na área de estudo e procurar relações 

entre a distribuição de copépodes (beta-diversidade) e factores ambientais e espaciais. 

O estudo desenvolveu-se ao largo da costa de Portugal, entre os 42º e 35º Norte e os 14º 

e os 9,5º Oeste. A amostragem foi realizada em 22 locais, através da utilização de uma rede 

Bongo rebocada a partir da traseira do navio num design duplo-oblíquo, atingindo uma 

profundidade máxima de amostragem de 215m. Recolheram-se 2 amostras por local, uma para 

quantificação de biomassa e outra para identificação taxonómica. 

Os resultados mostraram que os efeitos espaciais, em conjunto com a variação ambiental 

espacialmente estruturada, são os principais responsáveis pela variação na biomassa de 

zooplâncton, composição dos GGT e beta-diversidade de copépodes. A biomassa mostrou a maior 

dependência de efeitos espaciais (com variação ambiental espacialmente estruturada), o que 

mostra que a biomassa, por si só, poderá não ser tão susceptível a oscilações nas variáveis 

ambientais. A composição dos GGT e a beta-diversidade de copépodes mostraram padrões de 

variação mais complexos, mas a predominância dos efeitos espaciais é um resultado que, apesar 

de contrário à tendência geral, está de acordo com a hipótese de que a variação inter-regional é 

mais complexa do que a simples correlação com a temperatura da superfície do mar. O 

estabelecimento de uma base de conhecimento para a área em estudo, especialmente em relação 

aos copépodes, é provavelmente a conclusão mais importante deste trabalho. Os copépodes 

calanoides revelaram-se dominantes na área de estudo, representados pelo género Calanus, mais 

especificamente, pelos Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863).

1. INTRODUCTION 

Environmental monitoring data collection is essential to correctly assess the current state 

of marine ecosystems, but monitoring programs are still lacking in many regions were answers are 

seriously needed (Calbet, Atienza, Henriksen, Saiz, &amp;amp; Adey, 2009; Suikkanen et al., 2013). 

Phytoplankton and zooplankton dominate the oceans biodiversity, and are both the basal and vital 

components of the marine (and freshwater) food chains. Plankton communities can function as 

“canaries-in-a-cage”, accumulating the effects of change in a myriad of parameters, thus reflecting 

alterations that a single snapshot cannot capture (Roemmich &amp;amp; Mcgowan, 1995; Suthers &amp;amp; Rissik, 

2009). 

 

1.1 WHAT IS PLANKTON?  

Life had its origins in the oceans about four thousand million years ago, and nowadays 

almost all major taxonomic phyla have at least one representative living there. Plankton comprises 

some of the most evolutionary simplest and numerous life forms in the oceans (although 

chordates are also present in plankton), and it forms a taxonomically heterogeneous group of 

microscopic autotrophs (phytoplankton), animals (zooplankton) and microbes (bacteria, Archaea 

and viruses). This definition of plankton is in some ways rather loose, since we often include in it 

active swimmers like jellyfishes (and other gelatinous organisms) and euphasids (krill), that should 

be technically referred as “nekton” (Suthers &amp;amp; Rissik, 2009).  

Phytoplankton is the autotrophic component of the plankton community, photosynthesizing 

organisms that inhabit the sunlit layers of the ocean. These single-celled organisms form the basis 

of ocean productivity, producing organic compounds (such as sugars and proteins) from carbon 

dioxide dissolved in the water, a process called primary production that sustains the aquatic food 

web (Hasle &amp;amp; Sournia, 1978; Suthers &amp;amp; Rissik, 2009). Phytoplankton contains photosynthetically 

active pigments, such as chlorophyll, that give the oceans a range of colors that are used to 

indirectly quantify the concentration of chloroplhyl ?, a surrogate for phytoplankton concentration, 



 4 

using remote sensing technologies such as satellites with specific sensors (eg.: Modis, SeaWifs) 

(Hátún et al., 2009; Hooker &amp;amp; Esaias, 1993; Ana Picado, Alvarez, Vaz, &amp;amp; Dias, 2013). 

The main target of this thesis, zooplankton, is a community of animals that live adrift in the 

water, which possess an extremely limited capacity to counteract the movements of water (eg.: 

currents) through swimming. Taxonomically, zooplankton presents a wide range of classification, 

ranging from the most primitive unicellular organisms (protists) to vertebrates (fish larvae). 

Regarding their life cycle, some species spend their entire life suspended in water (eg.: copepods), 

without contact to solid surfaces (holoplankton), while most benthic invertebrates and fishes 

usually have some  early-life phase in which they experience a transitory planktonic life 

(meroplankton) (Alcaraz &amp;amp; Calbet, 2009). Zooplankton is present on the world’s oceans as an 

enormous variety of organisms, such as cnidarians, amphipods, copepods and ostracods, among 

many others (Figure 1).

Zooplankton, being so ubiquitous, plays a key role in ecosystem functioning (Beaugrand, 

Reid, Ibañez, Lindley, &amp;amp; Edwards, 2002), as they are the most important secondary producers in 

oceans and represent the interface for energy transfer between primary producers and planktivores 

(Suikkanen et al., 2013). These grazers represent an essential trophic pathway for the transfer of 

organic carbon from phytoplankton to fish (Suthers &amp;amp; Rissik, 2009), and they also contribute to the 

nutrient pool via their excretions, fecal pellets that are either recycled within the water column or 

used by bottom feeders 

 

1.2 WHY STUDY ZOOPLANKTON? 

Zooplankton exists throughout the 1,5 x 109 Km3 of water that form the world’s oceans, 

making it one of the most ubiquitous association of organisms on earth. Since zooplankton 

constitutes a critical food source for superior trophic levels, like all fish larvae and many 

commercially important planktivorous fish (Roemmich &amp;amp; Mcgowan, 1995), they are the primal 

influence on structuring pelagic ecosystems (Labat et al., 2009). In effect, zooplankton (along with 

pelagic nekton) packages planktonic primary production into forms available for marine birds and 

mammals, fishes and humans (Johnson et al., 2011). Thus, the need for knowledge on 

zooplankton has implications for the correct management of fish stocks (McGinty, Power, &amp;amp; 

Johnson, 2011) and other activities of economic interest, as well as for the understanding of 

migratory routes taken by threatened cetaceans and their feeding patterns (Durbin et al., 2002). 

Understanding zooplankton communities and its dynamics is a key component to understand life 

on our planet (Burkill &amp;amp; Reid, 2010). 

Zooplankton also plays other key roles, with even deeper implications, has they concern 

the interactions between climate change and ecosystem function (Beaugrand et al., 2002; McGinty 

et al., 2011; Roemmich &amp;amp; Mcgowan, 1995). Marine zooplankton are important indicators of 

environmental changes (Schnack-Schiel, Mizdalski, &amp;amp; Cornils, 2010). Considerable changes in 

zooplankton phenology have been detected recently, such as increases in the proportion of small-

sized species and young age classes (Suikkanen et al., 2013). Distribution and abundance of 



 6 

zooplankton have also been demonstrating alarming trends, with measured decreases of 80% in 

zooplankton volume in some areas in a forty year span (Roemmich &amp;amp; Mcgowan, 1995). Even 

though long time-series are relatively rare, available data shows that zooplankton exhibits range 

shifts, in response to global warming, that are among the fastest and largest of any marine or 

terrestrial animal group (Beaugrand et al., 2002; Richardson, 2008). The general trend, as for land 

animals, is for zooplanktonic organisms to expand their ranges polewards, as temperatures 

increase. These kinds of shifts in distribution have profound effects on community structures and 

food webs (Beaugrand, Brander, Alistair Lindley, Souissi, &amp;amp; Reid, 2003). Zooplankton also has an 

immeasurable influence in oceanic carbon fluxes, as they are one of the primary mechanisms for 

the transfer of carbon from surface waters to the deeper waters and sediment (Gallienne, Robins, 

&amp;amp; Woodd-Walker, 2001). It is extremely important to monitor plankton associations, because 

changes in community structure reflect the adjustment of pelagic ecosystems to modifications in 

water masses, currents and/or atmospheric forcing. Monitoring will provide us a valuable mean of 

checking the well being of marine ecosystems, possibly in several oceanic regions (Beaugrand et 

al., 2002). 

In this work, I focused on copepod (subclass Copepoda) biodiversity and biomass, as 

zooplankton communities in the study area are dominated by them (Bonnet et al., 2005), 

particularly cyclopoids (order Cyclopoida) and calanoids (order Calanoida) (Goetze &amp;amp; Ohman, 

2010; Miyashita, de Melo Júnior, &amp;amp; Lopes, 2009). Copepods also are the most abundant 

multicellular animals on Earth, even outnumbering insects by possibly three orders of magnitude 

(Schminke, 2006), thus showing their importance for community structure. Over the last decade 

several authors have highlighted observed changes in zooplankton distribution and abundance, 

specifically biogeographical shifts of calanoid copepod communities, with warm-water species 

shifting northwards, and cold-water species retreating northwards (Beaugrand et al., 2002; 

Edwards, Johns, &amp;amp; Beaugrand, 2008). Moreover, even though the warm water species (Calanus 

helgolandicus (Claus, 1863)) is replacing a cold water species (Calanus finmarchicus (Gunnerus, 

1770)), the actual total abundance of Calanus is decreasing (Edwards et al., 2008). Even tough 

these shifts have been measured in the northern European waters (north sea and northwards), it 



 7 

has been so abrupt that similar changes must be considered for other regions, thus validating the 

need of investigation on copepod diversity and abundance in the study area. 

 

1.3 THE NORTHEAST ATLANTIC – PORTUGUESE CONTINENTAL AND OFFSHORE 

WATERS 

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean of the Earth, with an area of 82 million 

km2. Despite this, the knowledge about the planktonic communities inhabiting it is limited (Calbet 

et al, 2009), and for some regions, it simply does not exist (McGinty et al, 2011). Specifically on 

the offshore Portuguese waters, the paucity of information is an almost unsurpassable reality. 

Hitherto, surveys covering Portuguese waters were either located on the coastal upwelling zones 

and estuaries (Continental Shelf) (Queiroga, Silva, Sorbe, &amp;amp; Morgado, 2005), or near seamounts 

(Martin &amp;amp; Christiansen, 2009). Sea floor topography is complex and heterogeneous in this area, as 

it includes the Portuguese continental shelf and several seamounts, canyons and plains. The 

northern section consists of the Vigo and Andromeda seamounts, the central of the Carvalho 

Araújo through, Estremadura spur and Tagus basin, and the southern of the Gorringe Ridge (which 

includes the Ormonde and Gettysburg peaks, rising less than 50 meters beneath the surface), 

Ampère seamount and the Horseshoe and Ferradura plains, among other minor structures. The 

most relevant structures of the continental shelf are the Nazaré, Setúbal and Lagos canyons and 

Infante D. Henrique hill. In the continental shelf and coastal areas coastal upwelling is the most 

prominent phenomenon in terms of water circulation and dynamics. The northwestern coast of the 

Iberian Peninsula is the northernmost limit of the Eastern North Atlantic Upwelling System (Ana 

Picado et al., 2013), and during the late spring and summer (Peliz, Rosa, Santos, &amp;amp; Pissarra, 

2002), the coastal ocean of Portugal is under the influence of northerly winds that drive an 

offshore Ekman Transport, forcing the upwelling of subsurface waters, a phenomenon evidenced at 

the surface by cold, less salty and nutrient-rich waters (Figure 2) (Peliz et al., 2002; Sousa, 

Nascimento, Casimiro, &amp;amp; Boutov, 2008). Extending from June to September, the upwelling effects 

extend from the coast up to 250km into the ocean, with upwelling filaments providing a major 

shelf-ocean exchange mechanism (Peliz et al., 2002; Sousa et al., 2008). These filaments, 



 8 

offshore oriented and up to 40km wide, transport upwelled waters to the deep ocean (see: Sea 

Surface Temperature on Figure 2) and may have different origins (Peliz et al., 2002). Those 

anchored to capes are probably related to topographic forcing, and those in areas of smooth 

coastline and bathymetry are probably related to evolution of frontal instabilities (Peliz et al., 

2002). However, according to Lemos &amp;amp; Pires (2004), the upwelling regime has been weakening 

since the mid 1940’s, therefore reinforcing the need to study these areas.  

 

Figure 2. Seasonal Sea Surface Temperature and Chla concentration for the summer of 2011 (adapted 
from http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3) 

In oceanic waters, five main water masses have been identified, from bottom to top: the 

Lower Deep Water (LWD), composed mainly of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and flowing 

regionally below the 4000m, mainly across the abyssal plains; the North Atlantic Deep Water 

(NADW), which flows in various directions 4000 and 2200m; the Labrador Sea Water (LSW), 

circulating regionally towards the southwest between 2200 and 1500m; the Mediterranean 

Outflow Water (MOW), located between 1500 and 600m, which flows to the north and west along 

the middle slope around the Iberian margin; and the North Atlantic Central Water (NACW), 

characterized by a complex circulation pattern involving different currents and directions between 



 9 

600m and the surface, making it one of the most influential water masses, along with the MOW, in 

regard to this thesis (Hernández-Molina et al., 2011). The surface circulation is extremely complex, 

as depicted in Figure 3, but it is observable that the main currents affecting the surficial circulation 

are: the Subarctic Intermediate Water (SAIW); the Atlantic Current (AC); the North Atlantic Current 

(NAC); and the Iberian Polar Current (IPC) (Hernández-Molina et al., 2011). Small-scale circulation 

is also affected by seamounts. These seamounts may give rise to different kinds of phenomena 

and disturbances, like an increase in the speed of sea currents, local upwellings, turbulence, 

eddies, among others (Roden, 1987). The study area was located off the coast of Portugal, 

containing coastal, offshore and oceanic waters, limited between 42º and 35º in latitude and -14º 

and -9,5º degrees in longitude (Figure 3).

2. OBJECTIVES 

Given the shortage of information for the Portuguese offshore waters, this study focused on 

the distribution, biodiversity and biomass of zooplankton, namely copepods, as they are the most 

abundant multicellular animals on Earth, even outnumbering insects by possibly three orders of 

magnitude (Schminke, 2006).  

Our main objectives were:  

a) To establish a baseline of knowledge on the zooplankton communities in the study area.  

b) To find relationships between copepod distribution (beta-diversity) and environmental 

and spatial factors.  

These objectives will contribute to facilitate a better understanding of global patterns of 

biodiversity and changes in community structure.

Zooplankton plays a key role in ecosystem functioning, as they represent the interface for 

energy transfer between primary producers and planktivores. Data on zooplankton, although 

essential to correctly assess the state of marine ecosystems, is still lacking for several regions were 

the need for answers is urgent. This work aims at establishing a baseline of knowledge on the 

zooplankton communities in the study area and finding relationships between copepod distribution 

(beta-diversity) and environmental and spatial factors. The study area was located off the coast of 

Portugal, containing coastal, offshore and oceanic waters, limited between 42º and 35ºN and 14º 

and 9,5ºW. Results showed that spatial effects were the primary drivers of variation on zooplankton 

biomass, MTG assemblages’ composition and copepod beta-diversity, along with spatially 

structured environmental variation, which also had an important role. Zooplankton biomass 

showed the greatest dependence on spatial effects (along with spatially structured environmental 

variation), showing that biomass alone might not be so susceptible to occasional changes in the 

environmental variables. MTG assemblages’ composition and copepod beta-diversity showed more 

complex patterns of variation, but the predominance of spatial effects is a result that, although 

contrary to the general trend, is in accordance with the hypothesis that inter-regional variability is 

more complex than a correlation with Sea Surface Temperature. The establishment of a baseline 

of data for our study area on the studied parameters, especially copepods, is probably the most 

important conclusion. Calanoid copepods were, as expected, dominant throughout the study area, 

represented by the genus Calanus, and more specifically, Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863).

3.2 INTRODUCTION 

Environmental monitoring data collection is essential to correctly assess the current state 

of marine ecosystems, but monitoring programs are still lacking in many regions were answers are 

seriously needed (Calbet et al., 2009; Suikkanen et al., 2013). The Atlantic Ocean is the second 

largest ocean of the Earth, with an area of 82 million km2. Despite this, the knowledge about the 

planktonic communities inhabiting it is limited (Calbet et al, 2009), and for some regions, it simply 

does not exist (McGinty et al, 2011). Specifically on the offshore Portuguese waters, the paucity of 

information is an almost unsurpassable reality. Hitherto, surveys covering Portuguese waters were 

either located on the coastal upwelling zones and estuaries (Continental Shelf) (Queiroga et al., 

2005), or near seamounts (Martin &amp;amp; Christiansen, 2009). Data about the core of the Exclusive 

Economic Zone (EEZ) is particularly missing, a no-data region existing between the coastal area 

and the area covered by the “Plankton Reactivity in the Marine Environment (PRIME) (Gallienne et 

al., 2001) and the “Program Ocean Multidisciplinaire Meso Echelle (POMME)” (Labat et al., 2009) 

long-term monitoring programs.  

The biodiversity of marine ecosystems plays a key role in their structure and function. All 

the levels of biodiversity have a strong influence on marine pelagic ecosystems interactions and 

processes, especially on primary and secondary production, nutrient cycling and trophic transfer 

(Johnson et al., 2011). Zooplankton plays a key role in ecosystem functioning, as they are the 

most important secondary producers in oceans and represent the interface for energy transfer 

between primary producers and planktivores (Suikkanen et al., 2013). Since zooplankton 

constitutes a critical food source for superior trophic levels, like all fish larvae and many 

commercially important planktivorous fish, they are the primal influence on structuring pelagic 

ecosystems (Labat et al., 2009). Zooplankton (along with pelagic nekton) packages planktonic 

primary production into forms available for marine birds and mammals, fishes and humans 

(Johnson et al., 2011). Thus, the need for knowledge on zooplankton has implications for the 

correct management of fish stocks (McGinty et al., 2011) and other activities of economic interest, 

as well as for the understanding of migratory routes taken by threatened cetaceans and their 

feeding patterns (Durbin et al., 2002). 



 19 

Zooplankton also plays other key roles, with even deeper implications, has they concern 

the interactions between climate change and ecosystem function (McGinty et al., 2011). 

Considerable changes in zooplankton phenology have been detected recently, such as increases in 

the proportion of small-sized species and young age classes (Suikkanen et al., 2013). Distribution 

and abundance of zooplankton have also been demonstrating alarming trends. Even though long 

time-series are relatively rare, available data shows that zooplankton exhibits range shifts, in 

response to global warming, that are among the fastest and largest of any marine or terrestrial 

animal group (Richardson, 2008). The general trend, as for land animals, is for zooplanktonic 

organisms to expand their ranges polewards, as temperatures increase. These kinds of shifts in 

distribution have profound effects on community structures and food webs (Beaugrand et al., 

2003). Zooplankton also has an immeasurable influence in oceanic carbon fluxes, as they are one 

of the primary mechanisms for the transfer of carbon from surface waters to the deeper waters 

and sediment (Gallienne et al., 2001).  

One of the major focus of research in previous years in the north-eastern Atlantic (North 

Atlantic Drift Province) has been the distribution and biomass of zooplankton (especially 

mesozooplankton), surveyed in long-term programs such as the “Continuous Plankton Recorder 

(CPR) Survey” (Hays, Clark, Walne, &amp;amp; Warner, 2001), “Plankton Reactivity in the Marine 

Environment (PRIME), “Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT)” (Gallienne et al., 2001), and the 

“Program Ocean Multidisciplinaire Meso Echelle (POMME)” (Labat et al., 2009). Given the 

shortage of information for the Portuguese offshore waters, this study focused on the distribution, 

biodiversity and biomass of zooplankton, namely copepods, as they are the most abundant 

multicellular animals on Earth, even outnumbering insects by possibly three orders of magnitude 

(Schminke, 2006). Our main objectives were a) to find relations between zooplankton and copepod 

distribution and diversity and the latitudinal gradient of the western Iberian margin, as the main 

surrogate for the environmental and spatial factors acting in the region, and b) to establish a 

baseline of knowledge on the zooplankton communities along the latitudinal gradient of the study 

area, to facilitate a better understanding of global patterns of biodiversity and changes in 

community structures.

3.3 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Ethics statement 

No permits were required for the described study, and the study did not involve 

endangered or protected species. 

Study area 

The sampled area, located off the coast of Portugal, was limited between 42º and 35ºN 

and -14º and -9,5ºW, containing coastal, offshore and oceanic waters (Figure 4). Sea floor 

topography is complex and heterogeneous in this area, as it includes the Portuguese continental 

shelf and several seamounts, canyons and plains. The northern section consists of the Vigo and 

Andromeda seamounts, the central of the Carvalho Araújo through, Estremadura spur and Tagus 

basin, and the southern of the Gorringe Ridge (which includes the Ormonde seamount), Ampère 

seamount and the Horseshoe and Ferradura plains, among other minor structures. The most 

relevant structures of the continental shelf are the Nazaré, Setúbal and Lagos canyons and Infante 

D. Henrique hill (Figure 4).  

Sample collection and treatment 

Sampling was conducted on 22 sites, scattered through the study area according to the 

route of the ship of opportunity where it was performed. Pelagic tows were conducted daily before 

sunrise (Cabal, González-Nuevo, &amp;amp; Nogueira, 2008; Sobrinho-Gonçalves &amp;amp; Isidro, 2001), between: 

25th of July and 8th of August; 8th and 11th of August; and 7th and 13th of September. A Bongo 

net with 60 cm of mouth diameter fitted with a 333 ?m mesh size (Martin &amp;amp; Christiansen, 2009) 

was towed from the rear of the ship in a double oblique design (Varela et al., 2010) until a 

maximum depth of 215 m. Tows extended for an average of 20 minutes (including deployment 

and retrieval time), at a velocity between 1,5 and 2 knots (Martin &amp;amp; Christiansen, 2009). Instant 

depth control was carried out with the angle method, and maximum sampling depth and 

temperature at maximum depth (Tdp) were recorded with a Suunto Digital Profundimeter attached 

to the net. Total volume of filtered water was measured with two General Oceanics flowmeters (ref. 

2030R). Sea Surface Temperature (SST) was recorded using a Hobo Tidbit attached to the net. 



 21 

Samples were taken at each of the sampling sites, with the contents of one cod end being 

preserved for taxonomic identification and the other to determine zooplankton biomass. Samples 

for taxonomic identification were preserved in 4% borax-buffered formaldehyde (Gallienne et al., 

2001) and for biomass quantification were filtered on the ship onto pre-ashed and weighted glass-

fiber filters and stored at -20ªC (Gallienne et al., 2001). On return to the laboratory, samples for 

taxonomic identification were microscopically analyzed for total counts and identification of major 

taxonomic groups (MTG, adapted from Suthers &amp;amp; Rissik 2009) and copepod diversity (CD – adult 

copepods were identified to species level, while copepodite stages were identified only to genus 

level and not considered for this work), after splitting in a Folsom Plankton Splitter (1/2 to 1/32 

ratios were used) (Schnack-Schiel et al., 2010). Samples for biomass determination (mg Dry 

Weight m-3) were dried at 60ºC for 48h (Labat et al., 2009).

Environmental data 

Local depth (LD) data were obtained from the GEBCO database (General Bathymetric 

Chart of the Oceans - http://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/online_delivery/gebco/), with a resolution of 

1,6km. Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) was obtained from weekly composites matching the 

sampling period (l3, 4km resolution) of the MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectrometer, 

Aqua satellite) (OceanColor - SeaDAS) (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3). 

Spatial Variables 

Spatial dependence in our study area was modeled using principal coordinates of neighbor 

matrices (PCNM, Borcard &amp;amp; Legendre 2002; Borcard et al. 2004; Dray et al. 2006), a method well 

suited for the detection of spatial trends across a wide range of scales. To start, a Euclidean 

distance matrix among sampling sites was calculated. Then, a truncated connectivity matrix was 

built, using a truncation value that was the largest in the minimum spanning tree linking all the 

sampling sites (Pierre Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre, 1998). A PCoA (principal coordinate analysis) was 

then performed on the truncated connectivity matrix, in order to extract the eigenvalues and 

eigenvectors. The eigenvectors with large eigenvalues correspond to large-scale spatial structures, 

whereas the ones with small eigenvalues describe local spatial structures. All of the PCNM 

eigenvectors are orthogonal and therefore uncorrelated independent variables and were used as 

spatial variables in subsequent analysis. PCNM eigenvectors were created with the package 

“spacemakeR” (Dray et al., 2006) for the R language (R Core Team 2014). 

 

Statistical analyses 

Biomass values were log (x + 0,001) transformed. Independent variables were 

transformed and standardized using a Box-Cox transformation, in order to guarantee normality and 

variance homogeneity, and to avoid scale effects. Both Major Taxonomic Groups (MTG) and 

Copepod Diversity (CD) abundance matrices were transformed using the Hellinger’s distance 

(Pierre Legendre &amp;amp; Gallagher, 2001).  We ran forward selection using a multiple linear regression 

model (P Legendre, 2007) to select the variables, both environmental (Chl a, SST, LD, TDp) and 



 24 

spatial (coordinates; PCNM eigenvectors), which significantly (p &amp;lt;0,05 after 999 random 

permutations) contributed to explain the response in biomass variation (Blanchet, Legendre, &amp;amp; 

Borcard, 2008). We also ran forward selection, this time using canonical redundancy analysis 

(RDA, Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre 1998) to select the variables, environmental and spatial, which 

significantly (p &amp;lt;0,05 after 999 random permutations) contributed to explain the response in MTG 

and CD assemblages. All the sets of variables (environmental, coordinates and PCNM 

eigenvectors) were used in variation partitioning in order to quantify the proportion of the variation 

in biomass, MTG assemblages and CD assemblages, explained by purely environmental, purely 

spatial and spatially structured environmental effects (D Borcard, Legendre, &amp;amp; Drapeau, 1992). 

Partitioning, for MTG and CD assemblages, was done through a series of partial RDA’s (Pierre 

Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre, 1998), and through a series of partial linear regression analyses for 

biomass. The R2 – values were adjusted (R2a) to account for the number of sampling sites and 

explanatory variables (Peres-Neto, Legendre, Dray, &amp;amp; Borcard, 2006). All statistical analyses were 

performed in R statistical language (R Core Team 2014) using the package “vegan” (Oksanen, 

Kindt, Legendre, &amp;amp; O’Hara, 2007) for variation partitioning and for the forward selection of 

explanatory variables. Tests were considered significant when the p-value was less than 0,05.

Zooplankton biomass 

Biomass had an average value of 4,62 mg DW m--3 (SD=4,17) across the sampling sites, 

with the highest value on site 13 and the lowest on site 2 (Table 2). The forward selection 

procedure selected Chl a concentration as a significant predictor of variation in zooplankton 

biomass (R2a = 0,1973), which tends to increase with increasing Chl a concentration. Neither 

latitude nor longitude was selected by the procedure, indicating that none was significant as a 



 26 

predictor of biomass variation.

A total of 15 PCNM eigenvectors were retained for analysis. From these, two were selected 

(PCNM1 and PCNM12) by the forward selection procedure (R2a = 0,4949). The PCNM 

eigenvectors are ordered by decreasing spatial scales (Daniel Borcard et al., 2004; Daniel Borcard 

&amp;amp; Legendre, 2002), therefore, PCNM1 may be interpreted as a broad-scale pattern, while PCNM12 

corresponds to a fine-scale pattern. PCNM1 represents a spatial structure that separates the 

central sites, closer to the shore, from the other sites (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Spatial representation of the selected PCNMs used to build spatial and environmental models 
explaining biomass variation. For the selected PCNMs variables, white circles represent negative scores and 
black circles represent positive scores. 

Variation partitioning revealed that 47,9% of the biomass variation could be explained by 

the environmental and the spatial variables recorded (Figure 6). Most of this variation (28,2%) 

corresponded to purely spatial effects, while 21,3% of the variation was due to the environmental-

spatially structured component. For the pure environmental component we obtained a small 

negative fraction, probably due to suppressive effects, which may be interpreted as null (Peres-

Neto et al., 2006).

MTG and CD assemblages 

We hand-counted and sorted 22 698 individuals in MTG (Supplementary Data – Table 4), 

from which 15 712 were copepods (in both adult and copepodit stages). Average density of 

individuals per site (ind m-3) varied greatly in both MTGs and copepods (Table 3).

In MTG, Copepoda was by far the most dominant group, with an average value of 47,20 

ind m-3, a value extremely close to that of the total individuals, 54,12 ind m-3. Copepods comprised 

more than 87% of the individuals, followed by cladocerans (&gt;3%) and salps+doliolids (&gt;2%), and 

were the only ubiquitous MTG, but other groups like ostracods, cladocerans, appendicularians, 

among others, were also present across the sampling sites. The forward selection procedure 

identified three environmental variables (Figure 7) as significant predictors of variation in MTG 

assemblages: Chl a, SST and LD (R2a = 0,3684). The first axis of the RDA model explains 18,5% of 

the variation and contrasts sites with higher Chl a associated with Hyperidae and Copepoda 

against sites with higher SST, associated with Cladorcerans. The second axis explains 10,4% of the 



 30 

variation and corresponds to a gradient of sea depth (LD), to which are associated 

Salpida+Doliolida and Cnidaria+Ctenophora. Latitude and longitude were also selected by the 

procedure, and explain 31,8% of MTG assemblage variation (R2a = 0,3177).

selected environmental variables (p &amp;lt;0,05). 

A total of 15 PCNM eigenvectors resulted from our spatial model. From these, five were 

selected (PCNM1, PCNM2, PCNM3, PCNM5 and PCNM7) by the forward selection procedure (R2a 

= 0,527). The PCNM eigenvectors are ordered by decreasing spatial scales (Daniel Borcard et al., 

2004; Daniel Borcard &amp;amp; Legendre, 2002), therefore, PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3 may be 

interpreted as broad-scale patterns, while PCNM5 and PCNM7 correspond to medium-scale 



 31 

patterns (Figure 8). PCNM1 represents a spatial structure that separates the central sites, closer to 

the shore, from the other sites, PCNM2 displays a spatial structure that includes the southernmost 

sites, and PCNM3 shows a spatial structure that separates structures in the northernmost part 

nearest to the shore from the other sites.

explaining MTG assemblages’ variation. For the selected PCNMs variables, white circles represent negative 
scores and black circles represent positive scores. 

Variation partitioning revealed that 53,3% of the MTG assemblages’ variation could be explained by 

the environmental and the spatial variables (PCNM’s and coordinates) recorded (Figure 9). Most of 

this variation (26,9%) corresponded to purely spatial effects (PCNM’s and coordinates), 18% of the 

variation was due to the environmental-spatially structured component, and 8,4% was due to the 



 32 

pure environmental component. 

Figure 9. Variation of MTG explained by environmental and spatial variables and their shared effects.  

Abundance of copepods varied among sites, and ranged from 4,12 (site 18) to 203,96 ind 

m-3 (site 14). We found 44 copepod species, divided by 30 genera, 21 families and 4 orders 

(Supplementary Data – Table 5). Dividing by order, Calanoida accounted for 97,2% of total 

abundance, Cyclopoida for 1,35%, Harpacticoida 0,38% and Poecilotomatoida 1,06%. Calanoida 

was the only order represented through all sites, with Calanus being the only ubiquitous genus. 

The dominant species were Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863) (23,19% total abundance), 

Nannocalanus minor (Claus, 1863) (10,42%), Paracalanus parvus (Claus, 1863) (10,62%) and 

Temora stylifera (Dana, 1849) (10,96%). Mean copepod species richness was 16,68 (SD = 4,17), 

ranging from 29 (site 22) to 10 species (site 16). The forward selection procedure identified three 

environmental variables (Figure 10) as significant predictors of variation in copepod assemblages, 

Chl a, SST and LD (R2a = 0,2079). Latitude was also selected by the procedure, as a predictor of 

variation on copepod assemblages (R2a = 0,2078).

A total of 15 PCNM eigenvectors resulted from our spatial model. From these, five were 

selected (PCNM1, PCNM2, PCNM3, PCNM6 and PCNM7) by the forward selection procedure (R2a 

= 0,3944). The PCNM eigenvectors are ordered by decreasing spatial scales (Daniel Borcard et al., 

2004; Daniel Borcard &amp;amp; Legendre, 2002), therefore, PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3 may be 

interpreted as broad-scale patterns, while PCNM5 and PCNM7 correspond to medium-scale 

patterns (Figure 11). PCNM1 represents a spatial structure that separates the central sites closer 

to the shore, from the other sites, PCNM2 displays a spatial structure that includes the 

southernmost sites, and PCNM3 shows a spatial structure that separates a clump of sites in the 

northernmost part nearest to the shore from the other sites.

black circles represent positive scores. 

Variation partitioning revealed that 44,8% of the CD assemblages’ variation could be 

explained by the environmental and the spatial variables (PCNMs and Latitude) recorded (Figure 

12). Most of this variation (24,0%) corresponded to purely spatial effects (PCNM’s and 

coordinates), 18,9% of the variation was due to the environmental-spatially structured component, 

and only 1,9% was due to the purely environmental component. By further dissecting the variation 

explained by the environmental component, either alone or in conjunction with spatial variation 

(20,8%), we found that the unique contribution of LD (8,8%) was the second major contributor to 

variation (Chl a =2,7%; SST=5,4%), and the shared component between SST and Chl a accounted 



 35 

for the major portion of the environmental variation (10,4%). When dissecting the variation 

explained by spatial variables, either alone or in conjunction with the environment (42,9%), we 

found that the unique contribution (15,7%) of the three forward selected PCNM eigenvectors 

accounting for large-scale effects (PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3) was second only to the 

contribution of the shared component between PCNM’s and latitude (16,1%), indicating that the 

major structures defined by those three selected PCNM’s are responsible, either alone or in 

conjunction with another spatial variable (latitude), for the majority of variation that can be 

attributed to spatial effects. Fine-scale PCNM eigenvectors (PCNM6 and PCNM7) only accounted 

for 6,5% of the variation.

3.4 DISCUSSION 

ZOOPLANKTON BIOMASS 

Regarding zooplankton biomass, our average value (4,62 mg DW m-3) is lower than that 

described by Labat et al. (2009) for a nearby western area (average of 9,6 mg DW m-3 in 

September). However, given the fact that biomasses are in the same order of magnitude and are 

also between the interval published by Gallienne et al. (2001) for similar latitudes (3 to 30 mg DW 

m-3), these studies validate our results. The selection of Chl a as a predictor of variation in 

zooplankton biomass, which tends to increase as increases the Chl a concentration, corroborates 

the hypothesis that an increase in zooplankton abundance in the same region would be 

predictable, as energy was transferred up the food chain (Hays et al., 2001). Our spatial model 

also supports this hypothesis, as PCNM1, which was selected by the forward selection procedure, 

represents a spatial structure closer to the shore which intimately resembles the distribution of Chl 

a (Figure 4), and is probably related to distance to shore, acting as a proxy for depth. It is typical 

for shallow shelf areas to show enhancement of primary production and an accompanying 

increase in zooplankton biomass (Kiørboe, Munk, Richardson, Christensen, &amp;amp; Paulsen, 1988). The 

influence of the Nazaré and Setúbal Canyons, two submarine canyons, may also be in effect here, 

since canyons are known for their high primary production (Mendes et al., 2011). Regarding 

PCNM12, it corresponds to a fine-scale pattern that intends to discriminate the selected sites from 

these in their proximity. Unfortunately, lack of data does not allow us to deeply discuss this result, 

which might be related to differences in depth, especially in the sites located near the Nazaré 

Canyon (here, the two selected sites -13 and 14 - present the shortest depth in comparison to 

nearby sites) and the Ormonde Seamount (sites 7 and 8).  The variation partitioning procedure 

revealed that 47,9% of the biomass variation could be explained by the environmental and spatial 

variables recorded. Most of this variation corresponded to purely spatial effects, which is probably 

related to the relationship between distance to shore and depth. Spatial variation and spatially 

structured environmental variation are the main drivers behind the differences in zooplankton 

biomass. Thus, it is possible to conclude that spatial variation - trending towards shallower, near to 

the shore areas (intimately connected to chlorophyll) - is fundamental in determining the 



 37 

distribution of zooplankton in terms of biomass, since that even the Chl a distribution is affected by 

the spatial variation. The coupling of these variables results in what can be described as 

concomitant with coastal upwelling, the oceanic phenomena responsible for areas of high 

productivity near shore, especially for the location and time period of sampling (A. Picado et al., 

2014; Rocha, Cordeiro, Nolasco, &amp;amp; Dubert, 2013). 

 

MTG AND CD ASSEMBLAGES 

MTG assemblages are dominated by copepods, an expected result since these small 

crustaceans are ubiquitous in marine waters, and, according to the literature, may reach values of 

90% of the total abundance in zooplankton (Bonnet et al., 2005; Gallienne et al., 2001; Labat et 

al., 2009). Total abundance of zooplankton in our study was lower than that recorded on other 

studies for nearby areas (POMME 2 and 3 - Labat et al. 2009; PRIME - Gallienne et al. 2001). 

These differences may be due to differences in sampling strategies, or the heterogeneity in space 

and time that oceanic systems traditionally present (Hays et al., 2001; Karouby, Iliadis, Durbec, 

Riandey, &amp;amp; Carlotti, 2007). For MTG assemblages, Chl a, SST and LD were selected as predictors 

of variation by the forward selection procedure, but contrary to the case of biomass, latitude and 

longitude were also selected. These results are explained by the fact that, as opposite to biomass, 

we are now dealing with different taxonomical and functional groups, which have different needs 

and constraints regarding their distribution. The major driver behind this selection is copepod 

(Copepoda) abundance, since they are the most abundant MTG. For our study area, we found that 

copepod abundance (and consequentially, zooplankton) is majorly influenced by high 

concentrations of Chl a and low SST, results in accordance to the literature (McGinty et al., 2011) 

but that may show a bias to the high abundance of copepods on the central, near-shore sites 

(sampled during the upwelling period). Increase in latitude was also selected by the procedure as a 

major driver in copepod distribution, but this result is probably related to the fact that the sites with 

higher abundance of copepods are located in the central area of our study, thus causing the 

existence of a latitudinal gradient that runs from the southernmost sites to the center of the study 

area.  Contrarily to copepods, cladocerans abundance is conditioned by higher SST, which, 



 38 

accordingly to their preference for temperate and warm waters, especially during summer months 

(Atienza, Saiz, Skovgaard, Trepat, &amp;amp; Calbet, 2008; Johns, Edwards, Greve, &amp;amp; SJohn, 2005; 

Mollmann, Koster, Kornilovs, &amp;amp; Sidrevics, 2002), was an expected result. Cladocerans show a 

clear preference for southern zones on our study area, as demonstrated by abundance peaks in 

sites 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (Supplementary Data – Table 4). Another result of the procedure is that 

the abundance of the group Salpida+Doliolida (salps and doliolids) is associated with higher values 

of LD and increasing longitude. PCNM1 represents a spatial structure closer to the shore, which 

intimately resembles the distribution of Chl a (Figure 4), and has the highest values of abundance. 

This result is similar to that of biomass, and, as discussed above, is probably related to distance to 

shore. The sites selected for PCNM1 display high abundances, especially copepods. Since 

copepods are usually accountable for the majority of the biomass in zooplankton (Gallienne et al. 

2001; Labat et al. 2009; Bonnet et al. 2005; our results), it is suitable that the influence of 

canyons and coastal upwelling, for reasons already discussed, may be responsible for this result. 

PCNM2 represents a cluster of sites showing a clear separation between north and south. Looking 

deeper into the MTG data we found that at least 70% of the abundance of ostracods, cladocerans, 

polychaeta larvae, chaetognaths and pteropods is concentrated on these sites. These sites show 

high LD (with the exception of site 6, one of the less significant) and high SST, implying that the 

referred MTGs, in our study area, display a preference for warmer, deeper oceanic waters. The 

variation partitioning procedure for MTGs revealed that 53,3% of variation in the composition of the 

groups could be explained by the environmental and spatial variables recorded. As in the case of 

biomass, the procedure revealed that MTG composition patterns were mainly determined by purely 

spatial variation (26,9%), which, again, is probably related to the relationship between distance to 

shore and depth. In addition to the spatial component, the shared environment-space component 

accounted for a significant part of variation in MTG composition (18%). The purely environmental 

component had a positive score of 8,4% (Chl a+LD+SST), showing that these environmental 

variables, by themselves, show some weight in shaping the composition of the different MTG. A 

relatively high proportion of the variation (46,7%) in MTG composition was undetermined, which is 

partly due to the fact that marine systems are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in 

space and time (Hays et al., 2001; Karouby et al., 2007) - and the sampling we performed 

provides only a snapshot of the communities - but it probably also includes variation caused by 



 39 

unmeasured environmental variables. 

Regarding copepod assemblages (CD), these were dominated by the genus Calanus, 

represented by Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863). This species, typical of a pseudo-oceanic 

temperate species association (Beaugrand et al., 2002), usually shows a higher abundance along 

shelf-edges, which is in accordance with the high abundance values we found for sites 11 and 14.  

According to the forward selection procedure, Chl a, SST, LD and longitude are significant 

predictors of variation on copepod assemblages. Analyzing Figure 10, the most striking features 

are the association of Candacia simplex with increasing SST, Calanus heldolandicus with higher 

values of LD and, on the other end of the axis, Candacia armata, associated with lower values of 

LD. For C. armata this result matches with its ecological characteristics, since this species 

abundance is typically related to shelf edges, areas of lower depth than oceanic areas (Beaugrand 

et al., 2002). Regarding C. helgolandicus, this result is probably more related to its ubiquitous 

distribution, this way showing a bias to deeper waters, although high abundance values were 

indeed recorded for areas with great depth (sites 8 an 9, located near the Ormonde seamount). C. 

simplex also had its abundance peaks in sites 8 and 9, but this preference for warmer waters is 

not described in the literature. Latitude was also selected by the procedure, indicating that only 

latitude, not longitude, was significant as a predictor of variation on copepod assemblages (R2a = 

0,2078). This result may be indicative of the existence of a latitudinal gradient.  When conjugating 

this result with our spatial model, PCNM2 is in agreement with this result. If PCNM1 shows a 

cluster of sites in the central area of the map, PCNM2 displays a clear separation between north 

and south sites, and PCNM3 a cluster of northern, nearer to shore sites. This means that there are 

broad-scale spatial gradients in action (Latitude+PCNM1-3), and inside these gradients fine-scale 

variation is also present (PCNM6,7). When we look into copepod assemblage data, it is possible to 

offer hypothesis on the clustering present in PCNM1, PCNM2 and PCNM3. PCNM1 clusters sites 

near to the shore, in the upwelling zone, and these sites show high abundances of species that 

typically prefer phytoplankton rich waters, like Calanoides carinatus (Kroyer, 1849), C. 

helgolandicus and Oncaea media (Giesbrecht, 1891), and species that prefer coastal waters, like 

Euterpina acutifrons (Dana, 1847) and Ditrichocorycaeus anglicus (Lubbock, 1857) (Cabal et al., 

2008). PCNM2 divides sites between north and south, and this division is probably related to 



 40 

warmer waters, an hypothesis reinforced by the presence of T. stylifera, a species typical of 

subtropical and Mediterranean waters (Cabal et al., 2008). PCNM3 aggregated sites that display 

high relative abundances (dominant species in sites 2, 15 and 17) of Centropages typicus (Krøyer, 

1849), Paracalanus parvus (Claus, 1863) and Nannocalanus minor (Claus, 1863), species that 

display a neritic character, although they also appear in oceanic waters (Vives &amp;amp; Shmeleva, 2006), 

and this may be a signal of the influence of depth.  Medium and fine-scale PCNM’s represent 

spatial variation, but the data available does not allow the presentation of hypothesis.  

We focused on investigating the determinants of beta diversity patterns in our study area 

by partitioning the variation of copepod assemblages’ composition between environmental and 

spatial factors. A considerable proportion of the variation (44,8%) of copepod assemblage 

composition was determined by environmental (Chl a, LD, SST) and spatial variables (PCNM 1, 

2,3,6,7 and Latitude). Almost all of this variation (42,9%) is due to spatial variation (environmental 

structured plus the spatial component alone) and the contribution of pure environmental effects 

was negligible (1,9%). Regarding the environmental variation (alone and spatially structured), it is 

possible to detect a synergistic effect between Chl a and SST that is responsible for 18,5% of 

variation. This result is on agreement with the hypothesis that SST is one of the major drivers of 

variation in copepod community structure (Beaugrand et al., 2002; Suikkanen et al., 2013). 

Despite this, for our study area we discovered that spatial variation is the major driver. Spatial 

variation, namely large-scale (PCNM1-3) effects and latitude are responsible for 35,2% of variation. 

This result is in agreement with the findings of McGinty et al. (2011), who stated that local 

conditions are important and that inter-regional variability is not simply a reflection of 

environmental forcing correlated with SST. The elevated percentages of unexplained variation 

(52,1% on biomass; 46,7% on MTG; 55,2% on copepod beta-diversity) suggest some caution when 

reading into the results, but this only states the importance of continuing this type of studies, in 

order to suppress the paucity of information on the theme. Non-measured variables, like salinity 

and oxygen, and a stronger interpretation of oceanographic phenomena are also probably lacking 

from our study. 

 



 41 

In conclusion, our study showed that spatial effects were the primary drivers of variation 

on zooplankton biomass, MTG assemblages’ composition and copepod beta-diversity. Spatially 

structured environmental variation also had an important role. Zooplankton biomass showed the 

greatest dependence on spatial effects (along with spatially structured environmental variation), 

showing that biomass alone might not be so susceptible to occasional changes in the 

environmental variables. MTG composition and copepod beta-diversity showed more complex 

patterns of variation, but the predominance of spatial effects is a result that, although contrary to 

the general trend (Beaugrand et al., 2002; Suikkanen et al., 2013), is in accordance with the 

hypothesis that inter-regional variability is more complex than a correlation with SST (McGinty et 

al., 2011). Finally, establishment of baseline data for our study area for the studied parameters 

(especially copepod richness) is also a valuable contribution that this study provides for the 

scientific and managing community.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 

The major point of this thesis is that, for our study area, spatial variation is the primary 

driver of variation on zooplankton biomass, MTG assemblages’ composition and copepod beta-

diversity. However, the elevated percentages of unexplained variation (52,1% on biomass; 46,7% 

on MTG; 55,2% on copepod beta-diversity) suggest some caution when reading into the results, but 

this only states the importance of continuing this type of studies, in order to suppress the paucity 

of information on the theme. The census performed in this study provides data on species richness 

and diversity for areas where, before, data was lacking or was severely incomplete. 

Annual repetition of this kind of campaigns should be a focus of monitoring programs, but 

since these are lacking for the studied area, a monitoring procedure will be outlined in the 

following areas, functioning as an idea for the future. After experimenting sampling with a towable 

net (a bongo net), a simpler, more effective method could be the use of a Optical Plankton Counter 

(OPC) (Gallienne et al., 2001). The OPC, although a considerable investment, provides huge 

amounts of data, since it can be constantly sampling water (superficial and deep). Vertical net 

samples would be needed for calibration of the device, taxonomical characterization and biomass 

determination. Sampling of water for determination of chlorophyll (or phytoplankton) content, 

temperature, salinity and oxygen would provide a great set of environmental data. When sampling 

with the vertical net, the use of a CTD would also be useful to gather a picture of the thermocline 

in the study area. Sampling could be conducted using line transects, starting at the inner limit of 

the continental shelf and finishing at the 13ºW (similar to our study). Line transects could be 

parallel to the equator, starting at 42ºN and finishing at 34ºN, with 2º between them, in order to 

encompass all our study area. If possible, sampling a larger area would also be a great project.
