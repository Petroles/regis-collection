Abstract 
 

Biocompatibility, described as the ability of a material to fulfil an appropriate response in a 

given application with the minimum of allergic, inflammatory or toxic reactions when in 

contact with tissues, is one of the most important characteristic of the materials used in tissue 

engineering and dentistry.  

Tissue engineering is a scientific area in continuous expansion. The developments achieved in 

this area, have significantly contributed for many advances in the field of regenerative 

medicine. This interdisciplinary science combines the knowledge and experience of several 

different fields, from materials science to biology, in order to develop synthetic substitutes for 

human tissues. Aiming at this goal, the most common approach used nowadays involves the 

seeding of tridimensional porous structures (scaffolds), biocompatible/biodegradable, with 

donor cells to promote tissue regeneration. This process comprises at least three different 

stages: the production of the 3D structures, sterilization and cell seeding into scaffolds, and 

finally the cell culture of the set cell-scaffold. 

On the other hand, dentistry has currently registered an increasing importance, namely in the 

endodontic field. Consequently, the development of biocompatible endodontic cements has 

become of high importance, since these materials can be in direct contact with different cell 

types, mainly if extrusion of the material to the periapical tissues occurs. There are a variety of 

commercial root canal cements available, based in different formulations, whose 

biocompatibility has been studied in vitro and in vivo over the years. However, all the 

endodontic cements commercially available show some degree of cytotoxicity. Thus, new 

endodontic cements are emerging, allowing the development of new approaches.  

Throughout this work it was intended to evaluate the cytotoxicity of two different types of 

materials: scaffolds and endodontic cements, the latter also called filling cements. Thus, the 

first goal aimed to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of pure PCL scaffolds and PCL-HA 

composite scaffolds. For this purpose, scaffolds were produced with different percentages of 

HA (10% and 25% per weight), and also with different types of HA: synthetic and natural HA 

(HA S and HA N, respectively).  Scaffolds were produced by bioextrusion, a technique 

controlled by a computer, with different architectural characteristics (300 µm of filament

thickness, 300 and 600 µm of pore size and geometries of 0/90º e 0/45º). The second goal of 

this work aimed to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity regarding three different endodontic 

cements: an epoxy-resin, AH Plus JetTM, and two based-silicone cements, GuttaFlow®2 and an 

improved version of the latter material, that is not yet on the market, and thus it will be called 

“improved” Guttaflow® throughout this work. In order to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of 

these materials, different volumes of material (0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mL) and different incubation 

times (72 and 120 hours) were used. The in vivo cytotoxicity of these materials was also 

evaluated in a subcutaneous implantation model. Thus, the endodontic cements were placed 

inside tubes with 8 mm of length, obtained by section of 18 GA (1.3 mm ? 48 mm) abocats, 

which were implanted into three quadrants of the dorsum of Wistar rats. The possible reactions 

of the tissues were evaluated 8 and 30 days after implantation. As control, the reactions induced 

by abocat tubes without any material inside, were compared during the same time periods (first 

quadrant). 

The cytotoxicity assay selected for this work, in order to reach both main goals, was the 3-(4,5-

dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which is based upon the 

ability of the dehydrogenase enzyme (present in metabolically active cells), to cleave the 

tetrazolium ring of MTT and convert the yellow water-soluble tetrazolium salt into dark-

blue/purple formazan crystals. In both cases (studies performed with scaffolds and endodontic 

cements), the MTT assay was done with macrophages, fibroblasts and co-culture of 

macrophages and fibroblasts.  

Regarding the evaluated scaffolds, it was concluded that PCL-HA N composite scaffolds are 

the ones presenting better in vitro biologic behavior (less cytotoxic). The obtained results also 

indicate that the scaffolds’ architecture has a leading role in cell-scaffold interaction. Scaffolds 

with pores of 300 µm and geometry 0/45º show less cytotoxicity, which, in the present study, 

means that they promote a higher cellular adhesion and proliferation. In what concerns the 

endodontic cements, the performed in vitro studies allow to conclude that the “improved” 

GuttaFlow® is the least cytotoxic of the three tested materials, therefore it is the one presenting 

greater biocompatibility.  

Key-words: Biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, tissue engineering, endodontics, scaffolds, 

endodontic cements.

Resumo 
 

A biocompatibilidade descrita como a capacidade de um material para desempenhar uma 

resposta apropriada numa determinada aplicação com o minimo de reacções alérgicas, 

inflamatórias ou tóxicas quando em contacto com tecidos, é uma das características mais 

importantes dos materiais utilizados em Engenharia de Tecidos e em Medicina Dentária.  

A Engenharia de Tecidos é uma área científica em contínua expansão. Os 

desenvolvimentos conseguidos por esta área têm contribuído significativamente para diversos 

avanços no campo da Medicina Regenerativa, ciência que combina conhecimentos de áreas tão 

distintas como a Engenharia de Materiais e a Biologia, com o objectivo de desenvolver substitutos 

sintéticos para os tecidos humanos. Para se atingir este objectivo, a metodologia mais utilizada 

actualmente envolve o uso de estruturas porosas tridimensionais (scaffolds), biocompatíveis e 

biodegradáveis, em conjugação com células, de forma a promover a regeneração de tecidos. Este 

processo compreende no mínimo três fases distintas: a produção das estruturas 3D, esterilização e 

deposição celular nos scaffolds e por último, cultura celular do conjunto scaffolds-células. 

Por sua vez, a Medicina Dentária tem registado actualmente uma crescente importância, 

nomeadamente na área de endodoncia. Consequentemente, o desenvolvimento de cimentos de 

obturação endodônticos biocompativeis, tornou-se de extrema importância, uma vez que estes 

poderão contactar directamente com diversos tipos de células, principalmente se ocorrer extrusão 

do material para os tecidos periapicais. Estão disponíveis comercialmente inúmeros cimentos de 

obturação, com diferentes formulações, cuja biocompatibilidade tem sido estudada in vitro e in 

vivo ao longo dos últimos anos. Contudo, todos os cimentos endodônticos disponíveis 

comercialmente mostram algum nível de citotoxicidade. Por este motivo, têm surgido novos 

cimentos de obturação, os quais têm permitido desenvolver novas abordagens.  

Neste sentido, ao longo deste trabalho pretendeu-se avaliar a citotoxicidade de dois tipos 

diferentes de materiais: scaffolds e cimentos endodônticos, estes últimos também designados de 

cimentos de obturação. Assim, o primeiro objectivo deste trabalho pretendia avaliar a 

citotoxicidade in vitro de scaffolds de PCL e scaffolds constituídos por PCL/HA. Para tal 

fabricaram-se  scaffolds não só com diferentes teores de HA (10% e 25% de HA), mas também 

abragendo diferentes tipos de  HA: sintética e natural. Os scaffolds foram fabricados pela técnica 

de bioextrusão controlada por computador, com diferentes características arquitectónicas (300 µm 

de espessura do filamento, 300 e 600 µm de tamanho de poros e geometrias 0/90º e 0/45º). O

segundo objectivo deste projecto pretendia avaliar a citotoxicidade in vitro de três diferentes 

cimentos de obturação: uma resina epoxy, AH Plus JetTM, e dois cimentos tendo por base silicone, 

GuttaFlow®2 e uma versão melhorada deste último  material, o qual por ainda não se encontrar no 

mercado, será ao longo do trabalho designado por “improved” GuttaFlow®.  De modo a avaliar a 

citotoxicidade in vitro destes materiais, utilizaram-se diferentes volumes de material (0,01; 0,02 e 

0,03 mL) e também diferentes tempos de incubação, 72 e 120 horas. Avaliou-se igualmente a 

citotoxicidade in vivo destes materiais em modelos de implantação subcutânea. Para tal, os 

cimentos de obturação foram colocados em tubos de 8 mm de comprimento, obtidos por secção de 

abocats 18 GA (1,3 mm ? 48 mm), os quais foram implantados nos quatro quadrantes do dorso de 

ratos Wistar. Foram avaliadas as possíveis reacções dos tecidos aos 8 e 30 dias após a implantação 

e comparadas com as reacções induzidas com tubos de abocat sem material, nos mesmos períodos 

(grupos de controlo).   

O teste de citotoxicidade efectuado in vitro, com vista a atingir ambos os objectivos 

referidos, foi o teste do brometo de 3-(4,5-dimetiltiazol2-il)-2,5-difeniltetrazólio (MTT), o qual se 

baseia na capacidade da enzima desidrogenase, presente em células metabolicamente activas, 

clivar os anéis tetrazólio do MTT e formar cristais formazano de cor violeta. Em ambos os casos 

(estudo efectuado com os scaffolds e estudo com os cimentos endodônticos), o teste de MTT foi 

realizado com macrófagos, fibroblastos e co-cultura de macrófagos e fibroblastos.  

Nas condições deste estudo, relativamente aos scaffolds avaliados, concluiu-se que os 

scaffolds constituídos por PCL/HA natural são os que apresentam melhor comportamento 

biológico in vitro (menor citotoxicidade). Os resultados obtidos permitiram, ainda, verificar que a 

arquitectura dos scaffolds desempenha um papel preponderante na interacção entre as células e os 

scaffolds. Scaffolds com poros de 300 µm e geometria 0/45º mostraram ser menos citotóxicos, o 

que, no presente estudo, significa que promoveram uma maior adesão e proliferação celular. No 

que respeita aos cimentos endodônticos, os estudos efectuados in vitro permitiram concluir que o 

“improved” GuttaFlow® é o menos citotóxico dos três materiais avaliados, sendo portanto o que 

apresenta maior biocompatibilidade.

General Introduction 
 

1.1  Introduction 
 

In 1987, a biomaterial was defined as “a nonviable material used in a medical device, intended 

to interact with biological systems”. An important characteristic of a biomaterial is its 

biocompatibility that can be described as “the ability to perform with an appropriate host 

response in a specific application”. Thus, biocompatibility occurs when tissues come in 

contact with a particular material and do not show any toxic, irritating, inflammatory or allergic 

experience, or mutagenic or carcinogenic background. For a material to be biocompatible an 

appropriate host response is required, which means non-occurrence of adverse reactions of the 

organism face to the material. Therefore, biocompatibility is an essential requirement of 

biomaterials. Another important characteristic of biomaterials is non-cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity 

is the quality of being toxic to cells. If materials are not biocompatible and if they show a 

cytotoxic effect, an adverse reaction of the organism and consequently the rejection of the 

material by the body can occur.   

These properties are of utmost importance in many fields, namely in Tissue Engineering and 

Dentistry.  

Tissue Engineering offers the possibility to help in the regeneration of tissues and, in some 

cases, to create new tissues and replace failing or malfunctioning organs. This is achieved 

through the use of degradable biomaterials to either induce surrounding tissue or cell ingrowth 

or to serve as temporary scaffold for transplanted cells to attach, grow and maintain 

differentiate functions. 

Endodontics has recently assumed a crescent importance in the panorama of dentistry. The 

main goal of endodontic treatment is the complete tooth restoration, while trying to keep the 

natural tooth when possible. 



Chapter 1 – General Introduction

Thus, the main objective of the present work is to study the cytotoxicity of two different 

materials: a 3D scaffold composed of poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HA), 

that will be used in Tissue Engineering, and an endodontic sealer whose performance is to be 

compared with similar commercial products. Both, scaffolds and endodontic sealers tested in 

this work have, as final goal, an application in dentistry, specifically, scaffolds in bone tissue 

regeneration of the oral cavity (mandible and/or maxillary) and endodontic sealers in 

endodontic treatment.   

In what concerns the tested scaffolds, it is intended to study the influence that the addition of 

hydroxyapatite (HA) to poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) has on their interaction with cells and 

consequently in their cytotoxicity behavior. Thus, in the present work, scaffolds of pure PCL 

and also composite scaffolds of PCL-HA were studied.  Additionally, it is intended to test two 

different percentages and types of HA, natural and synthetic HA, and to compare their 

performance. Besides that, these scaffolds were fabricated with different architectures, namely 

pore size and geometry, in order to analyze its influence in scaffolds’ cytotoxicity.  

Regarding the endodontic materials, they should be non-toxic, biocompatible and able to seal 

completely the root canal system in three dimensions. Among the various types of sealers, the 

endodontic cements will be the ones subjected to investigation in the present work. A new 

cement (“improved” GuttaFlow®), not yet on the market, will be compared with two 

commercial products (AH Plus JetTM and GuttaFlow®2). 

The biological performance of these two distinct materials (scaffolds and endodontic cements) 

will be investigated by in vitro cytotoxicity assays, specifically MTT assays, using 

macrophages, fibroblasts and their co-culture. Besides that, in order to prove the 

biocompatibility of AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow®2 and of the “improved” GuttaFlow®, the in 

vivo biocompatibility of these materials, through subcutaneous implants, will also be evaluated.

  Chapter 2 

Literature review 
 

Since in this work two different materials with different applications will be studied, several 

themes will be addressed in order to facilitate the understanding of the work, in the present 

chapter.  

Initially, a literature review on tissue regeneration (TE) based upon the use of scaffolds will 

be done. Special attention will be devoted to scaffolds’ requirements, biomaterials and 

production, as well as characterization technologies.  

Afterwards, to address the second material in study, an endodontic cement, which is used 

in root canal treatment, a literature review on dental anatomy and root canal treatment is 

presented. At this point, emphasis will be put on different types of commercially available 

endodontic materials.  

 

2.1  Scaffolds for tissue engineering  

 

2.1.1  Concepts of tissue engineering and its utility  

The failure of organs and tissues as a result of injury is currently one of the major health 

problems. Treatments encompass, in most cases, transplants, surgical repair, placement of 

artificial prosthesis and mechanical devices. However, these procedures often involve the 

risk of immune rejection and require invasive therapies, causing discomfort to the patient, 

increasing time of convalescence and decreasing his quality of life. 

In the last decades, there has been a significant development of some areas of tissue 

engineering (TE), aimed to produce biological substitutes able to repair, replace or 

regenerate organs and tissues more effectively than conventional therapies [1-2]. 

TE comprises three main groups of approach strategies for tissue regeneration [2-5]: 

 

? the use of isolated cells or cell substitutes. This strategy comprises the direct in vivo 

implantation of isolated cells or cell substitutes. It avoids possible complications associated 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

6 

with surgery. However, there is a possibility of immunological rejection or loss of cell 

function after implantation; 

 

? the use of growth factors. The success of this strategy, as the denomination indicates, 

depends on the behavior of growth factors and controlled released systems. Growth factors 

are signaling molecules regulating several cellular functions, such as proliferation, 

differentiation, migration, adhesion and gene expression; 

 

? the use of scaffolds. This strategy is based on a temporary scaffold which provides 

both a substrate for the implanted cells and a physic support for the formation of new tissue. 

The transplanted cells will adhere to the scaffold, proliferate, secrete their own extracellular 

matrices and stimulate new tissue formation. During this process the scaffold will be 

degrading until it is eliminated by the body.  

 

The last strategy is the most used in TE since it allows the experimental manipulation at 

three different levels: cells, materials and technologies for scaffolds’ production. The cells 

used in this strategy are harvested from living tissues removed from the own patient 

(autogenic) or from another person (allogenic), deposited in 3D scaffolds and cultured in 

vitro in order to obtain a biological implant for transplantation. This strategy can be applied 

with several variations that rely on the origin of the cells, on scaffold’s biomaterial, the 

conditions and duration of cell culture, and also on the type and properties of the tissue to 

regenerate. 

 

Scaffolds 

Scaffolds are 3D matrix structures, with high degree of porosity, which act as temporary 

supports for the cells, enabling regeneration of target tissues [1]. They act as a reservoir of 

ions, water, nutrients, cytokines and growth factors. Therefore, a scaffold can be considered 

an artificial substitute of natural extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as of the mineralized 

phase, promoting activity, which leads to bone growth, until its regeneration is complete 

[4,6-7]. They also support the vascularization of the newly formed tissue. They can actively 

participate in the regenerative process through the release of growth and/or differentiation 

factors, present in their tridimensional structure [4,6]. Thus, it can be assumed that a scaffold 

with the appropriated properties is an essential component for TE strategies, since its 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

7 

properties affect not only cell survival, signaling, growth, propagation and reorganization, 

but also their gene expression and the preservation (or not) of their phenotype.  

The criteria that defines a good scaffold for TE include having the adequate materials with 

suitable internal architecture, surface properties and sufficient mechanical properties that 

match the host tissue, including elastic modulus, compressive strength and fatigue 

resistance [1]. The bone biomechanical system is very complex, thus there is not yet a 

consensus on how to produce an ideal scaffold. However, the following properties have 

been defined has being essential: 

 

? biocompatibility: one of the primary requirements of any scaffold. The 

biocompatibility of a scaffold is described as its capacity to support normal cellular activity, 

including molecular signaling without inducing systematic toxic effects to the host tissue 

and immunological reactions [5, 8-9]. The implantation of a scaffold can initiate a series of 

events in the organism being an answer to the presence of a foreign body. The typical initial 

inflammation can, in some cases, lead to a chronic inflammation, which may promote the 

development of a fibrous capsule and consequent failure of the implant [10]. The degree of 

biocompatibility of a material can be measured by the level of deviation from a normal 

process of tissue regeneration [11]; 

 

? osteoinductivity: an ideal scaffold should be osteoconductive, allowing adhesion, 

cell proliferation and differentiation in the host tissue [6, 8-9]. The scaffold should induce 

bone formation through biomolecular signaling and stem cells recruitment. Moreover, an 

ideal scaffold need to let form blood vessels around or inside the implant in just a few 

weeks of implantation, aiming to help the supply of nutrients, oxygen and removal of waste 

products [9]; 

 

? biodegradability: the scaffold material should degrade into biodegradable 

metabolites and be excreted, or reused in tissue remodeling process. The scaffold 

degradation rate should be inversely proportional to the rate of tissue regeneration, in such 

a way that by the time the injury site is totally regenerated the scaffold is totally degraded 

[3,6,8,12];  

? appropriate surface chemistry for cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation: 

since adhesion is a pre-requisite for future cellular functions, the different types of cells 

require the presence of a suitable substrate to retain their ability to proliferate and perform 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

8 

differentiated functions [12]. Therefore, the surface characteristics of materials, (such as 

their topography, chemistry, surface energy and wettability) play a key role in cell adhesion 

to biomaterials [14]. Nevertheless, it is very rare that a material with good bulk properties 

also possesses the required surface characteristics. This is why surface modification is 

essential for most of the scaffolds used for medical applications [15]; 

 

? porosity and pore size: porosity is defined as the percentage of empty spaces within 

a solid body and it is independent of the material [16]. It is necessary for in vivo bone tissue 

growth to allow migration and proliferation of osteoblasts and mesenchymal cells, as well 

as matrix deposition. Generally, the required porosity is around 90% with a pore size 

between 20 and 250 µm. Pore size of 20 µm has been reported for fibroblast ingrowth, from 

20 to 125 µm for regeneration of adult skin and 100-250 µm for bone regeneration [3]. 

Recent studies indicate that a high number of pores, combining micro and macroporous 

structures, allows the improvement of vascularization, comparatively with macroporous 

scaffolds, since an interconnected pore network structure enhances the diffusion rates to 

and from the center of the scaffold and facilitates vascularization thus improving oxygen 

and nutrient supply and waste removal [13]. However, porosity decreases with the 

mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, increasing the difficulty of scaffolds 

manufacturing. Small diameter pores are preferable to provide a high surface-volume rate; 

 

? mechanical and physical properties: scaffolds should have sufficient mechanical 

strength to withstand hydrostatic pressure and tensions in host tissue, enabling a good 

coupling between the scaffold and the host tissue, and allowing cell adhesion and cell 

proliferation. The chemical and topographic properties of the surface, can affect cell 

adhesion and proliferation. The chemical properties are related with the ability of cells to 

adhere to the material, and also with the interaction between proteins and the material. The 

topographic properties are of particular interest regarding the osteoconductive activity 

(process through which osteogenic cells migrate to the surface of the scaffold after the 

implantation of the material) [6]. The mechanical properties of bone vary from cancellous 

to cortical bone. Young’s modulus of cortical bone is between 15 and 20 GPa, whereas for 

cancellous bone is between 0.1 and 2 GPa. Compressive strength varies between 100 and 

200 MPa for cortical bone and between 2 and 20 MPa for cancellous bone [9]. 

The wide variation in mechanical properties and pore geometry makes it difficult to design 

an ideal bone scaffold.

Table 1 shows the relationship between some scaffold characteristics and their 

corresponding biological effects. 

 

TE strategies based on scaffolds are very dependent on the selected material and of the 

technological process used for its production. Nowadays, four different classes of materials 

have been used in TE area: polymeric materials of natural origin (e.g. collagen), polymeric 

materials of synthetic origin (e.g. polyglicolic acid (PGA), polylactide acid (PLA) and 

poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL)), metals (e.g. Magnesium) and ceramic materials (e.g. 

hydroxyapatite (HA)).  

 

2.1.2  Biomaterials for scaffolds production

steps of TE. In general, the scaffold should be made from a highly biocompatible material

which does not have the potential to initiate an immunological or clinically detectable 

foreign bone reaction [17].    

Over the last century, there has been a great increase in the use of biomaterials such as 

biocompatible metals, ceramics and polymers for surgical purposes. Metals and ceramics 

are mainly use in orthopedics. However, these materials are not biodegradable and their 

processability is very limited. Thus, polymer materials have received special attention and 

have been widely used in tissue engineering, due to an easy control over biodegradability 

and processability [18]. 

 

2.1.2.1  Metals 

Metals, such as stainless steel and titanium, are biocompatible, exhibit high compressive 

strengths, are easy to shape and relatively inexpensive. However, they show some 

disadvantages: they are not biodegradable, they are stiff and there is the possibility of metal 

ions release [8-9]. Moreover, they have a high Young’s modulus, which induces stress 

shielding that can protect the native bone tissue from mechanical stimulation. Mechanical 

stimulation is an important initiator of differentiation and activation of osteoblasts. Thence, 

metallic materials are used for scaffolds production in a limited number of situations, for 

example in spine surgery and also to coat the surface of prosthetic implants to promote 

bone ingrowth and secondary implant stability [19].  

In the last years, a biodegradable scaffold material made from magnesium alloys has been 

developed. This material allows an increasing of the rate of bone formation and a suitable 

degradation rate. The osteoinductive properties of this material are based on the corrosion 

product magnesium hydroxide, which can temporarily enhance osteoblast activity and 

decrease the number of osteoclasts [8]. 

 

2.1.2.2  Ceramics 

A ceramic is a material made from an inorganic, non-metallic material with a crystalline 

structure [19]. Ceramic materials have been widely used in biomedical engineering and in 

bone regeneration/substitution, mainly due to the ability of being osteoconductive and 

osteoinductive. They are mono or poly-crystalline biocompatible materials that show 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

11 

strong chemical bonds among constitutive atoms, correlated with a high hardness and high 

melting temperature. 

The major disadvantages of these materials are brittleness and low mechanical stability [4,6], 

which prevent their use in situations of regeneration of large bone defects. Moreover, they 

are usually difficult to process into porous structures with complex shapes [4]. Furthermore, 

due to in vivo features, like osteoclastic activity, their degradation/ dissolution rates are 

difficult to predict. This could be a problem, since a fast degradation will compromise the 

mechanical stability of the system, which is low by itself [6].  

The most common ceramic material used to build scaffolds is calcium phosphate (CaP). 

CaP is an ideal candidate to produce matrices as it mimics the inorganic component of bone 

- calcium hydroxyapatite [19]. However, a too fast degradation of scaffolds made from CaP 

would lead to an increase of the extracellular concentration of Ca and P, which can cause 

cellular death [6]. Their physical properties including stability, their degradation rate and 

processability can be modified in a particular range by using different compositions. These 

materials are known to have an excellent biocompatibility and are bioactive, as they 

connect to bone, allowing an increase of bone tissue formation [8].  

 

2.1.2.3  Polymers 

Polymeric materials, for TE applications, should be biocompatible, biodegradable and easy 

to process. In vivo, polymers degrade mainly due to chemical reactions like hydrolysis. 

However, some polymers, especially natural polymers and their derivatives, are also 

susceptible to enzymatic degradation. The degradation rate of these materials can be 

modified based upon copolymerization and changes in its hydrophobicity and crystalline 

structure. Degradation reactions are not limited to the material surface, but can also occur 

for some polymers in the whole volume of the scaffold (BULK-degradation), due to the 

fast diffusion of water into the material [8].  

The ideal polymer for TE applications should have the following properties [20-21]: 

? should not induce an inflammatory response; 

? must be metabolized in the body after finishing its purpose without a trace; 

? should be easily processed into the final product form and easily sterilized. 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

12 

These materials can be divided in two different types: natural biodegradable polymers 

and synthetic biodegradable polymers. Natural polymers are usually biocompatible, 

whereas synthetic polymers can contain a residue of initiators and other impurities that do 

not allow cell adhesion and growth. On the other hand synthetic polymers have better 

mechanical properties and thermal stability than several natural polymers [22].  

Some examples of natural polymers are alginate, collagen and chitosan which promote a 

higher cell growth since they have a similar structure to the extracellular matrix of the tissue 

to regenerate. However, their regeneration rate cannot be controlled hindering their use.  

Among synthetic polymers the most frequently used are polyglycolic acid (PGA), 

polylactic acid (PLA), and their copolymer PLGA, which obtained approval from the US 

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in sutures and some implantable 

devices. The natural polymers are obtained, as their name implies, from natural animal and 

vegetal sources, and have as their main advantage a low immunogenic potential, the ability 

to interact with the host tissues and a high chemical versatility. Besides, their use in TE is 

especially attractive due to their ability to be remodelled in vivo [8,18].  

 

2.1.2.4  Composites 

To overcome the limitations associated to individual biomaterials, the combination of 

materials with different characteristics has been studied in order to produce scaffolds.  By 

selecting the right combination of materials, this strategy allows the adjustment of the 

mechanical properties, degradation and absorption rates and biocompatibility of the 

produced scaffolds. The degradation rates of the composites can be optimized by adjusting 

the composition and molecular weights of the polymers, in such a way that the degradation 

rate is complementary to the new bone formation rate [23]. 

For bone tissue regeneration, the combination of organic and inorganic materials is 

particularly interesting, since bone is per si a composite material made up of an organic 

phase (mainly collagen) and a mineral phase (hydroxyapatite). 

In this work, a composite material based upon the aliphatic polyester PCL and the ceramic 

hydroxyapatite has been used to produce the scaffolds.

2.1.3  Technologies for scaffolds production  

The mechanical, chemical and biological behaviour of scaffolds depend, in a first instance, 

on the intrinsically properties of the biomaterials used for their production.   

In recent years, a number of fabrication technologies has been applied to process 

biodegradable and bioresorbable materials into 3D polymeric scaffolds. Nowadays, there 

are several techniques to produce scaffolds with different gradients, which can be 

categorized as conventional fabrication techniques or as advanced processing methods 

(non-conventional fabrication techniques).  

 

2.1.3.1  Conventional Fabrication Techniques 

Conventional technologies represent the oldest group of techniques used for scaffolds 

fabrication. They have been used in a large scale at a global level, with relative success. 

These methods include [3,6,17,20,24-26]: 

 

? particulate leaching: involves the mix of solid impurities into a polymer solvent 

solution and casting the dispersion to produce a membrane of polymer and salt 

particles. The salt particles are then leached out with water, in order to obtain a 

porous membrane;  

 

? phase separation: involves dissolving a polymer in a suitable solvent. Then it is 

necessary to place it in a mould, and to cool the mould until the solvent is frozen. 

The micro and macro structure can be controlled varying the quenching temperature, 

solvents and polymer concentration and material;     

 

? supercritical fluid-gassing process: involves the use of polymers highly amorphous. 

The polymer granules are plasticized due to the employment of a gas, such as 

nitrogen at high pressure. The diffusion and dissolution of the gas into the polymer 

matrix results in a reduction of viscosity; 

 

? electrospinning: is a technique to produce nano-fibrous scaffolds. Polymers are 

dissolved into a proper solvent or melted before being submitted to a very high 

voltage to overcome the surface tension and viscoelastic forces, as well as to form 

different fiber diameter (50 nm - 3 ?m). They feature a morphologic similarity to 

the extracellular matrix of natural tissue with effective mechanical properties.  



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

14 

These processes are easy to implement and allow shape and pore size variations by 

changing the parameters of these techniques. However, the resulting organization of the 

pores is random, which can lead to pore pathways that are only partially connected. This 

could impair the supply of nutrients and the ingrowth of tissue and vessels into the scaffold. 

Furthermore, the existence of a substantial number of closed pores makes the resulting 

structures of these scaffolds fabrication processes as effective as films, allowing the 

proliferation in a 2D environment. Nevertheless, they are not suitable to obtain 3D tissues. 

Beyond these limitations, conventional techniques often involve the use of organic solvents 

that may be toxic to the cells. Moreover, these techniques usually involve long fabrication 

times on top of being labour-intensive processes with increased costs [3].  

The following table (Table 2) summarizes some of the key characteristics and parameters 

of these and other conventional techniques currently used.

2.1.3.2  Non-Conventional Fabrication Techniques 

Lately, the scaffolds production with high geometrical precision has been done using automatic 

fabrication technologies [27-28]. The classification of these technologies has undergone many 

changes over time. Initially, they have been classified as technologies of Rapid Prototyping 

(RP), but more recently, according to the standards of the American Society for Testing and 

Materials (ASTM), they became classified as technologies of additive manufacturing 

techniques (AM).  

The basic concept of AM technologies focus on physical reproduction of 3D objects, layer-by-

layer, from bidimensional data (2D), achieved by the slicing of 3D models created with 

systems of CAD/CAM (CAM – Computer Aided Manufacturing) [30].   

Figure 1 provides a general overview of the necessary steps to produce RP/AM scaffolds for 

tissue engineering.  

 

Figure 1: Steps of RP/AM in tissue engineering in [3]. 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

17 

The main advantages of AM technologies are the ability to rapidly produce very complex 3D 

models and to use different materials. These techniques also offer the assurance of 

reproducibility, and, due to the additive nature of the process, this also ensure a minimum 

wasting of biomaterials, being less expensive. Moreover, when combined with imaging data, 

these fabrication techniques can be used to produce custom implants with an adequate internal 

and external geometry, allowing a good coupling between the implant and the native tissue in 

the implantation site [4]. 

These techniques include stereolithographic processes, laser sintering, melt extrusion and three 

dimensional printing.  

 

Stereolithographic processes  

Stereolithography (Figure 2) is one of the most important AM technologies currently available. 

With this process 3D solid objects enables the production in a multi-layer procedure through 

the selective photo-initiated cure reaction of a liquid photosensitive polymer [3,30-31]. These 

processes usually uses two distinct methods of irradiation: mask-based method and direct 

writing process (see Figure 3).  

In the mask-based method an image is transferred to a liquid polymer by irradiating through a 

mask with transparent areas, corresponding to the model section to manufacture. The irradiated 

part of the liquid polymer is then solidified [3]. The second method, a direct writing process, 

uses a focused UV beam to produce the polymer structure. 

 

Figure 2: Stereolithography system in [3]. 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

18 

The direct writing system consists in a vat containing a photosensitive polymer, a moveable 

platform where the model is built, a laser to irradiate the polymer with UV radiation, and a 

dynamic mirror system to direct the laser beam over the polymer surface. After construction 

of each layer, the platform dips into the polymer vat containing the polymer, promoting the 

production of a non-crosslinked polymeric film from which the next layer will be formed [3,31]. 

The next layer is drawn after a wait period to recoat the surface of the previous layer [31].   

The mask-based method builds models by shinning a flood lamp through a mask, which lets 

light pass through it [3,30-31]. The exposure energy will start the curing process on the exposure 

area, forming each cross-section of the 3D physical object [26]. These systems often require 

the generation of a lot of masks, with precise mask alignments. One solution for this problem 

is the use of a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a digital projection system as a flexible mask.

Three-dimensional printing 

Three-dimensional printing (3DP) has been developed at the Massachusetts Institute of 

Technology (MIT) by Sanchs et al. (1989) [29,32]. This process consists in a homogeneous 

distribution of a powder material layer over the work platform, followed by selective 

deposition of an adhesive material in building zones. After the formation of each layer, a piston 

lowers the construction platform, according to the layer thickness, and a new layer of powder 

can be spread over the surface of the previous layer and then selectively joined to it. These 

steps are repeated until the 3D object is completely formed. After finishing the whole process,

a small airflow is used to remove unbound powder that remained in the internal structure of 

the piece [3,29-30,33]. 

Figure 4 represent the 3D printing system.

Laser Sintering 

The process of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), initially proposed by Deckard, uses a laser 

emitting infrared radiation, to selectively heat powder material until reaching a temperature 

near its melting point, Figure 5 [3,30]. 

 

Figure 5: Selective laser sintering process in [3]. 

SLS constructs scaffolds from 3D digital data by sequentially fusing regions on a powder bed, 

layer-by-layer, via a computer controlled scanning laser beam [50]. The laser supplies energy

that fuses neighbouring powder particles, and also bonds each new layer to those previously 

sintered. After the formation and solidification of each layer, the piston over the model retracts 

to a new position and a new layer is supplied using a mechanical roller. The powder that 

remains unaffected by the laser acts as a natural support for the model, remaining in place until 

the model is complete [3-4,30]. 

SLS allows the construction of scaffolds with complex internal and external geometries. 

Virtually any powdered biomaterial that will fuse but not decompose under a laser beam can 

be used to produce scaffolds by this technique [34-35].  

 

Extrusion- based processes  

The extrusion-based rapid prototyping technique, proposed by Crump, is also known as Fused 

Deposition Modelling (FDM), Figure 6. Through this process, thin thermoplastic filaments are 

melted and deposited, layer-by-layer, by a robotic device controlled by a computer, to form the 

intended 3D object. A coil containing material in a wire form feds the robotic device. The 

melted material leaves the extruder in a liquid form and is deposited in a construction platform 

where it hardens immediately [3-4,30,36]. The previously formed layer acts as substrate for the 

next layer, and must be maintained at a slightly lower temperature than the solidification 

temperature of the thermoplastic material. This will promote the proper deposition of the next 

layer and enables a good inter-layer adhesion [3,37].  

 

Figure 6: Fused deposition modelling process in [3]. 

The major limitations of FDM are due to the use of filament-based materials and the high heat 

effect on raw material [37]. Moreover, the phase change phenomena and the processing 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

21 

conditions, considered for each application, may induce chemical and physical transformations 

of the material. As a consequence, the biocompatibility of the initial material can be altered 

during its fabrication process [38]. In order to solve some of these problems, some alternative 

processes have been proposed, such as the requirement of precursor filaments or high 

processing temperatures.   

The IPL (Instituto Politécnico de Leiria) has developed a variant of the FDM process called 

BioExtruder (Figure 7). The scaffolds used in this work were produced by this equipment [3].

2.2  Dental anatomy and root canal treatment 

 

Dental anatomy can be defined as the study of the development, morphology, function and 

identity of each of the teeth in the human dentition, as well as the way in which the teeth are 

related in shape, form, structure, colour and function to the other teeth in the opposite arch 

[39].   

In the human dentition, two sets of teeth erupt during the human lifetime. The first set of teeth 

is the primary dentition, which consists of 10 maxillary and 10 mandibular teeth. It normally 

begins to form 14 weeks after conception and usually it is completed around 3 years of age. 

The second set is the permanent dentition which consists of 16 maxillary and 16 mandibular 

teeth [39-40]. Scientifically, the permanent human dentition can be expressed by the following 

formula: 

 

?

in which the denomination of each tooth is represented by the initial letter of its name (e.g., I 

for incisor, C for canine, P for premolar, M for molar), followed by a horizontal line with the 

number of that kind of teeth in the upper jaw written above the line, and the number in the 

lower jaw written below the line [39,41].  

Each tooth is divided into two major parts: the crown and the root. The crown of the tooth is 

the visible part outside of the gums, projecting from the tissues to which the root is fixed. The 

root of the tooth is the portion which normally is not visible in the oral cavity, and is anchored 

within the bone.  Within each tooth there are four different tissues (Figure 8): enamel, dentine, 

cementum (the hardest tissues of a tooth) and pulp, the soft tissue [39-42].  

Enamel forms the outer surface of the crown of the tooth and it is the hardest tissue in the 

body, which allows the tooth to be able to withstand a great amount of stress, pressure and 

temperature changes [39-40,43]. It is formed by ameloblasts [44]. Chemically, enamel is a highly 

mineralized crystalline structure with approximately 95% to 98% of inorganic matter by 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

23 

weight. The largest mineral present in enamel is hydroxyapatite (HA), which is present in 90% 

to 92% by volume. The remaining constituents of the enamel are an organic content of about 

1% to 2% and a water content of about 4% by weight [40]. When enamel is formed it does not 

have the ability to grow or repair [43,45]. Structurally, enamel is very brittle, and has a high 

elastic modulus and low tensile strength.  

Dentin is formed by odontoblasts, which are considered not only part of the dentin but also of 

the pulp. Hence, many authors consider dentin and pulp as a single specialized connective 

tissue [41]. Chemically, human dentin consists approximately of 75% of inorganic material, 

which is composed mainly by HA, 20% of organic material (mainly collagen), and 5% of water 

and other remaining materials. It is softer than enamel, but harder than cementum and bone. 

 

 

Figure 8: The four tissues of the teeth. 

 

Cementum is the hardest dental tissue of the teeth covering the roots and is formed by 

cementoblasts. Chemically, cementum is composed of approximately 55% of organic material 

and 45% of inorganic material, mainly calcium salts. The organic portion is primarily 

composed of collagen, protein and polysaccharides. Cementum is avascular [40]. 

Dental pulp is a connective tissue located in the core of the tooth, and is surrounded by dentin. 

It is composed by arteries, nerves, veins, lymph vessels, intercellular substances, macrophages 

and odontoblasts, which are able to produce dentin [39-40,43]. The pulp can be divided into two 

areas: the pulp chamber, located in the crown of the tooth; and the pulp canal(s), located in the 

root(s) of the tooth [43].  Beyond the formation of dentin, pulp also has other functions: provides 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

24 

Figure 9: Main steps of the Root Canal treatment adapted from [50]. 

the sensation to the tooth and responds to irritation by forming a secondary dentin or by 

becoming inflamed [46].  

When pulp becomes inflamed or infected a root canal treatment, also known as endodontic 

treatment, is necessary.  During this kind of treatment, the inflamed or infected pulp is removed 

and the inside of the root canals are carefully cleaned and disinfected.  After cleaning of the 

pulp chamber and root canals, the latter are filled with a biocompatible material, with adequate 

physical, chemical and biological properties, to prevent any further infection (Figure 9) [47-49]. 

The filling has three different primary functions: sealing against the penetration of bacteria 

from the oral cavity, isolation of the remaining microorganisms, and prevention of infiltration 

of fluids, that can act as nutrients for bacteria.  

 

 

 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

25 

It is possible to say that the success of root canal treatment depends on proper diagnosis, 

adequate cleaning and shaping and three-dimensional filling of the root canals to prevent 

microorganisms from re-entering in the root canal system and cause re-infection [47,51-52]. 

This procedure allows saving the natural tooth, which implies several advantages: it maintains 

natural appearance, protects other teeth from excessive wear or strain, maintains a normal 

biting force and sensation and also an efficient chewing. 

 

2.2.1  Root Canal Filling Materials 

An ideal root canal filling material should be biocompatible, seal the root canal system in three 

dimensions, should not be affected by tissue fluids and should be insoluble in an oral 

environment [51,53-54]. It also must be nontoxic, radiopaque and easily removed from the canal 

if necessary (to enable re-treatment). Furthermore, it should be easily manipulated, have ample 

working time, should not corrode [51,53-54] and must possess ability to allow or induce bone 

repair [49,54]. Some of these materials also have the ability to flow adequately into the canal 

irregularities and ramifications of the root canal system, which, together with their 

antimicrobial efficacy, aid to eliminate microorganisms from the canal [47].  

The classic filling technique associates a sealer with a solid core material. The core material 

acts as a nucleus for the sealer, and this sealer should fill in the blanks and adhere to the walls 

of the dentin. Root canal filling materials can be divided in two different categories: solid core 

materials (usually gutta-percha cones) and cements/sealers.  

 

2.2.1.1  Gutta-percha 

Gutta-percha is the dried resin of the trees of the family Sapotaceae [55] and has been 

universally accepted by professionals as the best filling material due to its dimensional stability 

and sealing ability. Nowadays, gutta-percha is available in the market in the form of cones 

(Figure 10) of a polymer of an organic matrix (latex) or combined with waxes and resins, zinc 

oxide, calcium carbonate, barium sulphate, strontium sulphate and other components, namely 

dyes. In fact, gutta-percha cones contain only approximately 20% of gutta-percha [56]. While 

pure gutta-percha does not show cytotoxicity effects, cones of gutta-percha show some 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

26 

cytotoxicity, which has been attributed to the zinc oxide component, which is released over 

time [57].    

At room temperature gutta-percha is rigid, becoming 

pliable at temperatures between 25 and 30 ºC, and melting 

at 100ºC, with partial decomposition [58].  

Gutta-percha shows good characteristics such as 

radiopacity, biocompatibility and dimensional stability. 

However, when it is used alone, the cones of gutta-percha 

do not ensure the complete seal of the canals and they also 

do not adhere to the dentin walls [59], reasons why there is 

the need to add a sealer.  

 

2.2.1.2  Sealers 

Endodontic cements, also called sealers, have been demonstrated to be the essential 

components in the formation of a seal during canal filling [60]. They are designed to be used 

only within the root canal system. However during endodontic treatments, sealers sometimes 

become in contact with periapical tissues. Thus, biocompatibility of the sealers is of great 

importance to clinical success of endodontic treatment [61].  

The ability of a sealer to flow, during canal filling procedures, reflects its capacity to penetrate 

into small irregularities and ramifications of the root canal system [47]. It is universally 

accepted that sealers should be able to fill imperfections and increase adaptation of the root 

canal filling [60-63]. Moreover, sealers act as a lubricant during insertion of the gutta-percha 

cones into the radicular system, and allow the filling of spaces where gutta-percha was not able 

to adapt [60].  

Nowadays, there are many types of endodontic sealers commercially available. To date, they 

can be divided into five different groups: zinc-oxide-eugenol-based cements, calcium 

hydroxide cements, glass-ionomers, epoxy resins and silicone-based cements [55,62].  

Figure 10: Gutta-percha cones. 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

27 

In the experimental study performed in this work, the cytotoxicity of three different endodontic 

materials has been studied: one epoxy resin (AH Plus JetTM) and two silicone-based sealers 

(GuttaFlow® 2 and an “improved” GuttaFlow®).  

 

Zinc-oxide-eugenol-based cements 

Zinc oxide-eugenol has been used by dentists for many decades as a temporary filling and also 

as a cement for endodontic treatments. Eugenol is correlated with phenol, a weak acid, and 

both have shown anaesthetic effects and germicidal activity [97] although biological effects of 

eugenol vary with concentration. At lower concentrations eugenol may have a beneficial effect, 

but higher concentrations may be cytotoxic (can cause cell death and/or inhibit cell division 

and respiration) [59,64]. 

When eugenol is mixed with zinc oxide, a chelation reaction occurs between the eugenol and 

the zinc ion of the zinc oxide, and a zinc eugenolate is formed [64-65]. This reaction can also 

occur between the eugenol and the zinc oxide phase of gutta-percha, which may explain the 

increase in volume of gutta-percha in contact with eugenol. Thus, increasing the proportion of 

eugenol into the zinc-oxide-eugenol-based cement enhances the volume expansion of the 

gutta-percha [65], which can result in a better sealing ability, but increase the risk of undesirable 

effects of eugenol. 

 

Calcium hydroxide cements 

The first clinical use of calcium hydroxide as a root filling material occurred in 1940, by 

Rhoner. Initially, these sealers were popular for pulp covering and for apexification techniques, 

although today the two main reasons for its use in endodontic treatment are stimulation of the 

periapical tissues in order to promote regeneration and its anti-microbial effects [66].  

The therapeutic effect of calcium hydroxide in endodontic treatment is due to its dissolution 

when in contact with tissue and tissue fluids in the root canals, which leads to a continuous 

dissociation of calcium hydroxide in its ions (Ca+ and OH-) [67]. 

 



Chapter 2 – Literature review 

 

28 

Glass-ionomers 

Glass ionomer cements are a group of materials based on acid/base reaction between 

poly(alkenoic) acid and an ion-leachable silicate glass. These materials show a release of 

fluoride ions over an extended period of time [68]. 

Initially, its use in dentistry was limited by its slow setting time and its lack of strength, 

although some alterations in the formulations of these materials result in new materials with 

properties that are clinically useful in dentistry. Its biocompatibility with bone and 

osteoconductive behaviour are two of those properties. Besides, it exhibits modified working 

and setting times, no shrinkage upon setting and high adaptation to the canal walls and 

radiopacity [69].  

 

Epoxy resins 

Epoxy resin are commonly used as root canal filling materials due to their favourable 

properties regarding leakage prevention and biological responses [70]. Within this group of 

resins AH Plus is the most successful of the sealers.  

 

Silicone-based cements 

Silicone has been used in medicine as implant material due to its desirable properties like 

biocompatibility and inertness [71]. Silicone-based materials have been developed as root canal 

sealers, showing laboratory and clinical promising data [72]. Silicones show little leakage, and 

are virtually non-toxic [73].  

The most used silicone-based cement is GuttaFlow®, which was replaced by GuttaFlow® 2. 

GuttaFlow® 2 is the result of some modifications in the composition of GuttaFlow® in order to 

improve it, since the presence of silicone in GuttaFlow® induces poor wetting on the root dentin 

surface. This condition produces high surface tension forces, making the spreading of these 

materials more difficult.  Another disadvantage of GuttaFlow® is that it does not adhere 

chemically to the dentin [73].

Materials and characterization techniques 
 

In this chapter the main materials and techniques used in this work will be described. This 

chapter is divided into three main sections. In the first, the materials used for scaffolds 

fabrication, specifically PCL and HA, and the techniques used for their production and 

characterization will be described. In the second section, the compositions of the endodontic 

cements tested in this work will be referred, as well as their main characteristics. Finally, in 

the third section, the assay used for cytotoxicity evaluation of both scaffolds and endodontic 

sealers will be described. 

 

3.1  Materials used for scaffolds fabrication and techniques for their 

production and characterization 

 

3.1.1  Materials 

As previously referred, the production of scaffolds with adequate biomechanical properties for 

TE depends on several factors: materials used, pore geometry and structure interconnectivity. 

Over the past few years several studies have been reported based on the use of ceramic and 

polymeric materials. For example, biphasic composite materials (organic-inorganic) have the 

ability to combine the good mechanical strength of polymers with the high compressive 

strength of ceramics. Thus, based in the literature, for this work, composite scaffolds of PCL 

and HA were used. HA can be from natural or synthetic origin. Different pore sizes and 

geometries, have been selected in order to analyse their influence in cell adhesion, 

differentiation and proliferation.  

 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques

Poly (?-caprolactone)  

Poly(?-caprolactone), an US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved material [17] is 

one of the most widely diffused biodegradable and non-cytotoxic polymer used as biomaterial 

for the production of scaffolds for TE [1-2]. It is an aliphatic polyester, semi-crystalline, 

biocompatible, with a melting temperature (Tm) between 55 and 60 ºC and a glass transition 

temperature (Tg) of ? - 60 ºC [28,74]. The molecular structural unit of PCL is composed by five 

non-polar methylene groups and one relatively polar ester group. This structure gives PCL 

some unique properties, such as high processability and high thermal stability (its degradation 

temperature is near to 350ºC).  

PCL can be prepared either by ring-opening polymerization of ?-caprolactone (using anionic, 

cationic and co-ordination catalysts) or via free radical ring-opening polymerization of 2-

methylene-1-3-dioxepane, Figure 11 [28]. Ring-opening polymerization can be applied to 

produce high molecular weight polymers, under mild reaction conditions and in shorter time, 

opposing to polycondensation, which requires higher temperature and longer reaction times 

[75].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

PCL can be degraded by micro-organisms or by a hydrolytic mechanism under physiological 

conditions. In some specific situations, cross-linked PCL also can be degraded enzymatically 

by surface erosion [2]. Its degradation rate can be modified by the co-polymerization with other 

lactones or mix with other polymers [2]. Moreover, PCL has good dissolution in common 

organic solvents and its mechanical properties, added to its rate of bioresorption, contributes 

for PCL being one of the most used biomaterials in bone scaffold’s applications [1,8]. 

Figure 11: Synthesis of poly(?-caprolactone) by ring-openning polymerization in [20]. 

 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

31 

Even though it has a good bioresorption for bone tissue engineering, as well as suitable 

mechanical properties [1], PCL shows a lack of bioactivity. Thus, when used in bone TE, the 

new bone tissue cannot bind tightly to the polymer surface [3]. This impairs its use as a scaffold 

for hard tissue regeneration, unless mechanical reinforcement is provided [74]. 

 

Hydroxyapatite (HA) 

Hydroxyapatite is one of the most attractive materials for hard tissue implants due to its close 

resemblance to bones and teeth [75-78]. It is a class of calcium phosphate based bioceramic, 

with high biocompatibility and osteoconductivity [76-79]. HA is not only a biocompatible and 

osteoconductive, non-toxic, non-inflammatory and non-immunogenic agent, but also bioactive, 

i.e. it has got the ability to form a direct chemical bond with living tissues [76-78,80]. 

Additionally, the chemical similarity with bones and teeth is determinant in apatite deposition 

process (in vitro and in vivo), protein adsorption and subsequent bone regeneration. Its high 

biocompatibility with hard tissues, skin and muscle contributes to increase its acceptance as an 

implant [76,81]. Moreover, HA ceramics have the ability to induce mesenchymal cells to 

differentiate into osteoblasts. Therefore, HA is considered a good scaffold material for tissue 

engineering [82].  

However, despite its inherent bioactivity and its excellent biocompatibility, HA is very brittle, 

difficult to shape and has poor tensile properties [77,79].  

HA can be derived from natural or synthetic sources. The ceramic form of synthetic HA 

(Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), polycrystalline and densely sintered, is considered non-resorbable [83] or 

very little resorbable (1-2% per year) [84]. It has low bioactivity and acts mainly as a bioactive 

implant.  The natural HA is non-stoichiometric (exhibits a Ca/P ratio higher than 1.67) and 

contains carbonate groups (CO3)
2- instead of groups (PO4)

3- and magnesium and sodium ions 

(Mg2+, Na2+) in place of calcium ions (Ca2+) [85-86]. The presence of carbonate groups tends to 

decrease the crystallinity and to augment the solubility of HA, enhancing its biodegradation 

rate. Thus, the main difference between the synthetic and natural HA is the carbonate content 

which is smaller in synthetic HA [87]. 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

32 

The natural HA materials have the advantage to maintain the chemical composition and 

structure of the raw materials, from which they were manufactured, such as the pore structure 

[85]. Nevertheless, the use of natural HA in TE as substitute can induce the risk of disease 

transmission [44]. One way to reduce this risk is to do a heat treatment, usually at high 

temperatures. However, this can result in a change of composition, particularly by carbonate 

loss. This treatment can also induce a modification of the structure due to sintering of crystals, 

with consequent decrease of porosity, which reduces the effectiveness of the material [87].  

 

3.1.2  Technology used for scaffolds production: BioExtruder 

As referred in Chapter 2, the scaffolds used in this work were developed at IPL (Instituto 

Politécnico de Leiria) using a variant of FDM (fusion deposition modelling) called 

BioExtruder  

BioExtruder is a low cost and high reproducible system enabling the fabrication of multi-

material scaffolds, as well as a controlled definition of pores into the scaffold, to modulate 

mechanical strength and molecular diffusion [4,37-38].  

The BioExtruder comprises two different deposition systems: one rotational system for multi-

material deposition and another one for a unimaterial deposition that uses a screw to assist the 

deposition process [Figure 12 (a) and (b)] [38]. The multimaterial deposition system is 

composed by a rotational structure with four reservoirs, two of which with temperature control 

system, that are motioned by a pneumatic mechanism. The unimaterial extrusion system is 

endowed with a screw that assists in the material deposition. The BioExtruder allows the 

utilization of extrusion nozzles with diameters between 0.1 and 1 mm. The deposition code 

developed in Matlab (The Math-Works, Inc.) is based on the programming language ISO, 

usually used in CNC machines (Computer Numerical Control). 

The information flow chart to produce scaffolds through the unimaterial extrusion system, 

which will be used in this work involves three main steps: (1) generation of a virtual 3D solid 

model directly by CAD software, or using data obtained by the imaging techniques (Magnetic 

Resonance Imaging  or Computer Tomography); (2) conversion of the 3D model to a STL file 

(Stereolithographic file), which is the standard file for faceted models (common language for 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

33 

all rapid prototyping equipment); (3) mathematical slicing of the STL file into thin layers or 

slices (sliced model); (4) each layer or slice is then physically reproduced by the BioExtruder 

[3].

3.1.3  Scaffolds characterization 
 

Thermogravimetry 

Thermogravimetric analysis or thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is used as a method to 

investigate the thermal decomposition of polymers and to assess their relative thermal 

stabilities [88]. TGA uses heat to force reactions and physical changes on materials. The sample 

is placed in a micro-weighting machine, which is within an oven, to induce the heating 

conditions. TGA allows that changes in physical and chemical properties of materials are 

measured as a function of temperature increase (with a constant heating rate) or as function of 

time (with constant temperature or constant mass loss) [89]. 

The obtained results can be shown as a thermogravimetric curve (TG), in which it is reported 

the mass variation (in percentage) of the sample in function of temperature/time or in the form 

of a derivative termogravimetric curve (DTG), where the first curve TG is shown as function 

of temperature/time, Figure 13. 

 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

34 

 

Characteristic thermogavimetric curves are given for specific materials and chemical 

compounds due to a unique sequence from physicochemical reactions occurring over specific 

temperature ranges and heating rates. This characteristics are related to the molecular structure 

of the sample.  

The weight and the preparation settings of the sample can influence the results obtained. Thus, 

samples with reduced mass and dimensions should be used, to avoid linearity deviation during 

heating [91]. 

 

Helium pycnometer   

Helium pycnometer (Figure 14) is a laboratory device used for measuring the density and 

volume of a wide variety of materials in a simple and accurate manner [92]. The test for 

pycnometric density of solids is intended to determine the volume occupied by a known mass 

of powder. This is achieved by measuring the volume of gas displaced under defined conditions, 

similarly to the Archimedes method (the volume of liquid displaced by an object completely 

immersed in it, is equal to the volume of the object) [93-94]. 

The basic technique relies on measuring the material volume within the scaffold from a change 

in helium pressure, due to the presence of the scaffold in a known volume of gas. Helium is 

able to fully penetrate the porous structure of the scaffold without any problem due to surface 

tension, since it behaves as an ideal gas and has small atomic dimensions.

Low-pressure plasma treatment  

Plasma is a simple concept which refers to the fourth chemical state of matter (i.e., in the 

presence of sufficient energy, a solid can be melted to a liquid, a liquid vaporized into a gas, 

and a gas ionized into plasma). Plasma is a partially ionized gas containing ions, electrons, 

atoms and neutral species [96].  

Plasma surface modification involves the interaction of the plasma-generated excited species 

with a solid interface [97]. When the plasma comes in contact with the material surface it 

transfers additional energy from the plasma to allow subsequent reactions to take place on the 

material surface. The plasma process results in a physical and/or chemical modification of the 

first few molecular layers of the surface, while maintaining the bulk properties.  

Low-pressure plasma technology is an environmentally friendly and cost-efficient way to 

modify material surfaces, at microscopic level, without manual operations or the use of 

chemical products [96]. The process is carried out under vacuum conditions, to enable the gas 

to be ionized in a controlled manner. Plasma systems generally comprises five main 

components: the vacuum vessel, a pumping group, a gas-introduction and gas-control system, 

a high-frequency generator and a microprocessor-based system controller [96].  

The surface modification processes can be divided into four categories: contamination removal, 

surface activation, etch and crosslinking. The surface activation was the used technique in this 

work. Plasma surface modification employs gases such as oxygen and nitrogen, which, when 

exposed to the plasma, will dissociate and react with the surface, creating different chemical

functional groups on the surface of the material. The new functional groups have strong 

chemical bonds with the bulk material and have the ability to further bond with adhesives to 

promote better adhesion. The functional groups also increase the surf adhesive strength [97-98]. 

A specially developed plasma activation process can be used to make a substrate surface more 

hydrophilic. Gas selection and surface type determine the functional group that will be 

substituted on the surface.  

 

3.1.4  Scaffolds sterilization 
 

Sterilization is defined as a process that intends to remove or destroy all viable forms of 

microbial life, including bacterial spores, in order to achieve an acceptable level of sterilization. 

Thus sterilization implies the inactivation and removal of all forms of life [99]. The efficacy of 

any sterilization process will depend on the nature of the product, the extent and type of 

contamination and conditions under which the final product has been prepared. It is expected 

that the sterilization method should not damage or modify the surface/structure of the material.  

Biomedical devices prepared from biodegradable polyesters are usually sterilized by ethylene 

oxide, since other sterilization procedures, such as irradiation and heat, can cause extensive 

deformation of the devices and accelerated polymer degradation.  

 

Ethylene oxide sterilization 

Ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization is a commonly used method for the sterilization of heat-

sensitive materials, such as medical equipment and pharmaceutical products that cannot endure 

conventional high temperature steam sterilization, due to the extreme penetrability of EO 

molecule and its compatibility with a wide range of materials [100-101].  

EO sterilization has stood the test of time as a very effective sterilant, being good at killing a 

wide range of pathogens and sterilizing the most complex shapes [102]. It was developed in 

1940 as a sterilizing agent by the US military, and its use as a medical sterilant dates to the late 

50’s. The sterilizing efficiency of EO depends on a series of factors such as the concentration 

of the gas, humidity, time of exposure, temperature and the nature of the load [103]. 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques

Sterilization via EO exposure begins with the adequate packaging of the scaffolds and their 

placement into a pressurized sterilization chamber. The humidity within the chamber is 

controlled by the introduction of moisture (40-90% humidity) and the temperature is 

maintained between 40 and 50ºC. The EO is then introduced into the chamber at concentrations 

ranging 600 to 1200 mg.L-1 for sufficient time (between 2-48 h) to achieve the desired SAL 

(sterility assurance level). After the sterilization, room air is used to flush the vessel to remove 

residual EO and its toxic byproducts but increases the overall sterilization time.  

Chemically, EO reacts with nucleic acids, which contributes to kill microorganisms. Moreover, 

EO is an exceptional sterilizing agent due to its bactericidal, sporicidal, and virucidal activity. 

The greatest disadvantage of EO sterilization is the toxicity and carcinogenicity of the residual 

byproducts: ETO, ETC (ethylene chlorohydrin) and ETG (ethylene glycol) [99].

3.2  Endodontic cements and study models used for its in vivo cytotoxicity 

evaluation 

 

3.2.1  Endodontic cements used 
 

In this work, as referred in Chapter 1, three different sealers will be tested: AH Plus JetTM, 

which is an epoxy-resin composed of amines, and two silicone-based cements GuttaFlow®2 

and the “improved” GuttaFlow®, that combines gutta-percha in a powder form with a sealer 

(polydimethylsiloxane). These sealers are available in self mixing syringes for direct 

application. In this work AH PlusTM, GuttaFlow®2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow® were 

evaluated in order to determine which of these three endodontic cements show lower 

cytotoxicity and better biocompatibility. 

The composition and characteristics of the “improved” GuttaFlow® will not be described, since 

it is not yet on the market, being still in study (under non-disclosure/confidentiality). 

 

AH PlusTM 

 

AH PlusTM is an epoxy-resin whose first formulation was developed more than 50 years ago 

in Switzerland [55]. It has been shown to have low solubility and outstanding flow 

characteristics. AH PlusTM also shows low disintegration, good adhesion and excellent 

radiopacity [104]. It is usually used in combination with gutta-percha. However, although it has 

adequate long-term dimensional stability, it does not bond to gutta-percha, which is why its 

ability remains controversial [105]. 

Nowadays, AH PlusTM is commercially available into two different forms (Figure 15):  

? AH PlusTM in tubes, pastes A and B, for manual mixing; 

? AH Plus JetTM in self-mixing syringes for direct intra-oral application, for a 

more appropriated application (easier, quicker and precise). 

The pastes A and B of AH Plus TM have different compositions. Paste A is an epoxy paste and 

is composed by bisphenol-A epoxy resin, bisphenol-F epoxy resin, calcium tungsten, 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

39 

zirconium oxide, silica and iron oxide particles. While paste B is an amine paste composed by 

three different types of amines, calcium tungsten, zirconium oxide, silicone oils and silica. The 

calcium tungsten, present in the AH Plus JetTM composition, is much used to increase the 

radiopacity of the filling materials. 

The form used in this work was the AH Plus JetTM. 

 

 

Figure 15: AH Plus JetTM and Ah PlusTM in tubes, respectively. 

 

GuttaFlow® 2  
 

GuttaFlow® 2 (Coltène/Whaledent, Langenau, Germany) is a novel silicone-based material for 

root canal filling that combines gutta-percha in a powder form with a particle size of less than 

30 µm and a sealer (polydimethylsiloxane), into an auto-mix syringe (see Figure 16) [106-107].  

 

 

Figure 16: Automaxic serynge of GuttaFlow®2. 

It is the first sealer/gutta-percha combination sealer, flowable at room temperature that can be 

used not only as a sealer, but also as an obturating paste without a solid master cone. This 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

40 

combination has as main goal to solve the problems resulting from the formation of interfaces 

between sealer - gutta-percha cones and sealer – and internal tooth structure which on setting 

causes shrinkage of sealer and, thus, voids are created resulting in the absence of complete seal. 

The micro-silver in GuttaFlow® 2 is a metallic silver that is uniformly distributed on the surface 

of the filling [106] and which constitutes the antibacterial component, providing an optimum 

protection against re-infection of the root canal. It does not cause corrosion or colour changes 

in the GuttaFlow® [75]. 

It has some characteristics that makes it almost an ideal root filling material, such as good 

homogeneity and adaptation to the root canal walls [81], excellent physical and biological 

properties [107], good biocompatibility [106] and excellent flow properties, which ensure 

optimum distribution throughout the root canal. GuttaFlow® 2 also shows virtually no 

solubility, resulting in a dimensionally stable and impervious root canal filling with great 

adhesion to the dentine wall [73].  

Despite all these advantages, a study done by Rana M. et al. [52] compared the results obtained 

using GuttaFlow® 2 with and without the solid support (gutta-percha cones). The results 

showed that, although GuttaFlow® 2 without the solid support has good adherence to the dental 

walls and also good physical properties, when combined with a solid support it shows better 

results [52]. In this context, Coltène developed a new material in order to improve the physical 

and mechanical properties of GuttaFlow® 2. The study of the cytotoxicity of this new material 

(which will be designed by “improved” GuttaFlow® in this dissertation) is one of the main 

goals of this work. 

 

3.2.2  In vivo cytotoxicity of endodontic cements and study models 
 

The implantation of endodontic cements in tissues of small size animal models has as it goal 

to test the local toxic effect [108]. 

Bone and connective tissues have been widely used to test the in vivo cytotoxicity and 

consequent biocompatibility of endodontic cements. The materials are introduced in the above 

mentioned tissues, using mainly small size animals, such as rabbits and rats. The interface 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

41 

material/tissue can be direct or indirect, by inclusion in tubes/supports of different 

compositions [108-109]. 

For bone implantation, the materials are placed in cavities that are prepared for this purpose in 

the mandible, tibia or skull of the animal. For connective tissue implantation, the materials are 

injected or implanted in locas created by surgical dissection in the cellular subcutaneous tissue 

or in oral mucosa. Many authors have chosen to use cellular subcutaneous tissue of rats as a 

model to evaluate the histological response to the implantation of endodontic cements, which 

can be contained in tubes made of several materials or in direct contact with tissues [108]. 

 

Subcutaneous implantation 
 

In the present work, the histological response of the subcutaneous tissue of the rat to the 

presence of AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow®2 and of the “improved” GuttaFlow® is studied. For 

this purpose, the tested materials were inserted in 8 mm tubes (Chapter 4), which latter were 

implanted in locas done by surgical dissection in the cellular subcutaneous tissue.  

The materials that are implanted adsorb a layer of proteins, which results in a surface 

modification of the implant by them. The aggression that is caused in a vascularized tissue, 

due to the placing of the material, triggers an inflammatory response with immediate release 

of active biological substances that induce the migration of blood cells (e.g. neutrophils) to the 

reaction site [110]. Toxic materials cause necrosis of the surrounding tissues. Biocompatible 

materials are not susceptible to phagocytosis by neutrophils. The macrophages, whose 

migration is slower, are the ones that engulf and digest the implant as a foreign body. 

Macrophages are unsuccessful, and in order to increase their effectiveness in the engulfment 

process, they will fuse to form giant cells. However, these cell are incapable of engulfing the 

implant. Thus, the giant cells send chemical signals in order to bring fibroblasts to the implant 

site. This process is often called frustrated phagocytosis. Fibroblasts encapsulate the implant 

in a thin, avascular collagenous bursa to isolate it from the body [109-110]. This process is 

illustrated in Figure 17.  



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques

Histologic technique 

Histology is the study of cellular organization of body tissues and organs. The histologic 

technique is the operation set that has as its main goal to transform cells and tissues into 

preparations for light microscopy. The required steps occur in successive phases according 

with the fundamental principles of the histologic technique. These steps include fixation, 

dehydration, embedding in a suitable medium, sectioning into thin slices to enable the 

observation by transillumination, and staining [108-110]. 

Fixation refers to treatment of the tissue with chemical agents that retard the alterations of 

tissue subsequent to death (or after removal from the body) and maintain its normal 

architecture. [110]. This process can be divided into two different phases: (1) the coagulation 

or precipitation of several components of the tissue and cells; (2) their preservation in a state 

as nearly as possible like the living condition by forming stable chemical compounds [111]. An 

ideal fixative must penetrate quickly, render all parts of all cells permanent and allow the use 

of all kinds of stains. However, since the cell is a highly complex mixture of proteins, 

carbohydrates and lipids, and an ideal fixative would not only have to form stable compounds 

Figure 17: A schematic representation of the time course of the foreign body reaction 
to an implanted “biocompatible” material in [110]. 

 



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

43 

with all of these, but also render them insoluble both in lipic solvents and in water, it has not 

been possible to find an ideal fixative. Some fixatives not only fail to preserve certain parts of 

the cell but actually dissolve or destroy them. For example, acetic acid destroys mitochondria. 

Moreover, some fixatives change the shape and relationship of parts of a tissue by shrinkage. 

Nowadays, the most common fixative agent used in light microscopy is neutral buffered 

formaldehyde. It penetrates rapidly, causes little distortion, does not destroy any of the cellular 

constituents and can be followed by almost all staining methods. However, it hardens the 

tissues very slowly, and does not protect them from the shrinking agents employed in 

embedding and sectioning. For this reason it is often combined with other fixing agents 

[109,111-112].  

Dehydration is done due the fact that a large fraction of the tissues is composed of water, and 

water and paraffin (the usual embedding medium for light microscopy) do not mix. Thus, this 

phase consists in transferring the sample of tissue through a series of alcohol-water solutions 

beginning with 50% or 75% alcohol and progressing in graded steps to 100% alcohol, in order 

to remove the water (dehydration). Then, the tissue is treated with xylene. This last process is 

known as clearing, since the tissue becomes transparent in xylene [109,111].  

In order to distinguish the overlapping cells in a tissue and the extracellular matrix, the tissues 

must be embedded in a proper medium (e.g. paraffin/paraplast) and then sliced into thin 

sections. Embedding takes place when the paraffin-infiltrated tissue is placed in fresh paraffin 

and the latter allowed to cool. After the blocks of paraffin are trimmed of excess embedding 

material, they are mounted for sectioning. Sectioning is accomplished by using a cutting 

apparatus called a microtome. The microtome will drive a knife across the surface of the 

paraffin cube and produce a series of thin sections of very precise thickness. The objective is 

to produce a continuous "ribbon" of sections adhering to one another by their leading and 

trailing edges. The thickness of the sections can be preset, and a thickness between 5 - 10 ?m 

is optimal for observation with a light microscope [109-111]. The sections can then be mounted 

on glass slides and then stained by water-soluble stains that enable differentiation of the 

different cellular components [109,113].  



Chapter 3 – Materials and characterization techniques 

 

44 

Staining of histological sections allows observation of features otherwise not distinguishable. 

For routine histological work, it is common to use two dyes, one that stains certain components 

a bright color and the other, called the counterstain, which stains other cellular structures, a 

contrasting color. The most commonly used stains in histology are hematoxylin and eosin 

(H&amp;amp;E). Hematoxylin is a base that preferentially colors the acidic components of the cell a 

bluish tint. Since the most acidic components are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic 

acid (RNA), the nucleus and regions of the cytoplasm rich in ribosomes stain dark blue; these 

components are referred to as basophilic. Eosin is an acid that dyes the basic components of 

the cell in a pinkish color. As many cytoplasmic constituents have a basic pH, regions of the 

cytoplasm stain pink; these elements are said to be acidophilic [109-110].

3.3  In vitro cytotoxicity assay  
 

Measurement of cell viability and proliferation are the basis for several in vitro assays of a cell 

population’s response to external factors. The reduction of tetrazolium salts is now widely 

accepted as a reliable way to examine cell proliferation and, consequently, the cytotoxicity of 

the materials in study.  

The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay is based on 

the ability of the dehydrogenase enzyme, present in metabolically active cells, to cleave the 

tetrazolium ring of MTT and consequently convert the yellow water-soluble tetrazolium salt 

into dark-blue/purple formazan crystals insoluble in aqueous solution [10-12]. This reduction 

process (Figure 18) is associated with the function of dehydrogenases, but may also be due to 

the action of molecules such as NADH and NADPH (reducing equivalents). The amount of 

formazan crystals formed is directly proportional to the mitochondrial enzyme activity, i.e. to 

the number of viable cells present [114-116]. After an adequate period of incubation of cells in 

the presence of the MTT solution, the MTT formazan reaction product is only partially soluble 

in the medium, thus an alcohol is used to dissolve the formazan and produce a homogenous 

solution, suitable for measurement of optical density [10]. Therefore, by ELISA 

spectrophotometry, it is possible to quantify the amount of formed crystals, which is a measure 

of metabolic activity. 

 

  

Figure 18: Schematic MTT reduction to formazan. This reaction can only occur when the reducing enzymes are active. This 
conversion is, therefore, used to measure cell viability in [115].

Chapter 4 

Experimental 
 

4.1  Introduction 

In this chapter the procedures used to test the biological performance of the biomaterials, 

namely their cytotoxicity character, will be described in detail.  

Regarding the biofabricated scaffolds, different aspects have been explored. As mentioned 

before, these scaffolds were produced by an additive biofabrication process, controlled by a 

computer (bioextrusion) using a mixture of poly(?-caprolactone) and hydroxyapatite. Scaffolds 

with different composition and architectural features have been produced, being one of the 

aims of this work to study the effects of these properties on the cytotoxicity/cellular interaction. 

The following points have been studied:  

? pore size and geometry: porous matrices can be produced with different structural 

parameters by varying pore size and the deposition angle of the filament of the material 

during the layers formation. In the present work samples with two different pore sizes 

and angles were used: pore size of 300 and 600 µm and geometries of 0/45º and 0/90º 

(Figure 19). In fact, nowadays it is recognized that the microstructure of the scaffolds, 

more specifically the pore dimension and geometry, plays an essential role in cell 

adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, as well as in the vascularization process and 

tissue growth [6, 44]; 

? matrix composition: the scaffolds have been produced of pure PCL and of mixtures 

of PCL and hydroxyapatite (HA) in different percentages (10% and 25% of HA by 

weight). The idea behind the addition of HA is to improve osteoconduction, bioactivity, 

hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of the scaffolds, based on literature data [117]. 

In this work two different types of HA were used, synthetic and natural: HA S and HA 

N, respectively. As previously referred HA N differs from HA S since HA N is a poor

crystalline apatite and calcium deficient, resulting in alterations of its physical 

properties, which in turn highly affects the development of the cells; 

? surface properties: due to the hydrophobic character of PCL, it was decided to modify 

the surface of the scaffolds using plasma technology, in order to improve the scaffolds 

hydrophilicity and thus promote a greater interaction between cells and scaffolds. The 

samples with a modified surface by plasma treatment tested in this work were 

composed of pure PCL and of PCL with 10% of HA S by weight.  

 

 

 

 

Concerning the endodontic materials, three different samples were tested: an epoxy-resin and 

two different silicone-based sealers, one of them not yet on the market as referred in Chapter 

3. For these samples, besides in vitro cytotoxicity assays, in vivo studies were performed, in 

order to evaluate the inflammatory response to these materials.  

Thus, this chapter is divided in four main parts. In the first one, the cells used in this work will 

be addressed, as well as the justification for their selection. In the second part the procedures 

adopted for the study of the influence of HA and of the scaffolds architecture in cell adhesion 

and proliferation will be described. Then, the in vitro and in vivo studies performed with 

endodontic materials/cements will be described. Finally, in the last part of this chapter, the 

statistical analysis done in order to analyze the obtained results will be referred.

4.2  Cell lines and cell cultures  

The toxicity of materials is usually tested using cell cultures, at least in early stages, in order 

to decrease the number of in vivo studies. Indeed, tests on cell cultures are simple, fast and 

economical, and allow to test a wide variety of cells and co-culture under the same conditions. 

Additionally, these tests are reproducible and easy to perform. Moreover, in vitro tests have 

the advantage of using a culture medium with standard composition, defined incubation 

environment and sterile working conditions, enabling precise quantitative and qualitative 

assessments. However, the in vitro obtained results cannot be directly extrapolated to clinical 

situations. The importance of conducting in vitro studies is due to the fact that they are a first 

approach to analyze the effects of the tested materials and provide preliminary information to 

plan with the experimental process. They are intended to determine the biological mechanisms 

of action, without interference of other variables to influence results. This is one of the main 

reasons why the in vitro design has a fundamental role in the development of such studies, 

allowing to decrease the number of the performed in vivo studies (according to the 3R’s 

principle)1. 

Since one of the possible applications of the materials tested in this study is the in vivo maxilla-

mandible-facial implantation, they will be in direct contact with the cells of the connective 

                                                 

1 The 3 R’s principle was launched in the early 1960s by two English biologists, Russel and Burch in 
their book “The Principle of Humane Experimental Technique”. The 3 Rs stand for Replacement, 

Reduction and Refinement. 

Replacement: refer to the substitution of conscious living higher animals for insentient material. There 

are a number of alternative methods that can be used to replace the use of living animals in either all or 

part of a project. Replacement may be relative, when animals are still required to provide cells or tissue, 

but experiments are conducted in vitro: tissue culture, perfused organs, tissue slices, cellular and 

subcelluylar fractions [118].  

Reduction alternatives: refer to any strategy that will result in fewer animals being used to obtain 

sufficient data to answer the research question, or in maximizing the information obtained per animal 

and thus potentially limiting or avoiding the subsequent use of additional animals, without 

compromising animal welfare [119]. 

Refinement alternatives: refer to the modification of husbandry or experimental procedures to 

minimize pain and distress, and to enhance the welfare of an animal used in science from the time it is 

born until its death [119].

tissue of the gum. Regarding the endodontic cements, in case of root canal perforation, they 

will be in direct contact with the periapical tissues. In this context it was decided to perform in 

vitro studies with human fibroblasts, since they are the major cell constituent of connective 

tissue and are found in all areas of the body. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis of 

most components of connective tissue, including collagen, elastic fibers and proteoglycans 

[120-122]. They are adherent cells with a flat and elongated shape. Their main function is to 

produce extracellular matrix components (ECM), which consist of glycosaminoglycans, 

proteoglycans and fibrous structural proteins such as laminin, fibronectin, elastin and collagens 

that make up the extracellular matrix and maintain tissue architecture. The matrix proteins are 

also involved in wound healing and epithelial repair. Thus, they are used in culture studies as 

a support layer for cell proliferation.  

The fibroblasts used in the development of this work are human fibroblasts isolated and 

cultured from the dental pulp. These fibroblasts were provided by the Area of Endodontics, 

Department of Dentistry of Coimbra University2. 

Besides human fibroblasts, macrophages were also used in the in vitro studies, since 

macrophages (and their precursors, monocytes) are the “big eaters/cleaners” of the immune 

system. They have highly variable morphological characteristics that will depend on their state 

of functional activity, and on the tissue where they were found. Macrophages are frequently 

used in in vitro studies since they are large, specialized cells that recognize, engulf and destroy 

target cells/particles/materials. They can change their functional phenotype depending on the 

environmental cues they receive [123]. Through their ability to clear pathogens and instruct 

other immune cells, macrophages have a central role in protecting the host but also contribute 

to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative diseases [124-125]. 

The harvest of human macrophages maintaining the desirable characteristics is very difficult 

to achieve and can be a source of possible biological contamination for the user. Rat or mouse 

peritoneal macrophages have the same characteristics as human macrophages [126]. Since naive 

macrophages do not divide in vitro by themselves, the Cell Line Companies must modify the

human fibroblasts used in this work.

harvested macrophages from either of these three species. This can be achieved with long 

periods of time of cell culture with exogenous growth factors [Rattus norvegicus alveolar 

macrophages, ATCC® CRL-2192™] or transformation using virus (e.g. SV40 3  or murine 

leukemia virus) [Mus musculus peritoneal macrophages, ATCC® TIB-186™or ATCC® 

TIB71™] or, if obtained from mononuclear peripheral human blood, they grow as single cells 

in suspension [ATCC® CRL-9855™]. Neither of these hypotheses was viable for this work 

purposes or budget. 

In this context, at IBILI, peritoneal macrophages of rats are currently used for in vitro studies 

to study the inflammatory response of living tissues, since they play a key role on innate 

acquired immune defense. The peritoneal macrophages used in this work were harvested by 

the team from Wistar rats raised at IBILI.  

To harvest these macrophages, each animal was sacrificed by cervical dislocation (according 

to Annex II of the Portuguese Law Decree nº 113/2013). Then the procedure was done in 

another room with a flow laminar chamber (Holten, HB 2448, verified by IPAC), where UV 

light was previously on during approximately 30 minutes. After this time the UV is switched 

off and the flow laminar chamber was cleaned with alcohol at 75%. All the necessary 

procedures were done inside the flow laminar chamber using gloves and sterile material. All 

the enclosed sterile materials entering the flow chamber (syringes, needles and falcons) had 

been previously disinfected with alcohol at 75%.  

Rats were disinfected with alcohol and put inside the chamber in a disinfected container. Then, 

20 mL of a Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) [137 mM of NaCl (Sigma, S7653), 2.7 mM of KCl 

(Sigma, P9333), 10 mM of NaH2PO4 (Panreac, 1319651211), 1.8 mM of KH2PO4 (Merck, 

6580), ultrapure water; pH 7.4] were injected in the peritoneum using a 25G × 1’’, 0.5 × 25 

mm, needle ( T Terumos® Neolus, NN-2525R) and, after an abdominal massage, the liquid 

was harvested with a 1 mL syringe (T Terumos®, SS+01T1) coupled to a 19G × 1’’, 1.1 × 25 

mm, needle ( T Terumos® Neolus, NN-1925R) (Figure 20). Sterile 15 mL falcon tubes 

(Corning®, 430052) with the recovered cell suspension were kept cooled in crushed ice.

Afterwards, in a certified cell culture laboratory, the cell suspension previously collected was 

centrifuged during 10 minutes at 1100 rpm and 4ºC in a Heracus multifuge centrifuge (1 L-R, 

certified by Certilab). The following procedures were done in a dedicated laminar flow 

chamber in sterile conditions. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended 

adding the complete culture medium RPMI-1640 [Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium 

(Sigma, R8758), 10% of FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma, F7524), 1% L-Glutamine 

(Sigma, G7513), 1% antibiotic Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, Sigma, A5955)]. 

As it has been mentioned, all the procedures described in this chapter were carried out in a cell 

culture room, in sterile conditions in a laminar flow chamber.  

In fact, the main goal of cell cultures, the cultivation and propagation of disperse cells, requires 

the establishment of strict aseptic and sterile conditions. 

Both cell lines, peritoneal macrophages and human fibroblasts, are adherent cell lines and both 

are maintained at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a Binder incubator (06-10960 

verified by Certilab).  

The peritoneal macrophages were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium and human fibroblasts were 

propagated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, DMEM (Sigma, D5648) supplemented 

with 15% of FBS; 1% of antibiotic (Pen/Strep) and 1% L-Glutamine. 

The peritoneal macrophages were placed in culture, at first, in 6-well flat bottom microplates 

(Costar®, Corning Incorporation, 3516) with approximately 1 mL of complete RPMI-1640. 

This was done to separate macrophages (adherent cells) from other blood cells harvested 

simultaneously, which are non-adherent. After 24 hours, if there were no experiments to

perform, macrophages should be frozen in a -80ºC chamber (ThermoScientific, Herafreeze, 

HFU TSeries), since they do not divide in vitro. An image of the macrophages and the human 

fibroblasts used in this work is represented in Figures 21 and 22, respectively.

To detach macrophages from the wells the supernatant was discarded. Then, with gentle 

circular motions the bottom of each well was scraped with a sterile scraper and macrophages 

were collected using approximately 1 mL of complete RPMI-1640 added to the well. After 

that, the suspension was collected with a Gilson pipette, using always sterile tips and inside 

the laminar flow chamber, to a sterile falcon and centrifuged (1100 rpm, 4ºC). Inside the 

laminar flow chamber, the supernatant was discarded and a new volume (usually 1 mL) of 

complete culture medium was added to re-suspend the pellet.  An aliquot of 10 mL of the cell 

suspension was taken to a sterile eppendorf. In order to count the number of viable cells 10 µL 

of Trypan Blue at 4% (Sigma, T8154) were added and the mixture was observed, in a Neubauer 

chamber (Marienfeld, 0610030), with an contrast phase optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse, 

TS100) coupled to a photo camera (Nikon Coolpix, S400), see Figures 23 and 24. The number 

of cells was recorded on the label of the cryopreservation tubes (Sarstedt, 72380992). These 

cryopreservation tubes can take up to 1.6 mL.

In order to increase the number of viable cells during cryopreservation, 10% of the volume of 

the suspension placed in each tube of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma, D2650) was added. 

Finally the identified tubes were kept in a dedicated freezer at -80ºC. Macrophages were kept 

in these conditions until a maximum of 2-3 weeks, and afterwards transferred to a liquid 

nitrogen chamber (-190ºC) (ThermoNorma, Cryoplus 1). 

Human fibroblasts used in these in vitro studies were cultured in 75 cm2 flasks (Corning®, 

4314640) with complete DMEM 5% (DMEM, 5% of FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, 1% antibiotic 

Pen/Strep). They had to be transferred from the flasks of 75 cm2, when they reached confluence 

into new flasks by an enzymatic method. Fibroblasts were incubated at 37ºC with 3-4 mL of a 

trypsin 0.25 % solution (BioWest, L0930-100), during the necessary time to become detached 

from the bottom of the flask. About 1 mL of culture medium was added to the flask in order to 

inactivate the enzymatic reaction. The cellular suspension was collected to a sterile 15 mL 

falcon tubes and centrifuged as previously referred. Human fibroblasts can also be frozen with 

a similar protocol, but they need to be kept sooner at -190ºC in a liquid nitrogen chamber.

4.3  Tests with scaffolds 

These studies, as previously referred, intend to evaluate the influence of the addition of HA to 

pure PCL regarding the interaction between cells and scaffolds, and also to evaluate the 

influence of different types and percentages of HA. Additionally, these studies also intended 

to assess the effect of pore size and geometry on the biological properties of the analyzed 

scaffolds. Finally, scaffolds whose surface was modified by plasma treatment were also tested. 

All the scaffolds used in this work were produced at IPL (Instituto Politécnico de Leiria) by 

qualified people. 

 

4.3.1  Preparation of PCL-HA mixtures  

For the development of a scaffold for TE some aspects must be considered, namely the easiness 

and flexibility of production, and characteristics like biocompatibility, bioactivity and 

osteoconductivity. As discussed before, HA satisfies these requirements. Despite these 

favorable characteristics, the mechanical strength of HA (which is very brittle) and the 

difficulty to manufacture complex structures are some of the main drawbacks of this material. 

On the other hand PCL, being equally biocompatible, fully meet these processing requests. 

Thus, composite scaffolds of PCL and HA lead, in principle, to an improvement of both 

biological and mechanical properties of the scaffolds. Additionally, it is expected that the 

mixture of HA to PCL, besides modulating the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the composite, 

also improve the adsorption of specific proteins that help to regulate cellular adhesion and 

proliferation [127]. Studies involving polymers reinforced with hydroxyapatite showed that the 

incorporation of HA in different amounts allows the modulation of the composite elasticity.  

As also pointed out earlier, the present work aims to compare the biologic performance of 

scaffolds produced with two types of HA (synthetic and natural), in the same conditions. For 

the production of composite scaffolds four different PCL-based mixtures were initially 

prepared using different types and percentages of HA (synthetic and natural HA with 10% or 

25% of HA by weight).  

In Figure 25 the different scaffolds compositions and the four architectures tested for each one 

of the compositions, are summarized.  



Chapter 4 – Experimental 

 

56 

These mixtures were prepared by melt blending, dispersing the HA particles in a PCL solution. 

The solution preparation consists of the addition of PCL to a solvent mixture of chloroform 

and methanol (3:1) with 1% (w/v) of oleic acid, to promote the dispersion. Small portions of 

HA were added to this solution, which was heated and in constant agitation through a hot 

plate/magnetic stirrer. When the mixture was complete and uniform, it was placed in a plate 

for solvent evaporation during approximately 24 hours. Then, the mixture was placed in 

vacuum to eliminate any solvent residue. The solid mixture was fragmented into pellets to 

enable its placing into the deposit compartment on the BioExtruder. 

 
 

 

 

 

The used PCL [CAPA 6500 from Perstorp (UK)] has a molecular mass of 50 000 g/mol. 

Synthetic hydroxyapatite with an average particle size of 4 µm was purchase from Altakitin 

(Aveiro, Portugal), while natural hydroxyapatite was obtained thought the calcination of 

bovine bones at 600ºC. Both natural and synthetic hydroxyapatite had identical average 

particle sizes.

and synthetic HA, respectively.

4.3.2  Scaffolds architectural design  

Besides studying the possible influence that different types and percentages of HA can have in 

cell adhesion and proliferation, the present study also intended to evaluate the influence of the 

size and geometry of the pores. Structures with different architectures were prepared to achieve 

this goal: two different pore sizes, 300 and 600 µm, and two different geometries (deposition 

angles), 0/45º and 0/90º were used.  

 

4.3.3  Scaffolds characterizing techniques 

The produced scaffolds were previously characterized to evaluate their thermal behavior and 

porosity as described below.  

 

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)4 

The thermal behavior of the matrices tested was assessed by TGA using a TA Instrument SDT 

Q600. From these results it is possible to determine the effective weight percentage of PCL in 

the composite scaffolds, as well the degradation temperature of the polymer. The mass loss of 

the samples as a function of temperature was observed between room temperature and 600ºC, 

for each composition. Samples were analysed in triplicate. 

 

Porosity5 

The porosity of each scaffold was evaluated using the following methodology: 

? the weight of the scaffold was measured; 

? the dimensions of the scaffold (with the geometry of a square prism and the stander 

dimensions of 2×2×0.1 cm) were rigorously measured  with the help of a ruler 

(length and width) and a micrometer (height)  and its volume was calculated; 

? the apparent density of the scaffold, ?* , was calculated according to the following 

equation: 

                                                 
4,5 These techniques were done by Doutora Patricia Coimbra at the Chemical Engineering Department 

of Coimbra University.

where m represents the mass of the scaffold in grams and V corresponds to the volume of the

Finally, the porosity was calculated applying the following mathematical equation:

where ? (g/cm3)  is the density of PLC or of the PCL/HA mixture, determined experimentally 

in a helium pycnometer ( AccuPyc Pyknometer 1330, micromeritics). 

 

Low pressure plasma treatment 

Although PCL has good biocompatibility and structural stability, it demonstrates low surface 

energy, which together with the absence of bioactive functional groups on PCL surface create 

an interference with cells affinity and subsequent cellular interaction [128].   

To enhance bioactive properties of pure PCL scaffolds, surface modification techniques can 

be used. Plasma surface modification is one of these techniques and has the advantage of 

altering surface properties without changing the bulk behavior of the scaffolds and is free of 

residual solvents over the scaffold surface [128], as referred in Chapter 3. For plasma treatments, 

the exact control of the process conditions, such as working gas, time of reaction and pressure 

in the plasma chamber, allows high surface homogeneity [129].  

For the plasma surface modification experiments, a laboratory and small-scale production 

plasma system FEMTO (low pressure plasma) was used. This equipment was manufactured 

by Diener Electronics (Germany), with a stainless steel plasma chamber of 100 mm of diameter 

and 270 mm of length [127,129]. The scaffolds were placed in the plasma chamber at ? 80 mm 

from the electrode and oxygen (O2) was purged into the chamber. The chamber was kept at 

400 mTorr through vacuum pump, during 3 minutes. The plasma generated modified the 3D 

scaffolds surface.

Cytotoxicity assays 

For this study a cell suspension with ? 5 × 104 cells/mL in culture medium for peritoneal 

macrophages and a cell suspension with ? 1.3 × 104  cells/mL for human fibroblasts were 

necessary. The scaffolds used for these assays were cut into circular blocks, with 1 mm of 

height and a diameter of 11 mm, to be inserted in 48-well microplates (Costar®, Corning 

Incorporation, 3548). The scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide. 

Inside the laminar flow chamber, in sterile conditions, the prepared suspensions were 

distributed by the 48-well microplates according to the pre-selected disposition of the scaffolds 

disks, with a final volume of 300 µL per well.  The suspensions were directly deposited on the 

scaffolds in the following way (see Figure 26): 

? 150 µL of the suspension of peritoneal macrophages plus 150 µL of complete RPMI 

10%; 

? 150 µL of the suspension of human fibroblasts plus 150 µL of complete DMEM 15%; 

? 150 µL of the suspension of peritoneal macrophages plus 150 µL of the suspension of 

human fibroblasts; 

? wells containing only cells and culture medium, without scaffolds, were used as control 

groups. 

 

Figure 36: Representation of one of the used 48-well microplates. 

 



Chapter 4 – Experimental 

 

60 

For the case of co-culture, the same suspension of peritoneal macrophages and fibroblasts were 

used, leading to a proportion of ? 1 fibroblast per 5 peritoneal macrophages. This proportion 

was used since, as previously mentioned, macrophages do not divide in vitro contrarily to what 

happens with fibroblasts.  

Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were evaluated at 72 hours, for all scaffolds compositions, 

in the same conditions, through the MTT assay (Chapter 3).  

To assess cell proliferation, always in sterile conditions, the culture medium was discarded and 

270 µL of culture medium and 30 µL of MTT (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma, M2128) were added to each 

well of the assay. After four hours of incubation in the dark, at 37ºC, with 5% CO2 and at 95% 

relative humidity, the MTT was aspirated and the blue crystals were solubilized in 300 µL per 

well of a 0.04M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) (Sigma-Aldrich®, H1758 ) in isopropanol 

(Sigma-Aldrich®, 278475). After 15 minutes, the absorbance was measured with an ELISA 

spectrophotometer, using a wavelength of 570 nm and a reference length of 620 nm [130].

4.4  Tests with endodontic materials  

As previously mentioned, the tests with these materials comprise both in vitro and in vivo 

tests. 

 

4.4.1  In vitro cytotoxicity studies  

These studies have as main goal to determine which of the three tested materials is less 

cytotoxic hence more biocompatible. For this purpose, it was decided to study the influence 

that different volumes of the tested materials might have in the cytotoxicity and to compare 

the biologic behavior of the different materials for two lengths of time: 72 and 120 hours. 

These studies have been done with macrophages, fibroblasts and co-culture of macrophages 

and fibroblasts. 

Initially, it was decided to compare the results obtained with fresh and with frozen 

macrophages in order to confirm if the chosen freezing protocol did not modify the biologic 

behavior (cell-material interaction) of the macrophages.  

Two different volumes (0.02 mL and 0.03 mL) of AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow® 2 and of the 

“improved” GuttaFlow® were used (see Figure 27). The volume of materials were primarily 

placed in the wells of a 96-well microplate, with the help of a 1 mL syringe with a 21G × 1½’’, 

0.8 × 40 mm, needle (T Terumos® Neolus, NN-2138R), and only then the cells suspensions 

were added to the wells. A cell suspension of 6 × 104 fresh macrophages/mL and another of 

6 × 104 frozen macrophages/mL were used.  

To thaw the frozen macrophages, the containing cryopreservation tubes were heated during 1 

to 2 minutes in a water bath at 37ºC (Gesellschaft für, 10485789d). Afterwards, inside the flow 

laminar chamber in sterile conditions, cell suspension was transferred to a sterile falcon, adding 

approximately 2 mL of complete culture medium, RPMI-1640. This falcon was centrifuged 

during 10 minutes, at 4ºC and 1,100 rpm. The supernatant was then removed and the pellet 

resulting of the centrifugation was re-suspended in 1 mL of new complete culture medium. 

Macrophages harvested and isolated on the day prior to the experiment and cultured during 24 

hours are catalogued as fresh macrophages.

Chapter 4 – Experimental 

 

62 

 

 

The results obtained in this part of the study demonstrate that the biologic behavior of frozen 

macrophages is similar to the one of the fresh macrophages, as observed in Chapter 5. In this 

context the following assays were only done with frozen macrophages. Furthermore, the results 

of this study also demonstrate that there are not significant differences between the results 

obtained with 0.02 and with 0.03 mL of each one of the materials.  

Thus, later studies were carried out as previously referred with frozen macrophages, fibroblasts 

and co-culture of fibroblasts and frozen macrophages. For the case of co-culture, the proportion 

of cells used was ? 1 fibroblast per 10 frozen macrophages (1:10). A cell suspension of 6 ×

103fibroblasts/mL and a cell suspension of 6 × 104 frozen macrophages/mL was used. The 

concentration of each cell suspension used in co-culture was the same as that used for each 

type of cell per itself.  

In order to study the influence of the volume of material in the interaction between the referred 

cell lines and endodontic materials, two different volumes (0.01 mL and 0.02 mL) of AH Plus 

JetTM, GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow® were used. These volumes of each one 

of the materials were placed in different wells of a 96-well microplate (Costar®, Corning 

Incorporation, 3596), according to a pre-selected disposition. Then 150 µL of each one of the 

three prepared cell suspensions were placed in the different wells of the microplates, being 

directly deposited on materials, as pre-selected. These volumes of material (0.01 and 0.02 mL) 

were chosen trying to mimic the volumes used for the endodontic procedures. These volumes 

Figure 27: Arrangement of the samples in a 96-well microplate, for the study performed with frozen and fresh 
macrophages for AH Plus JetTM. The wells disposition for GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” Guttaflow®, 

is the same. 

 



Chapter 4 – Experimental

are also chosen because they are the smallest volumes that are possible to measure with a 

syringe with a certain confidence degree, due to the fluidity of the endodontic materials.  

Since GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow® have Gutta-percha in their composition, 

and AH Plus JetTM is always used in combination with a solid support in clinic, it was also 

decided to perform tests with 0.01 and 0.02 mL of AH Plus JetTM in combination with small 

pieces of Gutta-percha cones, in the presence of frozen macrophages, fibroblasts and their co-

culture.   

In all the tests that were performed, wells containing only cells and culture medium, without 

endodontic materials, were used as control groups. When it was intended to study the behavior 

of AH Plus JetTM in combination with small pieces of Gutta-percha cones, wells containing 

cells, small pieces of Gutta-percha cones and culture medium were also used as control groups.  

In Table 3 the different groups that were established during the development of this study are 

summarized. 

The cytotoxicity of the three endodontic sealers tested was evaluated at 72 and 120 hours of 

incubation. These times were chosen because, as previously referred, macrophages do not 

divide in vitro, several toxic products are accumulated in the culture medium and cells start to 

die after 120 hours of incubation. 

To assess cell proliferation, the culture medium was discarded and 135 µL of culture medium 

and 15 µL of MTT (0.5 mg/mL) were added to all wells of the assay. After four hours of 

incubation in the dark, at 37ºC, in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 95% relative humidity, 

the MTT was removed and the purple bluish crystals were solubilized in 150 µL per well of a 

0.04 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in isopropanol. After 15 minutes, the absorbance 

was measured with an ELISA spectrophotometer, using a wavelength of 570 nm and a 

reference standard of 620 nm [130].

As in the study with scaffolds, all these procedures were undertaken in a cell culture room, in 

sterile conditions inside a laminar flow chamber, using sterile material, and the gloves and all 

enclosure being previously disinfected with alcohol at 75%. 

 

4.4.2  In vivo cytotoxicity studies  
 

Although cell culture studies are relevant, when the final goal is the in vivo implantation, the 

obtained in vitro results cannot be directly extrapolated to the clinic, being necessary to resort 

to animal models, since in vitro assays cannot reproduce the in vivo anatomy and physiology. 

Wistar rats are the most used animals in laboratory research worldwide, since they are 

mammals and their body temperature (?37ºC), physiology, anesthesia/drug administration is 

similar to humans. 

Additionally, they are homoeothermic and regulate their body temperature by generating heat 

through metabolic processes and heat loss control. Heat loss is reduced by a thick fur cover 

and a layer of subcutaneous fat. In addition they are cost “effective” and easy to house, feed, 

breed and manipulate. 

During these studies, some humanitarian critical limits have been taken into account as, for 

example, discomfort signs or severe pain, weight loss higher than 15% of the initial weight, 

respiratory difficulties and posture and motor activity changes [131].    



Chapter 4 – Experimental 

 

66 

Experimental protocol 

For the in vivo assays 20 Wistar rats, adult females, were used with weights ranging between 

120 and 260 grams.  

The study comprised two different time periods, 8 and 30 days. The inflammatory response of 

the following materials was studied:  AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” 

GuttaFlow®. The ultimate goal is to compare the behavior of the latter, not yet marketed, with 

the first two already available. 

The evaluation was assessed by routine histological study, using optical microscopy. All the 

materials were implanted in all the animals, in distinct points of subcutaneous cellular tissue 

as described later (page 67).  

  

Anesthesia 

A combination of Ketamine 50 mg (Ketalar®, Cetamina Pfizer, 8276907) and chlorpromazine 

5mg/mL (Largactil®, Laboratórios Vitória, 9977827) (3:10) i.m. was used. This combination 

was administrated in the thigh, via intramuscular (i.m.), with a dosage of 0.3 mL per 100 g of 

body weight. 

 

Preparation of the chirurgic site and materials implantation 

Trichotomy of the involved areas in the intervention was done, in 4 dorsum quadrants, at level 

of right and left scapular and right and left pelvic regions (Figure 29). The animal was 

positioned in ventral decubitus. Then, the disinfection of the trichotomized areas was carried 

out with a dermal solution of iodine polyvidone (Egrema, Paracelsia, 0670). The surgical 

procedure was performed inside a laminar flow chamber, and all surgical equipment 

(scalpel+blade 11, scissors, tweezers, needle holder, sutures) was sterile. The skin incisions (4 

per animal) were done in a selected point of each quadrant, and a loca was created by blunt 

dissection of the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The studied materials were placed inside 18 GA, 

1.3 mm ×  48 mm, abocath tubes (BD InsyteTM, 381247) with 8 mm long just prior to 



Chapter 4 – Experimental 

 

67 

implantation. This procedure was done in sterile conditions in another flow laminar chamber, 

using gloves and sterile material.  

The materials were implanted in all the animals as represented in Figure 29: 

 

Figure 29: Anatomical localization of the implantation of the studied materials. 

 

The interventions were finalized with closure of operatory wounds, using non-resorbable 

suture material, silk 4/0. All enclosures of used materials were previously disinfected with 

alcohol at 75% before going inside the laminar flow chamber. 

 

Post-operatory and control along time  

At the end of surgery the animal was harmed up and monitored until awaking. Animals were 

kept in cages (an animal per cage), inside a temperature, light and in &amp;amp; out air flow controlled 

cabinet (Tecniplast, 9ARMI/4120). Animals were provided with proper food and water ad 

libitum, and bedding was changed once or twice a week, as needed. Animals were checked 

daily and weighted (Seca, model 734, serie 1/1) once a week. 

 

Euthanasia  

At the end of each period (8 and 30 days), animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 

according to the procedure described in Annex II of the Portuguese Law Decree nº 113/2013, 

August, 7th.  



Chapter 4 – Experimental 

 

68 

Necropsy and harvests 

The weight of the animals was registered every 8 days. They were placed in ventral decubitus 

over an absorbent material. The location of the implants was searched by tactile sensitivity and 

trichotomy of the areas was re-done. Then the chirurgic removal of the implants was done (see 

Figure 30), with a wide safety margin of surrounding tissue.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The collected materials were photographed and immediately fixed in pre-identified laboratory 

cassettes (see Figure 31) for Anatomical Pathology routine processing by immersion in 

buffered formaldehyde at 10% (Sigma, 252549) (usually a volume 40 times larger than the 

samples). Containers were placed at 4ºC for at least 48 hours. Routine processing was 

performed [109] for inclusion in paraplast (Sigma, P3568) and further histologic studies.

Histology 

Samples were prepared for the histological study at the Laboratory of Experimental Pathology 

of the Dentistry Department of the Medicine Faculty of the University of Coimbra.  

In what concerns the histological preparation of the implants with surrounding tissue, they 

were fixed by immersion in neutral buffered formaldehyde at 10% (as referred in the previously 

topic). Following fixation, each tissue sample has been placed in an alcohol water solution, 

beginning with 60% alcohol and progressing in graded steps to 100% alcohol, in order to 

remove the water content. Then, the alcohol was replaced by xylene (Sigma-Aldrich, 534056), 

and in a next step xylene was replaced by paraplast (Sigma, P3568) (overnight at 56ºC). The 

samples were included in paraplast to make blocks, using a dedicated equipment. Finally, the 

tissue blocks were cut into thin sections (5 ?m of thickness), using a microtome (Leica RM 

2155, Leica, Portugal) with disposable knives. The sections were, then, mounted on individual 

microscope slides (previously coated with a liquid adhesive and dried), using a black 

background water bath at 37ºC. Afterwards, the microscope slides were placed in a store tray, 

in order to dry in incubator at 37ºC.  

The hematoxylin and eosin routine histologic coloring technique has been done in order to 

enable optical microscopy observation. Since the dyes are aqueous, the paraplast was removed 

with several steps of xylene, followed by a grading sequence of alcohols (from absolute ethanol 

to 60%). The sections were washed with tap water and were finally stained with Aldrich 

hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, MHS1). Dye excess was removed with tap water and 

counterstaining was done with eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, HT110280) [109]. In order to obtain long 

lasting preparations, the sections have to be protected with a glass coverslip. The mounting 

media are not water soluble, hence the removal of water with an upgrading sequence of alcohol 

baths and xylene. After drying over night at room temperature or in the incubator at 37ºC for 

a short period of time, sections were ready to be observed with an optical microscope and to 

obtain digital photos using a dedicated computer program.

4.5  Statistical analysis  

In order to study the scaffolds, Kruskal-Wallis test was applied with adjusted pairwise 

comparisons to evaluate possible differences in MTT values due to different types and 

percentages of HA and different architectures (pore geometry and size). All the “p values” 

were obtained using the software IBM® SPSS® Statistic, version 22 (IBM Corporation, 

Armonk, New York, EUA). 

In order to analyze the influence of the different parameters under study two different softwares 

were used. Initially MiniTab, (version 18), was used, however, as this software is normally 

only adequate when there are a large volume of data, the software Statistic Data Mining, 

version 10.0 (Dell Software) was used to try to confirm the previously obtained results with 

MiniTab.    

Regarding the analysis of the cytotoxicity data of endodontic sealers, all the analysis were done 

with SPSS, applying the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test.

Results and discussion 
 

As referred in Chapter 4, this work has two main objectives: 

i) assessing the biological performance/cytotoxicity of scaffolds for tissue 

regeneration; 

ii) assessing the cytotoxicity of three different endodontic cements in order to study 

the behavior of a new endodontic material in comparison with two other materials 

already on the market.  

Both studies have been done using macrophages, fibroblasts and their co-culture.  

In what concerns the first objective, the results analysis is done in order to evaluate the 

influence that scaffolds’ architecture and composition have in cell adhesion and proliferation. 

It is important to note that the higher the cell adhesion and proliferation the smaller the 

cytotoxicity of the scaffolds is.  

The aim of the analysis of the results of the second goal consists on assessing the in vitro 

cytotoxic effect of the three endodontic materials tested in this work (AH Plus JetTM, 

GuttaFlow® 2 and an “improved” GuttaFlow®), in order to evaluate the cytotoxic behavior of 

the new endodontic cement, the “improved” GuttaFlow®. 

 

5.1  In vitro studies with scaffolds 

In the literature, there are several references to the use of some biodegradable synthetic 

polymers in the field of biomedical engineering as they are ease to process, and due their 

mechanical and physical properties, low toxicity, low immunogenicity and low risk of 

infections.  

The most widely used synthetic polymer is PCL (polycaprolactone), which is a linear aliphatic 

polyester, hydrophobic, biocompatible and biodegradable, with a melting temperature of            

? 60ºC. It also has high processability and high thermal stability. However, despite all these 



Chapter 5 – Results and discussion 

 

72 

advantages, the use of PCL in scaffolds’ fabrication is limited due to its hydrophobic character. 

Thus, in this field, PCL has been used in the preparation of composites based on ceramic 

materials, in order to improve the mechanical strength, osteocompatibility/osteoconductivity 

and implant degradation rate. 

Since the requirement of scaffolds can vary according to the cell type, it is necessary to ensure 

that the design and the production of porous structures are sufficiently flexible to accommodate 

and promote the growth of specific cell lines. Besides, the cell colonization process of scaffolds 

is highly dependent on the ability that cells have to build bridges between the pores and to 

migrate into the interior of scaffolds. It is known that a scaffold with an interconnected pore 

structure with appropriate pore size and distribution should facilitate the attachment and the 

proliferation of cells necessary for a complete tissue regeneration.  

In order to evaluate all these factors, it was programmed to study the influence that different 

percentages (10 and 25%) and different types of HA - natural HA (HA N) and synthetic HA 

(HA S) - have in cell adhesion and proliferation within scaffolds. Two different cell lines, 

macrophages and fibroblasts, and their co-culture have been selected. Furthermore, the 

scaffolds that were used also had different architectures trying to evaluate the influence that 

the pore size and geometry might have in the interaction between cells and scaffolds (Figures 

32-34).  

In Figures 32-34 the obtained results for each one of the studied cells are represented.  

Through the analysis of the results in these figures it is possible to see a clear influence of the 

pore architecture in the obtained results. The higher the intensity in the microplate reader, 

which is shown in the y-axis of the graphs, the higher is the number of living cells within the 

scaffolds. The obtained results suggest an increased number of metabolically active cells for 

pores of 300 µm and a geometry of 0/45º compared to the 0/90º one. Only for two of the 

analyzed compositions (HA S 25% 600 µm and HA N 10% 300 µm) better results were 

obtained with a geometry of 0/90º.

Using SPSS (IBM, version 2.2) it was possible to confirm these conclusions, since the obtained 

results show statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.01) for the pore size (300 vs 600 µm) and 

also for the geometry (0/45º vs 0/90º). The fact that cells prefer pores of 300 µm can be 

correlated with a better reproduction of what happens in vivo. The effective distance between 

cells and blood vessels in vivo are of the order of the 200-250 µm. In the literature a pore size 

around of 150-500 µm has been reported to facilitate vascularization and enable a good 

penetration of cells to promote the growth of new tissue [3,13]

Observing the results in Table 4, regarding the scaffolds’ porosity, based on gravimetric 

measurements, the architecture 300 µm 0/45º is the one presenting the lowest porosity values. 

However, these results do not clarify if cells migrate to the interior of the scaffolds or if they 

mainly adhere to the surface. Such a conclusion could be achieved after viewing the respective 

scaffolds using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) technology which has not been possible 

to do until the moment.

Observing Figures 32-34 it is also possible to see that independently of the architecture of the 

scaffolds, the results of the MTT assay show that the number of metabolic active cells for 

PCL/HA scaffolds was higher than for pure PCL scaffolds. This confirms the need to add a 

bioactive ceramic to the PCL. Although PCL is a biocompatible, biodegradable and easily

processable material, it has low ability to promote cell adhesion, proliferation and 

differentiation, mainly due to its hydrophobic characteristics. Moreover, PCL has low 

bioactivity, which limits the ability of the structures to recruit cells from surrounding tissues 

(when implanted in vivo), as well as the ability to promote cell adhesion, proliferation and 

differentiation in vitro. The superior biocompatibility of the PCL/HA scaffolds may result from 

the gradual dissolution of the incorporated HA particles into calcium and phosphate ions, 

which can help to regulate the behavior of the nearby cells.   

Comparing the results obtained for each one of the cell types for each composition and 

architecture of the scaffolds, it can be observed that in most cases the higher values of MTT 

were obtained for fibroblasts. A possible justification could be the fact that fibroblasts are cells 

larger than macrophages, therefore occupying a larger surface area than the latter. In the case 

of co-culture, the presence of fibroblasts can difficult the adhesion of macrophages, even 

though care has been taken to seed macrophages immediately prior to fibroblasts. Furthermore, 

in contrast to fibroblasts, macrophages do not divide in vitro. This last factor was, however, 

taken into consideration during the experimental assay, having been used (as mentioned in 

page 60) a proportion of 1 fibroblast per 5 macrophages.  

In order to investigate the impact and the magnitude of each factor in cellular response (MTT 

value) and the interaction between these factors, the experiments using scaffolds with HA were 

carried out following a design of experiments (DOE) of factorial type. DOE is a test, or series 

of tests, where intentional changes are made to the variables of a process in order to measure 

the responses of the process. The main goal of the DOE encompasses determining which 

variables have more influence on the response of the process. There are several types of DOE’s, 

the one chosen for this analysis was the 24 design with four replicas per point. This means that 

there are four independent variables (factors) – pore, geometry, percentage of HA (HA %) and 

type of HA – studied at two levels, designated by low and high, and each point of the design 

has four replicas.  

Table 5 shows the parameters used in DOE. The design layout, generated by the software 

miniTab is presented in appendix 1.

Based on the DOE it was possible to adjust the results to a linear model (appendix 1) and to 

generate several graphs including Pareto Charts, Figures 35 to 37. In these graphs all the 

effects that exceed the line corresponding to a 2.01 value, are statistically significant. Thus, it 

can be seen that, regardless of the cell type used in this assay, the C factor (pore size) is the 

factor that most influences the obtained MTT values. The effect of C is about 5 to 10 times 

higher than the effect of the other factors. Although the MTT values for the percentage of HA 

and pore geometry are also significant, they had lower effects comparatively to the pore size 

factor. In this assay, the C factor (pore size) is the factor that most influences the obtained MTT 

values. Between the factors B and D, the most significant is factor D. Regarding the A factor 

(type of HA), it seems that it is the least significant of the four analyzed factors, being 

negligible for macrophages. The Pareto Charts obtained for each one of the studied cells types 

are represented in Figures 35 to 37. 

Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that the scaffolds architecture, C and D factors, 

has more influence than the others analyzed factors, on the interaction between cells and 

scaffolds, which can be seen in the following three figures (Figures 35 to 37). This is in 

accordance with what was concluded based on previous results, and with what is reported in 

the literature, since the scaffolds colonization process is highly dependent on the ability of cells 

to build bridges between the pores. If the pore size is not adequate (too big or too small) cells 

will not have the ability to migrate and colonize the scaffolds in a homogeneous way.

Figure 37: Pareto Chart for the case of co-culture. 

             

As previously seen, the addition of HA to PCL significantly improves the MTT values, but this 

analysis also reveals that, being present, the type (synthetic HA or natural HA) and the 

percentage in which it is present (10% or 25%) have little influence on the results. However, 

this does not mean that the HA type is not important to the interaction of the scaffolds with 

other cells like osteoblasts, as well as for in vivo studies. Perhaps in these cases the effects of 

this factor will be statistically significant, but relying on the performed studies no conclusions 

can be drawn. The same can be concluded about the percentage of HA in the scaffolds, which 

surely will have a great influence on the mechanical properties and in the rate of in vivo 

degradation.

The effect of the interactions between factors are also significant, thought their influence when 

compared with the effect of factor C is also small.  

The analysis using SPSS and miniTab led to the same conclusions.  

Figures 38 to 40 represent the main effects in the MTT values and their degree of influence. 

These figures confirm what was previously said about the influence of the factors. Observing 

the Figures 38-40 it is clear that the factors C and D (pore and geometry, respectively) are the 

factors that most influence the obtained results. By the slope of the line it is possible to see the 

influence that the different variables have in the MTT values. For example, the slope of the 

first graph on the Figures 38-40 is very small and positive, which indicates that HA N provides 

a slightly better interaction between cells and scaffolds (better MTT results), compared with 

HA S, but this difference is very small. In fact, the Pareto Charts indicate that this difference 

is not statistically significant both for fibroblasts and macrophages.  

Concerning the percentage of HA, the increase from 10% to 25% results in a small increase of 

the MTT values. The results obtained regarding the pore and geometry are in accordance with 

the  previous conclusions.

Figure 40: Main effects that influence cellular interactions with scaffolds for the co-culture. 

 

As it is possible to see in the Pareto Charts in Figures 35 to 37, the interaction between factors 

also has significant effects in the results, although their influence is less significant than the 

one of C factor. Figures 38 to 40 represent the influence of each one of the interactions that 

occurred during the experiments. For example, observing the graph relative to the interaction 

between factors A and B (type and percentage of HA) - (first graph of Figures 38 to 40), and 

considering the combined results for macrophages, fibroblasts and their co-culture, it can be 

observed that the percentage of HA has a positive effect in the MTT values, being more 

significant (therefore having a greater effect) for HA S than for HA N. Analyzing the graphs 

of the Figures 35 to 37, it can be seen that only the interaction BD (interaction between the 

percentage of HA and the geometry) is always statistically significant, and that the effect of 

the geometry is more significant for the percentage of 10% of HA than for 25%.  

In order to try to understand the interactions, the software Statistic (version 10.0) was used, 

allowing to evaluate the interaction between the four factors in study.  

As it can be seen in the graphs of Figures 41 and 42, the percentage of HA for the geometry of 

0/45º has a statistically significant effect but the same effect is not as significant for the 

geometry 0/90º.  

Likewise, the results are always better for pores of 300 µm as previously concluded. This can 

be correlated to the fact that scaffolds with a geometry of 0/45º and 300 µm provide a larger 

surface area than pores of 600 µm and 0/90º.   

 



Chapter 5 – Results and discussion

Observing Figures 43 and 44, it seems that the four cases have significant differences in their 

results, although the major differences occur for the geometry of 0/45º and a pore of 300 µm, 

which is in accordance with Figures 41 and 42. 

In appendix 2, 3 and 4 the graphs relatives to normal probability for macrophages, fibroblasts 

and co-culture response are represented. 

In order to improve cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation within scaffolds, two 

different types of scaffolds were submitted to an oxygen-based plasma modification. These 

two types of scaffolds were chosen based on the previous results. Thus, the architecture that 

provides better results (300 µm, 0/45º) was first chosen. The chosen scaffolds’ compositions 

were pure PCL and PCL-HA S with 10% of HA S by weight. The main goal of this experiment 

was to try to evaluate if a plasma treatment would improve the scaffolds’ surface bioactivity. 

Furthermore, based on the obtained results, it was also possible to compare the effect of the 

composition and the geometry on MTT results after the plasma treatment.

Observing Figures 45 to 47, it is possible to conclude that the most significant factor is the 

geometry, which means that the geometry of the scaffolds has more influence in the metabolic 

cell activity than the plasma treatment, independently of the cell type that was used. This means 

that, although the plasma treatment increased the surface hydrophilicity, the total amount of 

oxygen containing groups and the total surface energy of the scaffolds, a good pore geometry 

and interconnectivity continues to be essential for the success of the cell-scaffold interaction.

As referred in page 72 a scaffold with interconnected pore structure should improve the 

attachment and cell proliferation for a complete in vivo tissue regeneration.   

In these figures (Figures 45 to 47) it can be observed that the scaffolds composition, 

specifically, the presence or not of HA also has more influence in the results than the plasma 

treatment. This reflects the high requirement to add HA particles to PCL, in order to increase 

the bioactivity of the composite scaffolds compared to the scaffolds of pure PCL.  

 

As demonstrated in Figure 47, for the co-culture all the parameters are statistically significant.  

In Figures 48 to 50 the interactions between factors after plasma treatment are represented. As 

it is possible to be seen, the plasma treatment has a major effect to the geometry of 0/45º, since

composition of the scaffolds, B to the Plasma treatment and C to the scaffolds geometry.

these pores enable a better air penetration than the pores with a geometry of 0/90º, and there is 

a higher surface area available for the modification.

In these figures (Figure 48 to 50) it is also possible to see that the plasma treatment has a greater 

effect for scaffolds of pure PCL, compared to the composite scaffolds of PCL-HA S 10%. This 

is probably due to the fact that HA, unlike PCL, does not interact with the radicals created by 

the plasma treatment.

5.2  In vitro studies with endodontic cements 

The macrophages used for this work are peritoneal macrophages, harvested from Wistar rats 

in IB-IBLI (the same place where the study took place). Using fresh macrophages implies that 

Wistar rats are available at the time of the experiment. Since macrophages do not divide in 

vitro, their harvest should be done on the eve of the programmed experiment. In this context, 

prior work has been done in IBILI to test if fresh and frozen3 macrophages would provide 

reliable and comparable results. 

 Nevertheless, a comparison between the results obtained with fresh and frozen macrophages 

was repeated in order to ensure the results and to facilitate the preparation of future assays.  

Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to calculate ‘p’ value among different test 

groups (p&lt;0.001 indicates a significant difference among different groups).  

Thus, for this assay, two different volumes (0.02 and 0.03 mL) of endodontic material were 

tested. Wells with cells (fresh or frozen macrophages) and culture medium were used as control 

group. The obtained results are represented in Figures 51-53. As it can be seen in these figures 

there are no significant differences between fresh and frozen macrophages, independently of 

the material volume that was used. Thus, the next assays with macrophages could be done 

using frozen macrophages, since freezing does not alter their properties.

Figure 53: Representation of the obtained results for the control group with fresh and frozen macrophages. 

 

In order to study the influence that different volumes of material might have in the interaction 

between cells and the endodontic materials, specifically AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow® 2 and the 

“improved” GuttaFlow®, at 72 hours, three different volumes: 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mL of each 

one of the materials, were tested.  

From the analysis of the obtained results for each one of the volumes it can be seen that for 

0.01 mL, statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) have been found between all the 

materials in study. For the volume of 0.02 mL, statistically significant differences have been 

found between GuttaFlow® 2 and AH Plus JetTM, as well as between GuttaFlow® 2 and the 

“improved” Guttaflow. For tests made with 0.03 mL of the material, statistically significant 

differences only have been found between GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow®.  

However, for each material no statistically significant differences occur between the different 

used volumes. The obtained “p” values are summarized in Table 7.

Chapter 5 – Results and discussion 

 

86 

Based on the previously referred observations, it can be conclude that the used material has 

more influence in the results than the chosen volume.  

During this work, it was also decided to study a possible temporal influence. To this purpose, 

tests during 120 hours were also done. Since for 72 hours no significant differences occurred 

between the different volumes of material that were tested, for 120 hours only two different 

volumes were tested. The chosen volumes were 0.01 and 0.02 mL, since the previously 

obtained results for 0.02 and 0.03 mL were very similar. Moreover, the 0.03 mL would be 

higher than the quantity of the material used in a real endodontic treatment situation.  

Comparing the obtained results for 120 hours with the ones obtained for 72 hours, it is possible 

to conclude that the better results occur for 72 hours, which means that at 120 hours the 

materials appear to be more toxic to cells. The values decreased with time, and it is also 

possible to verify that the greatest (negative) variations occur for the highest volume of the 

material, in this case 0.02 mL (since tests with 0.03 mL were not made at 120 hours). This is 

supported by the literature, since for longer times, increasing the surface of contact between 

the root canal sealer and the medium, the amount of leaching molecules within the medium 

increases and consequently increases the cytotoxicity of the material [133].  

For all the assays that were done until now the “improved” GuttaFlow® shows better MTT 

results than AH Plus JetTM and GuttaFlow® 2, both at 72 and 120 hours.  

Since GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow® have Gutta-percha in a powder form in 

their composition, and AH Plus JetTM in vivo is never used without a core obturation material, 

the behavior of AH Plus JetTM combined with small pieces of Gutta-Percha cones was also 

studied and the results were compared with the ones obtained using only AH Plus JetTM, 

GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow®. The obtained results are represented in Figure 

54 for each one of the used cell types. As it is possible to see in this figure, the obtained results 

for AH Plus JetTM are better than the ones obtained for the set AH Plus JetTM + small pieces of 

Gutta-percha. However, between all the tested materials the “improved” GuttaFlow® continues 

to be the less cytotoxic of the tested materials.   

 



Chapter 5 – Results and discussion 

 

87 

AH Plus JetTM has a complex chemical composition, which is why there are several substances 

that can be released during the polymerization and thereby cause toxic effects. Thus, a possible 

explanation for the cytotoxic character of AH Plus JetTM might be the release of the amine and 

epoxy resin components of the sealer [74]. Besides this, the present amines also can accelerate 

the polymerization of the material. Additionally, despite the manufacturer referring this being 

a “formaldehyde free” material several studies demonstrate that AH Plus JetTM has a small 

percentage of this component in its composition [74,134-136]. This endodontic cement has 

antibacterial effect which can also contribute to the toxic effects [137].  

GuttaFlow® 2 appears to be more cytotoxic than AH Plus JetTM and the “improved” 

GuttaFlow® in these studies. This could be due to some extra-additives of GuttaFlow® 2. It 

contains Gutta-percha powder and micro-silver as a preservative. The Gutta-percha powder 

can have an irritating effect in tissues, and silver according to reported studies has some toxicity 

[74,137-140]. 

Tests during 72 hours were also done with fibroblasts and co-culture of fibroblasts and 

macrophages. In these assays the cytotoxicity of the materials were only tested for two different 

volumes: 0.01 and 0.02 mL. Thus, observing the obtained results for fibroblast and co-culture 

no statistically significant differences can be found between the different materials. 

It is possible to see in Figure 54 that the behavior of the different materials are similar for all 

tested cell types, with single exception of GuttaFlow® 2, which provides much better results 

for the case of co-culture. A hypothesis to explain it could be that GuttaFlow® 2 has properties 

that stimulate the interaction between the material and connective tissue (e.g: fibroblasts).

5.3  In vivo studies with endodontic cements – Histologic study 

As referred in Chapter 4, for the in vivo studies, the materials were implanted in the 

subcutaneous tissue within abocat tubes of 8 mm. For this purpose, four different groups have 

been done. The first group was the control group and consisted in the implantation of empty 

tubes in order to study the reaction of the tissue to their presence. The other three groups 

consisted in the implantation of tubes containing the materials that had been tested: AH Plus 

JetTM, GuttaFlow® 2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow®. These materials had been implanted in 

tubes in order to mimic what happens in clinic, as only the tip of the material contained inside 

the tube can contact with surrounding tissue. 

 

Control 

On the 8th day, no formation of fibrous capsule was observed (Figure 55). It was also observed 

the presence of inflammatory infiltrate. It can thus be concluded that no reaction to the tube 

has occurred. In Figure 56 an image of the skin without the presence of foreign body reaction 

can be observed.

AH Plus JetTM 

Eight days following the subcutaneous implantation of the tubes containing AH Plus JetTM the 

intensity of the inflammatory reaction is milder and the tissue was organized exhibiting the 

formation of connective fibers (Figures 57-58). The microscopic analysis of the tissue-

biomaterial interface showed that AH Plus JetTM was surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule and 

was also possible to observe some inflammatory infiltrate (Figure 59).

GuttaFlow® 2 

Observing Figure 60 and 61, it can be seen that eight days after the subcutaneous implantation 

of the tubes containing GuttaFlow 2 an inflammatory reaction is occurring. In these figures, it 

is also possible to observe a layer of connective tissue with organized collagen fibers.  

The microscopic analysis of the tissue-biomaterial interface showed that GuttaFlow® 2 was 

surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule (Figure 62) more organized than in the case of the tube 

with AH Plus JetTM. New blood vessels were formed around the implantation site (Figures 60-

62).

“Improved” GuttaFlow 

 The microscopic analysis of the tissue-“improved” GuttaFlow interface showed some fibrosis, 

although in the obtained images it is not very evident, as can be seen in Figure 63. Figure 64 

represents the place where the tube with the “improved” GuttaFlow is. In this figure some 

inflammatory infiltrate can be observed, although in a much smaller degree than for the case 

of the other studied materials.   

 

 

 

 

Based on the previous results, it can be concluded that no inflammatory reaction occurs due to 

the presence of the tubes. Thus, the fibrotic capsules that were formed surrounding tubes with 

GuttaFlow® 2 and AH Plus JetTM are due to the presence of these materials. Comparing the 

results obtained for each one of the three tested materials it can be concluded that the highest 

inflammatory reaction occurs in the presence of AH Plus JetTM, and the less inflammatory 

reaction occurs in the presence of the “improved” GuttaFlow®.

with “improved” GuttaFlow® was implanted

fibrousis starts to appear, although it is not 

very evident.

Chapter 6 

Conclusions and future work 
 

In this chapter the main conclusions regarding the obtained results are presented, as well as 

some perspectives for future work. 

 

6.1  Conclusions 

One of the main goals of this work is to determine the effects that the design parameters (pore 

size and geometry) and materials have on scaffolds’ biological properties, specifically in what 

concerns the cytotoxicity. Furthermore, as previously referred, another main goal of this work 

is the study of cytotoxic behavior of three endodontic materials with different compositions, 

in order to determine which of them have better biological properties. The final conclusions of 

this work are then reported, accord to the goals indicated above and explained in detail in 

Chapter 3.  

 

6.1.1  Conclusions of the study with scaffolds for TE  

The fundamental concept of TE predicts the combination of a scaffold with cells or active 

biological molecules in order to obtain a bioimplant able to promote tissue reparation and/or 

regeneration. Thus, the design of scaffolds for TE must obey several mechanical, chemical and 

biological requirements. However, the quantity and the diversity of these requirements increase 

the complexity associated with the scaffolds production. To reduce this complexity, additive 

fabrication technologies, which are able to produce structures with higher geometric precision, 

have emerged. Therefore, in Chapter 2, a detailed revision of the scaffolds’ requirements and 

of the different additive fabrication technologies was made, namely for those that were 

specifically developed for TE. Between the different classes of biomaterials used in TE special 

attention was given to synthetic polymers and ceramic materials, namely to PCL and HA (see 

Chapter 3). PCL and HA are FDA approved materials, that when combined present better 

biological and bioactive properties.  



Chapter 6 – Conclusions and future work 

  

94 

In Chapter 4, the description of the performed procedures has been done and in Chapter 5 a 

detailed analysis of the obtained results was done. Through variation of the pore size and the 

deposition angle, it was possible to obtain scaffolds with different porosities and pore 

architectures. The obtained results allow drawing some conclusions: 

? from the point of cellular adhesion and differentiation, scaffolds with a pore size of 300 

µm and a geometry of 0/45º are those with the best performance; 

? the architecture of 300 µm 0/45º correspond to the architecture with the lowest porosity 

values.  

These results show that scaffolds with lower porosity promote a better interaction between 

cells and scaffolds and consequently, increase the cell adhesion and proliferation. 

Since the MTT assay is a qualitative measure of mitochondrial function, it has been used as a 

measure of cytotoxicity. This assay considers that the number of active living cells is inversely 

proportional to the cytotoxicity value. Thus, it can be concluded that the higher the number of 

active cells that adhere and proliferate within the scaffolds, the lower is the cytotoxicity of the 

scaffold. Therefore, it can be concluded that the scaffold’s architecture with a pore size of 300 

µm and a geometry of 0/45º is the one with the lowest cytotoxicity behavior.  

Beyond the study of the architecture influence, the effect of HA addition to pure PCL scaffolds 

was also evaluated, as well as the influence of different types and percentages of HA used for 

the production of PCL-HA composite scaffolds. The mixtures (PCL-HA) were prepared by 

melt blending (see Chapter 4), which have the advantage of not requiring the use of organic 

solvents with high toxic potential to the cells. The obtained results for the cytotoxicity studies 

that were done indicate that the composite scaffolds of PCL-HA have a much higher ability to 

promote cellular adhesion and survival of macrophages and proliferation of fibroblasts and of 

their co-culture. Comparing the obtained results with the two different types of HA that were 

studied (HA N and HA S) it has been verified that the composite scaffolds of PCL-HA N 

promote a higher cell adhesion and proliferation, which means that these composite scaffolds 

are less toxic to cells. This probably occurs due to the higher biodegradation rate of HA N, 

comparatively with the same one of the HA S, which results from the presence of carbonate 

groups and ions (e.g. magnesium ions) in HA N.  



Chapter 6 – Conclusions and future work 
 

95 

These results lead to the conclusion that the addition of HA increases the bioactivity of 

scaffolds, independently of the percentage and of the type of HA that was used. It was also 

possible to conclude that pore size is the factor that most influences the cytotoxicity properties 

and consequently, cell adhesion and proliferation on scaffolds.   

 
6.1.2  Conclusions of the study with endodontic materials 

The second goal of this work, was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of three endodontic cements, 

respectively AH Plus JetTM, GuttaFlow®2 and the “improved” GuttaFlow®, with different 

compositions on the presence of cells of the connective tissue (fibroblasts), the immune system 

(macrophages) and their co-culture. Based on the obtained MTT results it is possible to 

conclude that the “improved” GuttaFlow® is the material presenting the lowest cytotoxicity, 

which is expressed by the higher number of cells that adhere and proliferate in contact with 

this material. The studies with these endodontic sealers also allow verifying that the 

cytotoxicity of these materials increases with time, namely for higher volumes of material. 

This occurs since for longer times, as referred in Chapter 5, increasing the surface of contact 

between the root canal sealer/endodontic cement and the medium, increases the amount of 

leaching molecules within the medium and consequently increases the cytotoxicity of the 

endodontic material.    

The interpretation of these results is not easy, due the high variation of the effects of each one 

of the studied materials and each of the used volumes in all the studied parameters. None of 

the endodontic materials is totally biocompatible, since all of them have some level of 

cytotoxicity, which is expect attending all the requirements of these materials, namely the 

bactericidal effect.  

In the in vivo studies that were performed it was possible to observe an external reaction of the 

skin to the presence of GuttaFlow® 2. The histological studies allow to conclude that the 

highest inflammatory reaction occurs in the presence of AH Plus JetTM, and the less 

inflammatory reaction occurs in the presence of the “improved” GuttaFlow®.

96 

6.2  Future work 

Upon the obtained results, tests with dental pulp stem cells, which are multipotent stem cells 

that have the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts, will be 

done. For that, an electromagnetic technique using microbeads and specific antibody markers, 

will be used [12-13].  

Studies of tri-culture of fibroblasts, macrophages and osteoblasts could also be done, for both 

studies with scaffolds and endodontic cements. 

The scaffolds observation using SEM technology could also be done in order to clarify if cells 

migrate to the interior of the scaffolds or if they mainly adhere to the surface.  

Results obtained using the scaffolds sterilized with ethylene oxide will be compared with the 

results obtained with the scaffolds sterilized by gamma radiation.  

Based upon the obtained results with fibroblasts, macrophages and their co-culture, and also 

with osteoblasts and their tri-culture with macrophages and fibroblasts, in vivo studies should 

also be done with scaffolds in order to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility of these materials.  

In vivo studies with the endodontic materials should also be done again, but this time they 

should be implanted in the bone tissue instead of subcutaneously.
