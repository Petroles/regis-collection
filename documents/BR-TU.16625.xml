ABSTRACT: Hillslope curvatures are associated with specific environments that correlate to chemical
and mineralogical attributes of soil, so determining specific management zones. Phosphorus is one of
the main limiting factors to the development and longevity of sugarcane. The type and the mineralogical
constitution of the clay fraction play an important role in the phosphorus (P) adsorption of soil. High
proportion of gibbsite (Gb) in soil may be the major responsible for P adsorption. The relationships
among spatial variability as a function of hillslope curvature, the proportion of kaolinite (Kt) and Gb,
and phosphorus adsorption were evaluated in an Alfisol cultivated with sugarcane. Two plots of 1 ha
of a concave and a convex hillslope area were selected and 121 samples were collected in each area.
The maximum P adsorption was determined in six samples taken randomly in each area. Data were
submitted to descriptive statistical and geostatistical analysis. The lowest average values of available
phosphorus were found in the convex area. In this area, the proportion of gibbsite, expressed by the
values of the ratio [Gb/(Gb + Ct)] and the values of maximum adsorption capacity of phosphorus were
higher than in the concave area.

CURVATURAS DE RELEVO, MINERALOGIA DA
ARGILA E ADSORÇÃO DE FÓSFORO EM ARGISSOLO

CULTIVADO COM CANA-DE-AÇÚCAR

RESUMO: As curvaturas do relevo promovem pedoambientes específicos que condicionam os atributos
químicos e mineralógicos do solo e podem auxiliar na definição de zonas específicas de manejo. O
fósforo (P) é um dos principais elementos limitantes ao desenvolvimento e longevidade do canavial.
O teor e a constituição mineralógica da fração argila assumem papel importante na disponibilidade do
P, sendo que a gibbsita (Gb), quando presente em altas proporções no solo, pode ser a principal
responsável pela sua adsorção e indisponibilidade. Investigaram-se as relações e a variabilidade
espacial da adsorção de P e a ocorrência de caulinita (Ct) e gibbsita na fração argila de um Argissolo
Vermelho-Amarelo eutrófico originado de rochas areníticas sob diferentes curvaturas do relevo em
área sob cultivo de cana-de-açúcar. Duas malhas de 1 ha foram delimitadas numa área côncava e outra
área convexa. Foram coletadas 121 amostras em cada área para realização das análises granulométricas,
químicas e mineralógicas. A capacidade máxima de adsorção de P foi obtida em seis amostras escolhidas
ao acaso em cada área. Os resultados foram submetidos às análises estatísticas descritiva e
geoestatística. Os menores valores médios de P disponível encontraram-se na área convexa. Nesta
área, a proporção de gibbsita, expressa pelos valores da razão [Gb/(Gb+Ct)] e os valores de capacidade
máxima de adsorção de fósforo foram maiores do que na área côncava.

INTRODUCTION

The hillslope curvatures and steepness make up a

complex pattern of water and solute transportation in
a soil landscape (Marques Júnior &amp;amp; Lepsch, 2000;
Franzen et. al., 2006). They are also correlated to spe-

cific processes that define the quality, the crystalliza-
tion, the spatial distribution and the type of the soil clay
minerals (Kravchenko &amp;amp; Bullock, 2000; Ghidin et al.,
2006). Camargo et al. (2008) verified the influence of
small differences of the relief in the crystallinity and
distribution of soil clay minerals. Reatto et al. (2008)
studied an Oxisols’ toposequence in the central high-
lands of Brazil both, under local and regional scale, and
observed higher values for the gibbsite / (kaolinite +
gibbsite) in hilly areas in comparison to flatter areas
at the local scale of the study.

Similarities between the spatial distribution of the
soil clay minerals and their chemical properties may
explain the cause/effect relationship between these
properties and the relief curvature (Franzen et al.,
2006). This relationship is important because it can
guide farm management decisions, such as the num-
ber of soil samples necessary to characterize an area
(Souza et al., 2006) and the required amount of fertil-
izer.

Reduced P availability in soil is the most common
nutritional limitation in agricultural production (Motta
et al., 2002; Johnson &amp;amp; Loeppert, 2006), especially in
highly weathered soils. Improving the efficiency of
phosphate fertilization has been objective of many re-
searchers (Francisco et al., 2007; Nogueira &amp;amp; Cardoso,
2007; Galvani et al., 2008). Most crops in Brazil re-
spond positively to the application of phosphorus. How-
ever, most of the supplementary phosphorus becomes
unavailable due to adsorption reactions onto mineral
colloids, precipitation reactions, or conversion to or-
ganic forms (Busato et al., 2005).

The mineralogical composition and content of the
clay fraction assumes an important role in the behav-
ior of phosphorus. Al and Fe hydroxides and oxides
in the clay fraction of soils are considered primarily
responsible for the adsorption of phosphorus (Johnson
&amp;amp; Loeppert, 2006; Ulén &amp;amp; Snäll, 2007), and goethite
is the most effective form (Motta et al., 2002). Con-
versely, Motta et al. (2002) and Mesquita Filho &amp;amp; Tor-
rent (1993) pointed out that its contribution to the ad-
sorption of phosphorus can be the equal to or higher
than that of goethite when in soils with a high amount
of gibbsite. Schaefer et al. (2004) observed that the
maximum capacity of P adsorption is correlated better
with the gibbsite content than with goethite, demonstrat-
ing the importance of Al hydroxides in this phenomenon.

The objectives of the present study were to evalu-
ate: (i) the relationships between phosphorus adsorp-
tion and the occurrence of kaolinite and gibbsite in the
soil clay fraction from samples of an Alfisol cultivated
with sugarcane; and (ii) the spatial variability of sev-
eral soil attributes as a function of differences in
hillslope curvatures.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Soil samples were collected in Catanduva, state of
São Paulo, Brazil. It lies in the Paulista Western Pla-
teau (21°05’S; 49°01’W) geomorphic province. The
climate of the region is classified as Aw (Köppen’s
classification); dry in the winter, with average rainfall
of 1,350 mm, and an average annual temperature of
23°C. The primary vegetation of the Catanduva region
is savannah seasonal pluvial forest, cultivated with sug-
arcane for over 20 years. The soil parent material was
identified as a sandstone from the Bauru Group,
Adamantina formation (IPT, 1981), and the soil is a
Typic Hapludalf (Soil Survey Staff, 1999).

Hillslope curvature were classified according to
Troeh (1965). Two areas were delimited: one con-
cave and another convex (Figure 1). The agricultural
practices of the two areas along the years were iden-
tical; both have been cultivated with the sugarcane,
cultivar SP80-1842, and the last replanting was in
2003. Fluid fertilization was performed with 700 L
ha–1 of 04–12-10 at replanting and 600 L ha–1 10-00-
10 in the ratoon. All applications were performed at
20-cm depth. Filter cake and vinasse were not added
in these areas.

Two 1-ha plots were delimited: one in the concave
hillslope area and the other in the adjacent convex
hillslope area. A spacing grid of 10  10 m was used
in each of the plots, and the grid nodes were
georeferenced using a geodesic GPS. Soil samples were
collected at the grid nodes at 0.0-0.2 m and 0.2-0.4
m, totaling 121 sites per plot (Figure 1).

The potential acidity (H+Al) and organic matter con-
tent (OM) were determined according to Raij et al.
(2001). Exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and available P were
extracted with an ionic exchange resin  (Raij et al.,
2001). Clay cation exchange capacity (CEC) was cal-
culated by dividing the soil CEC by the amount of clay
(Embrapa, 2006). Particle size analysis was performed
by the pipette method (Embrapa, 1997).

The kaolinite-gibbsite system was evaluated in 121
samples of the iron-free clay fraction (Mehra &amp;amp; Jack-
son, 1960) at 0.0-0.2 depth by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
- powder method (Camargo et al., 1986) using a
diffractometer HZG – 4/B, with a Cu cathode with Ni
filter, ka radiation (20 mA, 30 kV), and scanning speed
of 1º2 /min. The gibbsite/(gibbsite+kaolinite) [Gb/
(Gb+Kt)] ratio was calculated by using the reflection
areas of kaolinite [Kt (001)] and gibbsite [Gb (002)].
The mean crystallite dimension (MCD) of Kt and Gb
was calculated from the widths at half height (WHH)
and the position of the reflections of the minerals Kt
(001) and Gb (002) by using Scherrer’s equation
(Schulze, 1984).

Six nodes were chosen from each grid for obtain-
ing the P maximum adsorption data according to the
method described by Casagrande &amp;amp; Camargo (1997).
Concentrations of phosphorus (100, 200, 400, 800,
and 1,600 mg L–1) were added to soils samples, be-
yond the control treatment, without the addition of
phosphorus. The amount of adsorbed P by the soil was
calculated by subtracting the value determined in so-
lution from the total amount added. Linearization was
performed using Langmuir’s equation to obtain the P
maximum sorption capacity.

Chemical and mineralogical soil data were submit-
ted to descriptive statistical analysis using the statisti-
cal software, SAS (Schlotzhaver &amp;amp; Littell, 1997).
Means of the variables were compared by the Student
t test. Next, semivariograms were plotted using
geostatistical analysis.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The available contents of phosphorus were differ-
ent in the two areas (Table 1). The mean values of
the concave and convex areas were 12 and 7 mg dm–
3 at 0-0.2 m, and 11 and 6 mg dm–3 at 0.2-0.4-m depth,
respectively. These differences are relevant and may
influence the decisions regarding soil use and manage-
ment in both areas. The highest clay content was found
in the convex area (Table 1), which may be a con-
tributing factor to reduce P availability. Rolim Netto et

al. (2004) found that the most significant correlations
for the maximum P sorption capacity were associated
with the presence of gibbsite and the clay content.

The largest soil CEC values were observed in the
convex area, which had the least amount of available
P (Table 1). On the other hand, the CEC of the clay
fractions of both areas were similar, which suggests
that the two areas had the same type of clay, although
more clay was found in the convex area. So, the larger
CEC values for the convex area are a result of its higher
contents of clay and organic matter.

The presence of OM favors P desorption to the
soil solution, competing with P for sorption sites
(Mesquita Filho &amp;amp; Torrent, 1993; Heredia &amp;amp; Cirelli,
2007). Mesquita Filho &amp;amp; Torrent (1993) pointed out
that P adsorption can be predicted based on the min-
eralogical characteristics of the soil when the OM
content is low. Comparing the mean areas of the
diffractogram peaks of Kt and Gb (Table 2), differ-
ences were only found for gibbsite. These results
demonstrate that the convex area soil has more
gibbsite and that both areas have very similar amounts
of kaolinite (Table 2). The WHH of kaolinite varied
from 0.33 to 0.83 °2  in the concave area, and 0.38
to 0.87 °2  in the convex area. Ghidin et al. (2006)
studied a toposequence of Oxisols and found WHH
values for kaolinite ranging from 0.55 to 0.85 °2 .
The WHH values for gibbsite ranged from 0.07 to
0.45 °2  in the concave area, and from 0.09 to 0.33

°2  in the convex area. Ghidin et al. (2006) found
WHH values ranging from 0.28 to 0.39 °2  for
gibbsite.

The MCD values of kaolinite for both areas were
different, in the same way to the WHH values. On the
other hand, those values for gibbsite were not differ-
ent. This demonstrates that kaolinite is better crystal-
lized in the concave area, that is, the crystals have a
smaller specific surface area and smaller P sorption ca-
pacity than the crystals in the convex area soil. (Leal &amp;amp;
Velloso, 1973; Juo &amp;amp; Fox, 1977; Fontes &amp;amp; Weed, 1996)

The mean Gb/(Gb+Kt) ratio of the concave area
was 0.06, while that of the convex area was 0.12, and
this difference was significant (Student t test). The
crystallographic attributes (Table 2) are different for
gibbsite, while they are qualitatively different in the two
studied areas for kaolinite. Therefore, the convex area
has a highest proportion of gibbsite and smaller ka-
olinite crystals when compared to the concave area.
The convex area favors the formation of gibbsite, dem-
onstrating that the relief may indicate the boundaries

between the environments and specific areas for the
management and transfer of information (Marques
Júnior &amp;amp; Lepsch, 2000; Franzen et al., 2006).

The mean and median values of all of the proper-
ties were similar, with symmetrical distributions, as
confirmed by the asymmetry values close to zero
(Tables 1 and 2). The normality of the data predicts
stationarity and shows that the so-called proportional
effect was not observed; therefore, the data were
suited for geostatistics (Isaaks &amp;amp; Srivastava, 1989).
According to the classification proposed by Warrick
&amp;amp; Nielsen (1980), low variation coefficients were
found for the Gb/(Gb+Kt) ratio in the convex and con-
cave areas. The same was observed for the CEC of
the convex area at both depth ranges (Tables 1 and
2). The remaining properties presented mean and high
coefficients of variation.

All variables presented spatial dependence at the
two depth ranges (Table 3). At 0.0-0.2 m, only the
convex soil CEC and the clay CEC of the concave
area fitted the exponential model. At 0.2-0.4 m, the

Table 2 - Soil clay mineralogical attributes related to kaolinite (Kt) and gibbsite (Gb) on the concave and the convex hillslope
curvatures at 0.2-0.4-m depth.

OM content of both areas and the CEC of the con-
vex area fitted the Gaussian model. The CEC values
of the soil and clay, the peak area of kaolinite, the MCD
of gibbsite, and the Gb/(Gb+Kt) ratio of the concave
area fitted the exponential model better. The remain-
ing properties fitted the spherical model. Several au-
thors obtained spherical model fitting for most of the
soil properties (Grego &amp;amp; Vieira, 2005).

The degree of spatial dependence of the variables
that were studied (Table 3) was evaluated by using the
classification of Cambardella et al. (1994). At 0.0-0.2-
m depth in the concave area, the P properties and the
soil CEC presented moderate dependence. In the con-
cave area, at 0.2-0.4 m, the P, OM, clay properties
and the CEC of the soil and the kaolinite peak area of
the convex area presented moderate spatial depen-
dence. The remaining properties presented strong spa-
tial dependence.

Ranges were found to vary with depth from 22 to
101 m at 0.0-0.2 m, and 18 to 89 at 0.2-0.4 m in the
concave area. In the convex area, ranges varied from
20 to 26 m at 0.0-0.2 m and from 15 to 30 m at 0.2-
0.4 m (Table 3). The properties presented different
spatial dependence ranges, and ranges for the concave
area were larger for all properties.

The lowest range values and highest spatial variabil-
ity of chemical properties were found in the convex area
(Table 3), demonstrating the influence of relief on the
spatial behavior of these properties (Kravchenko &amp;amp; Bul-

lock, 2000; Souza et al., 2006; Camargo et al., 2008).
Mcbratney &amp;amp; Webster (1983) reported that the efficacy
of the soil sampling strategy can be improved by using
the spatial variability model, which can define specific
management zones when associated to the relief forms
(Marques Júnior &amp;amp; Lepsch, 2000).

The maximum sorption capacity of phosphorus in
the soil from the concave area varied from 416 to 526
mg kg–1, while the soil from the convex area ranged
from 454 to 588 mg kg–1, with mean values of 461
and 539 mg kg–1, respectively (Table 4). This confirms
that gibbsite extensively affect P adsorption and is
more effective than OM (Mesquita Filho &amp;amp; Torrent,
1993). Motta et al. (2002) found that the maximum
capacity of sorption of phosphorus varied from 676
to 1,233 mg kg–1 when the Gb/(Gb+Kt) ratio varied
from 0.47 to 0.54, respectively.

Based in the maximum sorption capacity of phos-
phorus (Table 4) and the amount of available phospho-
rus (Table 1), one can suggest that gibbsite is prima-
rily responsible for higher P adsorption and lower P
availability in the convex than in the concave area be-
cause it has greater proportion and better crystalliza-
tion in this area (Table 2).

CONCLUSIONS

Convex hillslope curvatures were more favorable
environments for the formation of gibbsite than con-



Barbieri et al.824

cave areas. Thus, hillslope curvatures can be used to
define the boundaries of the more homogenous areas.

Gibbsite is a determining factor in the maximum
sorption capacity of phosphorus and in its smaller
availability in the soil of the convex area.

The soil in the hillside area presented greater spa-
tial variability for all of the properties studied as com-
pared to the concave area, indicating that the sam-
pling strategy used in the two areas must be differ-
ent.
