Abstract. The multidisciplinary Coastal Zone (CZ) network from the National Institute of Sciences and 
Technology (INCT) for Climate Change, aims to evaluate the state of knowledge and coordinate projects 
dealing with the effects of global climate changes in the country’s coastal zone. During its first year, CZ 
focused on literature review, historic data analysis and vulnerability studies. The studies were presented 
during the I Brazilian Workshop on Climate Change and Coastal Zones, and resulted in the fifteen 
scientific articles that comprise this Special Issue. Based on regional case studies and a few broad national 
assessments, results showed how the large Brazilian coast and their ecosystems are highly vulnerable to 
climate variability, and which parameters and regions may be more impacted by global climate change. 
With only a few studies aiming to evaluate the vulnerability of biological, ecological and socio-economic 
parameters, along with the many deficiencies on basic knowledge, the country’s coastal and marine zones 
are still neglected by climate change policies. Although a series of scientific goals still need to be 
achieved to better evaluate the effects of climate change on the Brazilian coastal zone, the present volume 
constitute a first step towards the provision of guidance to managers and policymakers. 

 
Key-words: Global Climate Change, impacts and vulnerability, oceanography, coastal geology, marine 
ecology. 

 
Resumo. Introdução ao Volume Especial sobre “Mudança Climática e Zona Costeira Brasileira”. A 
rede Zona Costeira do INCT para Mudanças Climáticas, de caráter multidisciplinar e interinstitucional, 
objetiva de avaliar o estado do conhecimento e coordenar projetos que investiguem os efeitos das 
mudanças climáticas em zonas costeiras brasileiras. Em seu primeiro ano, os projetos focaram em 
revisões da literatura, análises de banco de dados e sobre vulnerabilidades dos ecossistemas. Os 
resultados foram apresentados durante o I Workshop Brasileiro de Mudanças Climáticas em Zonas 
Costeiras, resultando também nos 15 artigos deste Volume Especial. Tendo como base estudos de caso 
regionalizados e algumas avaliações nacionais, os resultados mostram como a extensa costa Brasileira e 
seus ecossistemas são altamente vulneráveis a variabilidade climática, e quais parâmetros e regiões 
poderão ser mais impactados pelas mudanças climáticas globais. Com poucos estudos específicos que 
avaliem a vulnerabilidade de parâmetros biológicos, ecológicos e socio-econômicos, associado às 
inúmeras deficiências de conhecimento básico, as zonas costeira e marinha brasileiras são ainda 
negligencias pelas políticas de mudanças climáticas. Ainda que uma série de metas científicas necessite 
ser alcançadas para melhor avaliar os efeitos das mudanças climáticas em zonas costeiras brasileiras, os 
artigos apresentados neste volume constituem passos preliminares para guiar a gestão e a elaboração de 
políticas públicas sobre o tema. 
 
Palavras-chave: Mudança Climática Global, impactos, vulnerabilidade, geologia costeira, ecologia

Introduction 
Global Climate Change (GCC) has been at 

the centre of scientific debate during the 21st century 
and has received substantial attention from society, 
governments and the private sector worldwide. 
Despite active debate and recognized climate 
uncertainties, the scientific evidences for global 
warming remains robust and the conclusion that 
human activities are affecting the climate cannot be 
undermined (e.g. Schiermeier 2010). Indeed, 
evidences from hundreds of studies are suggesting 
that the pace and scale of changes and its impacts 
are surpassing the predictions outlined by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth 
Assessment Report (IPCC 2007) (McMullen &amp;amp; 
Jabbour 2009, Hoegh-Guldberg &amp;amp; Bruno 2010, 
Nicholls et al. 2010, Stroeve et al. 2011). Global 
Climate Change (GCC) is recognized now as a 
planetary crisis, which impacts represent an 
unprecedented risk for natural ecosystems and 
human civilization. 

Because coastal areas are directly affected 
by sea-level rise, increases in air and sea 
temperature, exposure to extreme events and ocean 
acidification, these areas will be impacted most 
severely by the predicted GCC (Trenberth et al. 
2007). However, despite the significance of the 
climate-related risks affecting the low-lying habitats, 
the paucity of scientific publications dealing with 
specific and regional problems is remarkable 
(Nicholls 2007) and coastal and marine systems are 
vastly underrepresented in comparison with 
terrestrial systems (Richardson &amp;amp; Poloczanska 2008, 
Hoegh-Guldberg &amp;amp; Bruno 2010). Studies and 
predictions relating to the impacts of climate change 
on coastal and marine ecosystems are limited by the 
lack of long-term data, by the lower observational 
capacity and by a lack of integrated approaches to 
link diverse aspects of science and society. The lack 
of information at the regional and local scales 
produces uncertainties about climate, and these 
uncertainties hamper efforts to plan for the future 
(Malone et al. 2010). Furthermore, no coastal and 
marine region on earth is exempt from 
anthropogenic modifications and impacts that affect 
the ecosystem equilibrium and capacity to buffer 
climate change (Halpern et al. 2008).  

Brazil is a globally important country in the 
context of climate change. Owing largely to its 
historical deforestation rate, the country is the 
world’s fourth-largest greenhouse-gas emitter 
(Nepstad et al. 2011). Moreover, Brazil depends 
strongly on its very abundant natural resources. 
Because of that, the country has therefore great 
potential to contribute to the reduction of GCC risks. 

Most of the discussion about Brazil’s contribution to 
mitigate global climate (Santili et al. 2005), as well 
as studies about impacts and vulnerability of natural 
ecosystems to climate change, has been focussed on 
terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Salazar et al. 2007, 
Lapola et al. 2009). However, the country’s large 
coastal and marine zones as well as the country’s 
role in buffering climate change impacts and 
mitigating emissions are still neglected by many 
national and international climate change forums 
and policies (Copertino 2011). The Brazilian coast, 
as many other coasts, is highly vulnerable to present-
day climate variability and may be profoundly 
impacted by the projected climate change (Muehe 
2006, Neves &amp;amp; Muehe 2008). These impacts would 
pose serious threats to coastal biodiversity, 
ecological functions and services to society, 
including the coastal zone’s carbon sequestration 
capacity. However, studies on Brazilian coastal 
vulnerability to GCC were few and isolated, owing 
in part to the fact that the country’s coastal zone is 
very extensive. 

In an attempt to fill this gap in current 
information, a Coastal Zone (CZ) project was 
established within the framework and aims of the 
National Institute of Sciences and Technology 
(INCT) for Climate Change and the Brazilian 
Network for Global Climate Change (Rede 
CLIMA). The full historic context of these large 
research programs and their first results are found in 
their activity report (INCT for Climate Change, 
2010). A brief overview is given by Garcia &amp;amp; Nobre 
in the foreword of this volume. Formed by nearly 50 
scientists, the multidisciplinary and interinstitucional 
CZ network aims to evaluate the current state of 
knowledge, identify deficiencies, establish protocols, 
integrate/coordinated projects and design scientific 
questions in several GCC-related research topics. 
The goals of the project are to investigate the 
impacts of climate change on the Brazilian coast and 
to determine the coast’s vulnerability to these 
changes. The CZ project also seeks to propose 
mitigation and adaptation measures to compensate 
for and to buffer the impacts of climate change. 

To achieve these goals, the CZ project 
organised the “First Brazilian Workshop on Climate 
Change and Coastal Zones”, which was hosted by 
the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) 
(Figure 1). The workshop brought together experts 
from fourteen national institutions and took 
important steps that facilitated the attainment of the 
first project goals. In this three-day workshop, 
experts evaluated the status of the current knowledge 
of Brazilian coastal systems and processes and

presented their preliminary results. In addition, 
participants offered recommendations for future 
studies. The information gathered in the workshop 
resulted in fifteen scientific articles that comprise 
this Special Issue of the Pan-American Journal of 
Aquatic Sciences. In this editorial paper, we provide 
an overview and we also highlight the main findings 
of these articles, placing their importance and 
relevance in the perspective of Brazilian coastal 
zones facing climate change. 

 
Overview of the volume content 

The Brazilian coastline is almost 9,000 km 
long and includes a variety of coastal features such 
as sedimentary cliffs, large and deeply incised 
estuaries, crystalline headlands and low-lying 
coastal plains. By conducting a broad introductory 
review on the morphology and vulnerability of the 
Brazilian coastal zone, Muehe explores how each 
coastal region will respond in different ways to the 
expected climate changes and associated sea-level 
rise. The author concludes that erosion, although 
irregularly distributed, is affecting the entire 
shoreline. The risk of erosion can be magnified by 
sea-level rise and by the increase in the frequency 
and intensity of storms. The southern Brazilian 
coastline, for example, is exposed very often to 
extreme events, i.e., storm surges and storm waves, 
mostly associated with extra-tropical cyclones. The 
frequency and intensity of these extreme events and 
their effects on erosion over the past 30 years is 
analysed by Machado et al., who report a total of 40 
extreme events associated with maximum erosion 
and surge elevation in Rio Grande do Sul State. If 
the predicted sea-level rise occurs, the rise will 
certainly increase the importance of the already-
existing storm surge hazards by intensifying 
inundation and the resulting erosion. In another 
contribution, Muehe et al. show that erosive trends 
are not evident for some coastal-plain areas in Rio 
de Janeiro State. However, the lack of sediment 
sources can make the system highly vulnerable to 
sea-level rise. The sandy dune system is highly 
vulnerable to changes in water balance. These 
changes can affect the sparse foredune vegetation 
cover and have drastic consequences for sediment 
transport and coastal morphology. The study has 
profound implications for predicting the effects of 
temperature increases and rainfall on the fragile 
morpho-sedimentary balance in these coastal plains.  

The vulnerability of the Brazilian coastal 
zone to climate change and the hazards and risks 
involved are evaluate by Nicolodi &amp;amp; Petermann, 
who take into account the natural, social and 
technological characteristics of each coastal 

geographic region. Based on broad-scale and 
detailed information for each region, the authors 
indicate the main economic sectors likely to be 
affected and identify different levels of vulnerability. 
The areas identified as high and very high 
vulnerable should be at the top of the priority list for 
climate change policies and plans. One of the most 
vulnerable areas affected by sea-level rise is the 
Recife (Pernambuco State) metropolitan centre. This 
intensely populated area is highly exposed to coastal 
erosion and inundation and is the site of several land 
use conflicts. Based on optimistic and pessimistic 
IPCC emission scenarios, Costa et al. conduct a 
vulnerability and impact assessment for the region. 
They define coastal and estuarine flooding zones and 
discuss the natural, historical-cultural and economic 
resources at risk. Both studies provide guidance for 
preventive strategies to adapt to the effects of 
climate change.  

The overall consensus seems to be that 
different Brazilian coastal regions will certainly be 
affected and will respond in different ways to 
climate changes. However, further predictions, 
particularly concerning sea-level rise, are very 
limited. Lemos &amp;amp; Ghisolfi show that most of the 
tide-gauge measurements performed along the coast 
are not accurate. This widespread inaccuracy thus 
places a serious limitation on attempts to clearly 
define the effects of global warming on the mean sea 
level along the Brazilian coast. These authors 
investigate the causes for this lack of accuracy and 
report that methodological, technological and 
institutional problems need to be addressed to 
provide better estimates of the sea level. 

Brazil is home to the third-largest mangrove 
area in the world (Giri et al. 2011). Brazilian 
artisanal fishers are highly dependent on these 
mangrove systems, which occupy 80% of the 
coastline and have been threatened by several 
anthropogenic impacts. Faraco et al. propose an 
innovative methodology to assess the vulnerability 
of mangrove system to climate change, adapted to 
Brazilian reality. The proposal includes not only sea-
level rise estimates but also resilience and adaptation 
capacity of the communities and the impacts of 
Brazilian conservation policies. The integrated 
socio-ecological diagnosis and approach may lead to 
a challenge in the development of management 
practices and more flexible policies, which are made 
with the stakeholder´s participation, including 
mitigation and adaptation strategies. 

Also important for conservation, fishing and 
tourism, Brazilian coral reefs are exposed to several 
kinds of natural and anthropogenic impacts. Corals 
have been degraded worldwide by eutrophication,

pollution and overfishing (Hughes et al. 2007). They 
are also seriously threaten by climate changes 
impacts such as ocean acidification and warming 
that are leading to decreased growth rates and 
increasing bleaching and diseases (Anthony et al. 
2008, De´ath et al. 2009, Wild 2011). The status of 
the coral reefs of Brazil is reviewed by Leão et al., 
who identify the reefs that are more stressed by 
anthropogenic impacts and more vulnerable to 
climate change effects. The review provides an 
important basis for establishing priorities for future 
research and conservation plans for these unique 
Brazilian marine systems, which are marked by a 
resistant relict coral fauna and a high level of 
endemism. 

The study of modes of large-scale climate 
variability in relation to regional climate and 
oceanographic parameters can reveal trends that are 
fundamental to GCC studies. Focusing on the 
responses of large marine ecosystems (LMEs), 
Gherardi et al. explore spatial patterns of correlation 
between several climate indices (Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation, ENSO, North and South Atlantic and 
Antarctic Oscillation Index) and sea surface 
temperature anomalies (SSTA) for the Southwest 
Atlantic. Their findings reveal distinct correlation 
patterns for the Brazilian LMEs. The authors point 
out that the response of LMEs to climatic variability 
may not be controlled by the ecological criteria used 
to define the LMEs. The characteristics of the 
dependence on the SSTA of productivity and trophic 
relations in each of the Brazilian LMEs are such that 
mixed responses are likely to be produced at the 
ecosystem level. Therefore, despite the great 
importance of this framework for marine resource 
assessment and management, the use of LME 
responses for monitoring GCC impacts requires 
great caution. 

Changes in global primary production have 
been showed by several studies over the past 
decades, in association with multi-decadal climate 
and ocean variability (Chavez et al. 2011). Climate 
driven changes in ocean temperature, nutrients and 
light lead to changes in phytoplankton biomass and 
structure, but the relative importance of the impacts 
and the biological responses are regionally varying 
(Marinov et al. 2010). The lack of long-term 
biological observations makes it difficult to detect 
robust changes with time at regional scales. Ciotti et 
al. used satellite data to conduct a first comparative 
evaluation of surface chlorophyll over the entire 
Brazilian continental shelf (BCS), characterising 
each region. The authors conclude that the detection 
of long-term trends is currently still not feasible for 
the BCS. Despite the paucity of in situ 

measurements and the optical complexity associated 
with Brazilian coastal waters, remote sensing of 
ocean color is undoubtedly the best available tool for 
a global description of chlorophyll and to predict the 
effects of GCC on marine primary production. The 
use of these techniques in Brazilian science should 
be enhanced. 

Rainfall distribution and hydrological 
balance are likely to be affected by GCC (Meehl et 
al. 2007). Lake and lagoon levels are among the 
most apparent signals of change in water quantity. 
The water catchment surface area is much greater 
than the lake itself, and the water level can therefore 
visibly reflect the influence of climate on a relatively 
large area (Williamson et al. 2009). By analysing 90 
years of water-level records for Mirim Lagoon 
(Brazil-Uruguay frontier), Hirata et al. find long-
term changes strongly associated with ENSO and 
identified two regime shifts, apparently related to the 
cold and warm phases of the Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation during the previous century. The last 
warm phase, between 1977 and 1998, significantly 
affected the water balance of a wide region in 
Southern South America (Haylook et al. 2006, 
Agosta and Compagnucci 2008). Hirata and co-
authors work provides key insights for predicting the 
possible effects of trends in regime shifts and of 
climate change on the water balance of the coastal 
lagoons and wetlands of southern Brazil. 

Fisheries may be impacted by climate 
changes in several ways. They may be affected by 
the increasing temperature, changes in salinity and 
ocean currents, and also through the changes in 
nursery habitats and ecosystem primary production. 
Combining IPCC emission scenarios with regional 
climate models, climate and biological time series 
data, and accounting for local anthropogenic 
alterations, Shroeder &amp;amp; Castello evaluate the future 
impacts of global warming on the fisheries of Patos 
Lagoon. They predict that the main factor affecting 
fisheries in this region will be the acceleration of the 
outflow current at the mouth of the lagoon. This 
hydrological change will have important cones-
quences for the population dynamics of valuable fish 
resources and may produce changes to the fishing 
calendar. Exploring a series of cause-effect 
relationship, the authors call attention for the fact 
that climate changes impacts on the local fisheries 
can be both negative and positive, depending on the 
factor and on the considered species. 

Global warming is expect to affect the 
distribution of marine communities and many 
evidences of species shifting and changing 
abundance are raising from literature (Hoegh-
Guldberg 2010). Previous biological knowledge and

a comparison of present and past data allow De 
Faveri et al. to find important changes in an 
intertidal macroalgal community in southern Brazil 
(Santa Catarina State). The results include the 
appearance of tropical and opportunist species not 
previously described in this region, and the 
disappearance of local common taxa that used to 
occur in the 70´s decade. Many marine population 
responses to temperature increases are expected to 
be pronounced or to be initially detected in 
transitional warm-temperate regions, such as 
Southern Brazilian region. On rock shores, however, 
climate change may not lead to a simple poleward 
shift in the distribution of intertidal organisms but 
may cause localized extinctions, due to the inability 
of species to move into suitable habitats (Hawkins et 
al. 2008).Therefore, monitoring marine populations, 
with a focus on stenothermic species, can provide 
useful indicators of climate change effects, 
particularly where historical temperature data are not 
available. 

The contributions appearing in the present 
volume deal mainly with climate variability and its 
potential impacts during the previous decades or the 
past century. In contrast, Medeanic &amp;amp; Correa go 
further back through recent geological time. Based 
on radiocarbon and palynomorphic data from cores, 
these authors make a preliminary paleore-
construction of climate, sea-level oscillation and 
environmental changes in the coastal plain of the 
southernmost state of Brazil during the Holocene 
(~10,000 B.P.). Their work highlights the potential 
of palynomorph proxies as a tool to predict future 
scenarios based on climatic change periodicity. 

The crucial role of scientific communication 
and media coverage on the GCC issue is also 
considered in this volume. Hellebrandt &amp;amp; 
Hellebrandt review the coverage of GCC by the 
Brazilian media and identified critical points. 
Among these points is the predominance of issues 
set by an international scientific and political 
agenda. The Brazilian media reproduces information 
provided by international agencies and news sources 
connected with this agenda, which overlooks both 
local reality and scientific expertise. Failure to 
communicate key messages about climate change, 
particularly if the regional context is not considered, 
can have negative implications for public awareness 
and for establishing climate change policies. 

 
Final remarks 

If the physics of climate change still 
involves many uncertainties, the impacts of climate 
change on coastal and marine ecosystems are still 
very much controversial, particularly in the case of 

analysis at the regional level. It seems relatively less 
complicated to predict the effects of a changing 
parameter (e.g., rising temperature, acidification and 
decreasing light) on isolated species from previous 
knowledge about their physiology, ecology and 
reproductive biology. However, many challenges 
arise when predicting the responses at the 
community and ecosystem level, in addition to the 
complexity added by synergistic effects (Walther et 
al. 2002, Williams et al. 2008, Russel et al. 2009, 
Hoegh-Guldberg &amp;amp; Bruno 2010). Therefore, the 
challenge posed to the worldwide scientific 
community working with GCC and its impacts is 
paramount and will demand the best of our talent 
and creativity.  

The papers presented in this Special Issue 
constitute a first step towards the provision of 
guidance to managers and policymakers who must 
address the impacts of GCC in the Brazilian coastal 
zone, particularly in relation to the Climate Change 
National Plan. However, a series of scientific goals 
still need to be achieved to evaluate the effects of 
climate change on the Brazilian coastal zone. These 
goals include the analysis and integration of 
historical data, the application of standardised 
protocols, hypothesis testing, and continuous data 
acquisition programmes specifically designed to 
observe the coastal environments.  

For most Brazilian coastal ecosystems and 
regions, temporal and large spatial data is scarce for 
both biotic and abiotic parameters. Where available, 
information is isolated, punctual in space, with short 
and incomplete time series (if any). Most studies 
also lack integrated or comparative protocol 
consistency. Scientific evaluations and future 
planning on the impacts of climate change along 
Brazilian coastal zone will achieve development if 
observational systems are implemented and 
improved to allow systematic monitoring programs 
of physical, chemical, biological and social 
parameters. Experimental approaches can help 
climate change science and management, but only 
after a better determination of questions and 
hypothesis, that are specific to each regional 
condition. 

By researching GCC, science and scientists 
cannot be apart from society. Public awareness and 
education may affect, at middle and long term, 
society opinion, behaviour and political decisions, 
contributing for the advance of climate change 
policies and actions. The Rio Grande Declaration, 
an open letter released soon after the Workshop and 
now officially published in this volume, constitutes a 
preliminary attempt of CZ members and meeting 
participants to contribute to awareness and influence

public policies. The letter warns about climate 
change problems, particularly the ones affecting the 
coast, and claims for society and political action. 

By indicating deficiencies and revealing 
scientific hurdles, and pointing out the consequences 
for ecosystems and society, the present volume is 
expected to offer new insights and stimulate future 

studies of impacts, mitigation measures and 
adaptation strategies for Brazilian coastal zones 
facing Global Climate Change. It is also envisaged 
that this initial step will foster new knowledge that 
will represent a significant Brazilian contribution to 
international scientific forums addressing this 
important issue.
