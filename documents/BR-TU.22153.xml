ABSTRACT 

GARCIA VILLA, J. S. Optimization and Comparison between Polymer, Surfactant-

Polymer and Water Flooding Recoveries in a Pre-salt Carbonate Reservoir 

Considering Uncertainties. 2019. 156 p. Dissertation (Master’s degree) – Mining and 

Petroleum Engineering Department of the Escola Politécnica of the University of Sao 

Paulo, Sao Paulo, 2019. 

A successful Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (CEOR) program starts with a proper 

process selection for a given field, followed by a formulation of the batch components 

and a representative simulation step. Also, lab studies, field data, pilot testing, and 

economic analyses are required before project implementation. This work discusses 

the state of the art of the Surfactant-Polymer flood (SP) EOR technique, specifically for 

carbonate reservoirs, and states a methodology mixing laboratory, literature and 

reservoir simulation, to assess its applicability under economic and geological 

uncertainties. First, it is explained concepts related to the research, such as polymer, 

surfactant, microemulsion, functionalities of each chemical injected, advantages, and 

disadvantages. Second, a state of the art is developed about recent SP advances. 

Third, it is described the laboratory method being used to evaluate some properties of 

the chemicals injected for the Polymer flooding (PF) and SP flooding. Later, the 

simulation study step being conducted is explained, which will define the volume 

recovered and Net Present Value (NVP) obtained for the PF, SP injections and water 

flooding, in different economic and geological scenarios for two models resembling 

carbonate Brazilian reservoirs. Finally, it is discussed the results obtained, future 

researches that could be performed, and the respective bibliography. As part of this 

research, it was verified the Xanthan gum shows adequate results at different 

concentrations; that a surfactant specifically selected for a carbonate rock with low 

Interfacial tension and low adsorption is required; also that for the Lula based model 

although the polymer flooding and Surfactant-Polymer simulation brought some 

benefits, when compared with the waterflooding, on different economic scenarios and 

geological models, the high cost associated to the chemical handling facilities and 

volume spent do not make favorable its application in any scenario. On the contrary 

for the Cerena I field model, it was found the SP and Polymer flooding on all cases 

brought better results when compared with the water injection. Concluding that the 

performance and success of a CEOR program require finding the correct slug 



 
 

 
 

characteristics for the unique conditions of each reservoir. In this research the reservoir 

with higher production rates made possible the use of Chemical EOR presenting better 

results than a water injection however in the smaller model they were not economically 

viable due to the additional associated prices.  

Key Words:  Enhanced Oil Recovery, Surfactant-Polymer, Polymer, Carbonate

RESUMO 

GARCIA VILLA, J. S. Otimização e comparação entre recuperação por injeção de 

Polímero, Surfactante-Polímero e Água num reservatório carbonático do Pré-sal 

considerando incertezas. 2019. 156p. Dissertação de Mestrado – Departamento de 

Engenharia de Minas e Petróleo da Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo, 

2019. 

Um programa bem-sucedido de recuperação melhorada de petróleo por método 

químico (CEOR) começa com uma seleção precisa do processo para um determinado 

campo, seguido pela formulação dos componentes e uma etapa de formulação 

representativa.  Adicionalmente, testes laboratoriais, dados de campos, testes pilotos 

e análises econômicas são necessárias antes da implementação de um projeto. Este 

trabalho discute o estado da arte da técnica de recuperação melhorada de petróleo 

(EOR) pela injeção de surfactante-polímero (SP), especificamente para reservatórios 

carbonáticos e, utilizada uma metodologia baseada em dados de laboratório, literatura 

e de simulação de reservatório para avaliar sua aplicabilidade sob incertezas 

econômicas e geológicas. Primeiramente, são explicados conceitos necessários a 

este trabalho relacionados com polímero, surfactante, microemulsão, funcionalidades 

de cada produto químico injetado, vantagens e desvantagens. Em segundo lugar, um 

estado da arte é desenvolvido sobre os avanços recentes do SP. Após, descreve-se 

os métodos laboratoriais utilizados para avaliar algumas propriedades dos produtos 

químicos usados nas injeções de Polímeros (PF) e SP.  

Posteriormente, é explicada a etapa do estudo de simulação, que definirá o volume 

recuperado e o valor presente líquido (NVP), obtidos para injeções PF, SP e água, em 

diferentes cenários econômicos e geológicos, para dois modelos semelhantes a 

reservatórios carbonáticos brasileiros. Por fim, são discutidos os resultados obtidos, 

sugestões de trabalhos futuros e apresentação da bibliografia. Como parte desta 

pesquisa, verificou-se que a goma xantana apresenta resultados consistentes em 

diferentes concentrações e que é necessário um surfactante especificamente 

selecionado para uma rocha carbonática, possuindo baixa tensão interfacial e baixa 

adsorção. Para o modelo baseado em Lula, embora a simulação de injeção de 

polímero e surfactante-polímero tenham trazido alguns benefícios, quando 

comparados com a injeção de água, em diferentes cenários econômicos e modelos 



 
 

 
 

geológicos, o alto custo associado às instalações de manipulação química e volume 

gasto não favorece sua aplicação em qualquer cenário. Por outro lado, no modelo de 

campo Cerena I, verificou-se que as injeções de SP e de polímero, em todos os casos, 

trouxeram melhores resultados quando comparadas com a injeção de água. 

Concluindo, o desempenho e o sucesso de um programa de CEOR exige encontrar 

as corretas características de slugs para condições únicas de cada reservatório. Neste 

trabalho, o reservatório com maiores taxas de produção infere que o método químico 

de EOR apresente melhores resultados quando comparado com a injeção de água.

1. INTRODUCTION 

During the primary and secondary oil recovery phase, as a result of an inefficient 

macroscopic sweep and a microscopic capillary entrapment, the residual oil is found 

in the reservoir as a discontinuous volume of droplets which can reach up to 70% of 

the original oil in place (HIRASAKI; MILLER; PUERTO, 2011), leaving in average only 

one third of crude acquirable with conventional techniques. Therefore, one of the 

biggest challenges the oil industry has encountered is to increment the global efficiency 

of oil recovery on mature reservoirs worldwide. Regarding EOR methods, the objective 

is to mobilize the residual oil by increasing the capillary number (Nc), which describes 

the ratio of viscous to capillary forces (CHO et al., 2018). 

Since the higher the Nc, the lower the residual oil saturation (STEGEMEIER, 

1977; AMRAN et al., 2017), the residual saturation on the reservoir strongly depends 

on the relationship found on the capillary number (Nc) equation,  

?? =  
??

?
 (1) 

Where ? is the fluid velocity, ? is the displacing fluid viscosity, and ? is the 

interfacial tension between displaced and displacing fluids. Regarding this equation, 

the increase of oil recovery can be achieved in three different ways: the first one would 

be an increase of displacing fluid viscosity, affecting the macroscopic sweep, but not 

the microscopic sweep. The second one would be a reduction of interfacial tension 

which does impact the microscopic sweep efficiency, possible with interfacial tension 

reducers and the third is by increasing the velocity of the fluid on the porous media 

(FARAJZADEH et al., 2012). 

Between the enhanced and improved recovery methodologies being employed 

to increase the hydrocarbon recovery, it can be found a diverse selection of techniques 

in which chemical EOR methods (CEOR) are well established. The more well-known 

processes are polymer flood, surfactant flood, alkaline flood and any mix from the 

previous ones such as the alkaline-surfactant flood (AS), the alkaline-surfactant-

polymer flood (ASP) and the surfactant-polymer flooding (SP). Processes where 

polymer has as main function to provide mobility control by viscosifying the water; the 



 
 

 
 

surfactant reduces the interfacial tension and alter the rock wettability; and the alkaline 

reacts with the oil acids, generating an in-situ soap, which will provide an additional 

source for rock wettability alteration and a minor need of adding synthetic surfactant in 

the slug (CHANG et al., 2006; AYIRALA; YOUSEF, 2015). 

However, although CEOR methods had an important growth in the 1980s, they 

are highly sensitive to oil prices and the chemical additive costs, if compared with other 

methodologies such as  waterflooding, CO2 injection, steam injection and water 

alternating gas (MANRIQUE; MUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007b). The techniques require 

finding the correct slug characteristics for the unique conditions of each reservoir. 

Variables such as chemical concentration, water ratio, ions presence, flow rate, and 

others influence the production program (OLAJIRE, 2014; SHENG, 2014). Moreover, 

challenges on field scale applications are also encountered: (1) operational difficulties, 

(2) surfactant precipitation, (3) difficulties in treating produced emulsions, (4) produced 

water disposal treatment, and (5) sole challenges of offshore application (OLAJIRE, 

2014; SHENG, 2014). 

There has been little report studying the SP injection on carbonate reservoirs, 

some authors when constructing screening parameters, do not include these type of 

rock formations, or even the SP injection because of the difficulties previously 

mentioned. As an example, Dickson (2010) do not include the SP injection, Taber 

(1997) and Al Adasani (2011) proposed screenings recompiling several parameters 

from other authors, where they recommend sandstones as reservoir rocks. The fact  

there is little report of field scale application on SP flooding, strictly speaking (no alkali 

injection), most of them were done before 1990, none in Latin America and only four 

applications on carbonate reservoirs successfully carried out in the literature between 

1970 to 2018 (FOSTER, 1973; MILLER; RICHMOND, 1978; WKFMNYER, 1982; 

TALASH; STRANGE, 1982; THOMAS et al., 1982; RATERMAN, 1990; HOLLEY; 

CAYLAS, 1992; BOU-MIKAEL et al., 2000; MANRIQUE; MUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007a; 

ZHU et al., 2012; ZHENQUAN et al., 2013; SHENG, 2013a; AL-AMRIE et al., 2015). 

In consideration of these conditions and the previously mentioned challenges, 

the oil industry in offshore basins and carbonate reservoirs requires designs of SP 

programs with the following characteristics: (1) chemicals usable in adversary reservoir 

conditions, (2) designs flexibles for carbonate reservoir rocks, (3) divalent tolerable 



 
 

 
 

chemicals, pre-salt conditions are over 50.000 ppm (BELTRAO et al., 2009), (4) 

surfactants with lower precipitation tendency (with divalent ions), (5) single formulation 

for different field requirements, and, (6) chemicals with less environmental effects 

(OLAJIRE, 2014; AL-SINANI et al., 2016). 

Therefore, defining the applicability of SP flooding as an alternative for a 

Brazilian carbonate formation requires studying a program containing surfactant and 

polymer injection. In this research, a preliminary selection of products available is 

discussed, considering the rock properties and formation fluids. Secondly, it is 

evaluated the laboratory information and literature data which is used on the simulation 

phase based on the requirements of a carbonate reservoir with conditions like an 

offshore pre-salt field. 

The simulation study was carried by using two synthetics 3D reservoir models 

resembling the Jupiter Field and Lula Field. The former was related to the CERENA I, 

a synthetic model benchmark built by the CERENA Institute (MADEIRA, 2014) 

because resembles some of the common characteristics of a Brazilian Pre-Salt 

carbonate (medium oil, high CO2 content, and high pressures) with a microbiolite 

reservoir and a non-reservoir facies. The latter was obtained and adjusted from 

literature data also for the Brazilian pre-salt. An evaluation of two models was selected 

to evaluate how, despite being two Brazilian offshore reservoirs, their characteristics 

differ between each other such as temperature, PVT model, wettability, pressure, and 

CO2 content. 

The inputs information for the simulation study regarding some physical-

chemical parameters from the selected chemicals were obtained from the laboratory 

experimentation for the polymer (xanthan gum) and literature review for the surfactant 

(zwitterionic type). Concerning the surfactant, available laboratory screening tests 

were carried out in some available materials to guide the choice of the literature 

surfactant data for the simulation input. For all cases, a high salinity scenario was 

considered, as conditions over 50000 ppm chloride content are observed in the field 

(BELTRAO et al., 2009). 

After analyzing the results, it is discussed if it is viable or not the injection of SP 

as a possible Chemical-EOR technique for further studies on Brazilian offshore 

conditions.

2. FUNDAMENTALS 

On an SP flood, the polymer has as primary function providing mobility control, 

while the surfactant reduces the interfacial tension between water and oil phases, 

improving the final oil recovery on the reservoir. However, it presents disadvantages 

such as low permeability pore plugging, high costs either by manufacturing or storage 

and treatment facilities, high instability in harsh conditions (such as high salt 

concentration and high temperature) and mechanical degradation of the polymer 

(SRIVASTAVA et al., 2009). Reasons why finding alternatives and improving the 

performance of this injection, has been crucial. Next, it is relevant to introduce some 

key concepts for the SP flooding, the object of this work. 

2.1. SURFACTANT (S)  

An amphiphilic compound, with two functional groups, where the first is 

hydrophilic and the second one is hydrophobic, containing then: a water-insoluble tail 

and a water-soluble head (OLAJIRE, 2014), an example on Figure 2.1-1. 

Figure 2.1-1 Schematic of a surfactant structure. 

 

Source: Author, 2019. 

Surfactants can be classified as anionic, cationic, nonionic, and zwitterionic 

according to the ionic nature of their head group. The anionic surfactants have a 

negative charge and are more widely used for EOR projects on sandstone reservoirs. 

Cationic ones have a positive surface-active portion and low adsorption on carbonate 

reservoirs but are expensive. Nonionic surfactants have no apparent ionic charge, are 



6 
 

 
 

more tolerable to high salinity, but they don’t reduce the IFT as good as the other types, 

therefore are employed as cosurfactants to improve the phase behavior system. 

Zwitterionic have both ionic charges, have strong electrolyte tolerance (therefore salt 

tolerance), are thermodynamically stables, but they are not that extensively studied as 

the other types of surfactants (ROSEN, 2004; SHENG, 2013b). 

The main objective of surfactant use on the batch is to reduce the interfacial 

tension (IFT) between the water and the oil, recovering, in that way, the residual oil 

trapped on the pores of the rocks. When the oil encounters the chemical batch, the 

surfactant accumulates between the fluids contact interface and it forms an adsorbed 

layer, which reduces the IFT. This one allows the dispersed oil droplets to be swept 

and produced. 

Levitt et al., (2009, 2016) mentioned the formulation requirements for a 

surfactant being employed in an EOR method: 

? The surfactant solubilization ratio ? 10 (explained in the microemulsion 

section); 

? Low viscosity microemulsion phase with low apparent macroemulsion; 

? A transparent solution at reservoir temperature (no oil addition conditions); 

? Low adsorption on the rock surface.  

2.2. POLYMER (P) 

A polymer is a long chain molecule formed by the joining of smaller molecules 

called monomers, which results in a high molecular weight (KASIMBAZI, 2014). It is 

employed in EOR methodologies to increase the sweep efficiency of the injected fluid 

by reducing the mobility ratio defined as: 

? =
????

????
 (2) 

Where M, ??, ?? ??, and ?? are mobility ratio, water and oil relative permeability 

at the endpoints and oil and water viscosity, respectively. The polymer, when 

incorporated on the water injection, increases the viscosity of the displacing fluid, 



7 
 

 
 

reaching then closer values to one (1), which is defined as a controlled process (Rosa, 

Carvalho, &amp;amp; Xavier, 2006).  

Sheng, Leonhardt and Azri (2015) describe the sweep efficiency increasing 

because of reducing viscous-fingering, improving the displacing fluid injection profile 

due to crossflow between vertical heterogeneous layers and longest permeability 

reduction after the flooding of the solution containing polymer. In Figure 2.2-1 can be 

observed an example of the areal sweep efficiency of a water injection compared with 

the one obtained with a polymer injection for an inverted five spot model. Figure 2.2-1a 

shows a simplified aerial view of how the water channels in the reservoir resulting in 

lower recovery efficiencies, while Figure 2.2-1b resembles the polymer flooding which 

reduces fingering issues and reaches a larger area than the first by having a more 

homogeneous front.

Two main types of polymers are employed in chemical EOR methodologies 

(CEOR), synthetic polymers such as partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and 

biopolymers such as Xanthan gum and Scleroglucan (SHENG, 2011; 

KULAWARDANA et al., 2012; KASIMBAZI, 2014; MOHAMID et al., 2015). The HPAM 

is the most widely used because of its low costs and larger viscoelasticity than other 

polymers; however, it is susceptible to the brine salinity and hardness (OLAJIRE, 

2014). On the other hand, biopolymers and specifically Xanthan gum are relatively 

insensitive to salinity and hardness, but their main disadvantage is their susceptibility 

to bacterial degradation (KASIMBAZI, 2014). Examples of these polymer structures 

can be observed in Figure 2.2-2 and Figure 2.2-3.

structures.

According to Levitt et al. (2009, 2016) a polymer solution for an EOR method 

must meet the following parameters: 

a. Aggregates low or free polymer solution to ensure there are no particles capable 

of plugging the formation (indicated by a filter ratio test); 

b. Acceptable injectivity in the reservoir; 

c. Stable at reservoir temperature and ionic composition over a reservoir-

residence timescale. 

2.3. MICROEMULSION TYPES 

The Winsor classification (Winsor, 1954) identifies four general types of phase 

equilibrium for the microemulsion. On type I, the surfactant is preferentially water 

soluble, and the microemulsion is oil in water (o/w). In this case, the rich-surfactant 

water phase coexists with the oil phase, where the surfactant appears in the form of 



9 
 

 
 

monomers at low concentration. On type II, the surfactant appears mainly on the oil 

phase and the microemulsion formed is water in oil (w/o), in which, the surfactant-rich 

oil phase coexists with the poorest aqueous phase. On type III, a triphasic system is 

generated where the intermediate phase rich on surfactants, coexist with the water and 

oil phases, both with a low surfactant concentration. Finally, in type IV, one micellar 

solution phase appears, which is formed when there is enough addition of an 

amphiphilic volume. In Figure 2.3-1 can be observed the schematic of how each 

microemulsion (ME) type behaves according to the previously discussed. 

Figure 2.3-1 Schematic examples of microemulsion phase behavior types 

according to Winsor classification. 

 

Source: SHENG, 2011. 

Technically, type III is preferred, because it reaches an ultra-low IFT between 

the microemulsion phase and the water and oil-rich phases (equal or less than 

1?10?3 ??/? for successful solubilization and oil recovery). It sweeps the remaining 

oil as one unified bank with little entrapment of the microemulsion phase, which means 

that there will be a larger area swept by the surfactant and a bigger volume of chemistry 

recovered on the surface facilities. Attention must be taken to the optimal salinity 

ranges where the type III microemulsion can be reached, meaning that it can be 

considered a crucial factor in a surfactant-based flood.  

The solubilization ratio of oil is the ratio of the volume of solubilized oil to the 

volume of surfactant present (Vo/Vs), and the solubilization ratio of the water is 

calculated following the same concept for the water volume (Vw/Vs). The optimal 

salinity can be defined as the point where the solubilization ratios Vo/Vs and Vw/Vs are 

equal (ZHANG et al., 2006). Huh (1979) proposed that for a classical Winsor III 



10 
 

 
 

behavior the solubilization ratios between the microemulsion phase and excess oil and 

brine phases respectively were defined as, 

??? = ? (
??

??
)

2
?   (3)   ??? = ? (

??

??
)

2
?   (4) 

Where c is a constant for each system, ??? and ??? are the interfacial tension between 

phases on a Winsor type III microemulsion. This way, the IFT of the mixture (water, oil 

and surfactant) can be calculated based on experimental data of solubilization ratios. 

2.4. CRITICAL MICELLE CONCENTRATION  

As the concentration of a surfactant increases, molecules start to interact with 

each other and organize aggregates of larger numbers of molecules called micelles. 

In these, the lipophilic parts will associate in the interior of the aggregate, and the 

hydrophilic parts will face the aqueous medium. The concentration at which the 

molecules start to interact, and form micelles is called critical micelle concentration 

(CMC), and over its value, the surface tension will not be reduced any further. It 

depends highly on the surfactant type, while it has a smaller dependence on pressure 

and temperature (SCHRAMM; MARANGONI, 2001; BENT, 2014; LASKARIS, 2015). 

The surfactant effectiveness can be defined as how much the surface 

tension/interfacial tension can be reduced until reaching the CMC in the mixture. 

Therefore, it’s a parameter which characterizes the surfactant and relates the IFT 

behavior, making its evaluation a detail to observe (CRAFT; ABDELRAHIM, 2012). 

2.5. PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION 

An optimization method was used in this research, the Particle Swarm 

Optimization algorithm (PSO), which will be later mentioned in the methodology 

section. The PSO is a global optimization method developed by Kennedy and Eberhart 

(1995) which can be explained by the behavior of bird flocks, where individual adjusts 

its fly vector according to their individual and the companion's experiences. In it, each 

PSO candidate, or particle, represents a D-dimensional space, being D the number of 



11 
 

 
 

parameters to be optimized (KEMMOÉ TCHOMTÉ; GOURGAND, 2009). Hence, the 

position of the particle and the population or swarm of N candidate’s solutions can be 

described as 

?? = [??1, ??2, … , ??? ]     (5) 

? = [?1, ?2, … , ??}     (6) 

While an optimal solution is searched, the particles update their position 

iteratively based on the next relation: 

??,?+1 = ?1??,? + ?2?1(??,? ? ??,? ) + ?3?1(??,? ? ??,? )   (7) 

where, ??,? it’s the velocity vector associated to the particle, t and t+1 are two 

consecutive iterations of the algorithm, ??,? it’s the best solution so far by the particle, 

??,? it’s the global best solution of the swarm, ?1 are random diagonals matrices of 

random numbers from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1 and ?1, ?2, ?3are constants 

modulating the magnitude of the steps taken by a particle in the direction of its personal 

and global best solution.   

2.6. EXPECTED MONETARY VALUE 

According to Fraser and Seba (1993), the expected monetary value (EMV) 

combines quantitative probabilities (estimates) with each alternative element 

evaluated. This parameter is defined as the sum of the product of the probability of 

each outcome times the value of that outcome for all possible outcomes, so for this 

research purposes:  

??? = ? ? ??????? ? ?? ? ??   (8) 

where ???? it’s the optimal Net Present Value for each possible case and ??  its 

the probability that of each the NPV’s will occur. 

The expected monetary value is used in this research to quantify the economic 

performance of the injection programs: waterflooding, polymer flooding, and 

Surfactant-Polymer flooding.

3. STATE OF THE ART 

As described previously in the introduction, the benefits of both components 

on the SP method have a synergistic effect that may help to reach higher recovery 

factors on adequate production fields. However, the Surfactant Polymer flood is a 

CEOR method traditionally employed only in sandstone reservoirs and it has been 

less studied than ASP and Polymer floodings (TABER et al., 1997; MANRIQUE; 

MUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007b; ROMERO-ZERÓN, 2012; ZHU et al., 2012; OLAJIRE, 

2014; SHENG, 2014).   

Manrique et al. (2007) briefly explained that, although CEOR methods had an 

important growth in the 1980s, they are highly sensitive to oil prices and the chemical 

additive costs, if compared with other methodologies such as WAG, waterflooding, 

CO2 flood. Moreover, they possess several issues to overcome, as described next. 

Olajire (2014) resumes five challenges to overcome in order to put an ASP 

project in a field scale application, which can be extrapolated to an SP program: (1) 

operation difficulties, (2) surfactant precipitation, (3) difficulties in treating produced 

emulsions, (4) produced water disposal treatment and (5) sole challenges of offshore 

application. Meanwhile Zhu et al. (2012) describes five: (1) lack of high efficient and 

stable industrial surfactants, (2) lack of understanding on the oil displacement 

mechanism of the technique, (3) imperfect evaluation method, reflected in a non-

existing standard methodology, (4) few pilot tests performed in history and (5) high 

technological risk. These difficulties limit the SP applicability and selection in a 

preliminary screening stage, but also bring forward the future developments that 

must be carried to make it attractive in other non-traditional scenarios.  

There are few reports of field scale application on SP flooding, strictly 

speaking, alkali-free. Chauhan (2014) on his research reported 42 SP/Micellar 

Polymer flooding projects carried out worldwide until 2014, based on the Oil &amp;amp; Gas 

Journal biennially report, however, most of these projects are only mentioned on the 



13 
 

 
 

literature without further description of them. From this total, only 3 of the 33 projects 

on the U.S were performed on carbonate reservoirs, according to Manrique et al. 

(2007). Additionally, two more recent projects can be added to this list, the Illinois 

pilot  (IZADI et al., 2018), and the Middle East pilot performed by Total S.A on an 

offshore carbonate reservoir (MOREL et al., 2016) summing up 44 projects.  

From these projects mentioned previously, Sheng (2011), Zhu et al. (2012) 

and Manrique (2007) describe 12 of these projects, and they can be defined as the 

projects more documented in the literature. From this, it can be concluded: (a) most 

of them were done before the 1990s; (b) there are only four applications on 

carbonate reservoirs found in the literature, (c) there has not been any pilot or field 

development reported in Latin America; and (d) there is only one offshore project 

around the world. Some of these pilots are discussed next, including laboratory and 

simulation studies on carbonate rocks, high salinity brines and CEOR optimizations 

on reservoir simulation models. The overall distribution of these projects can be 

found in Figure 3-1.

Next, will be introduced some field implementations, laboratory applications and 

simulation research relevant to this study as a guide for the work developed.  

3.1. LABORATORY TESTS OF SP FLOODING ON HIGH SALINITY AND/OR 

CARBONATE RESERVOIRS  

For the Bramberge reservoir in Germany, it was studied in the laboratory the 

use of an SP program with high salinity production brine, using adsorption inhibitors 

(TABARY et al., 2012). This onshore sandstone reservoir has high permeability, 

averaging 1 Darcy, low temperature (40°C), crude oil of 28.6 API, a water cut close 

to 95%, formation water salinity of 120 g/L and an injection brine with a TDS of 25-

43 g/L. Their research focused on testing the performance of the SP program on 

different brine conditions, including diluting, brine treatments, and inhibitors. They 

concluded that despite softened water (low hardness) and its mixing can help the 

performance of the SP injection on a high salinity brine formation, the treatment 

processes required to achieve the softening makes these alternatives challenging to 

implement on field conditions. Concluding, of these alternatives the mixture including 

adsorption inhibitors was the one with the best results, as it obtained similar 

recoveries as the other alternatives and moreover the adsorption was reduced 50% 

to 70% when compared to the conventional solutions. These results showed the 

viability of a high salinity SP, an opportunity on unconventional scenarios. 

Zaitoun et al. (2003) reported a study for the Chihuido field in Argentina of SP 

flooding at a laboratory scale for high salinity brine. The formation brine salinity 

moves close to 110.000 ppm and around 2.800 ppm TDS, which can be considered 

as high salinity in a sandstone formation. The rock has a porosity moving between 

9 to 27 % and an average permeability of 45mD up to 400 mD, a light oil, 33 to 35 

API, and 55°C. An anionic surfactant for IFT reduction and a sacrificial surfactant 

were evaluated on three experiments: coreflooding, static, and dynamic adsorption. 

The primary and sacrificial surfactant concentration was 0.125%w for each one of 

them, and it was obtained a final recovery of 36%, the lowest IFT measured was of 



15 
 

 
 

0.0036 mN/m and adsorption for the primary surfactant of 0.048 mg/g-rock. The 

study concluded that it is possible to use and SP injection on high salinity formations, 

with low surfactant concentrations and moderate adsorption on the rock. 

Zhu et al. (2013) reported an ASP and SP laboratory study on a 

heterogeneous biostromal carbonate reservoir from Indonesia KS oilfield. The 

research focused on evaluating and comparing the adsorption of different 

surfactants and polymers and their performance under coreflooding. Five different 

polymers were evaluated between polyacrylamides and biopolymers, eleven 

surfactants, including amphoteric, anionic, cationic and non-ionic types, two alkali 

agents, sodium carbonate and sodium phosphate, and a crude oil sample with a 

TAN of 0.09 mg KOH/g. From this research can be highlighted that: (1) the best 

performance on the chemical slug was provided individually by the specially 

manufactured polymers (HPAM) with heat and salt resistances; (2) the ASP with a 

weak alkali and the SP flooding had similar oil recoveries over a water injection 

meaning that the presence of the alkali can be eliminated on a chemical flooding of 

these characteristics; (3) the amphoteric surfactant had one of the best performance 

on both injection programs ASP and SP and its adsorption was of 0.41 mg/g 

considered a viable loss on the reservoir during dynamic conditions. 

Later Levitt et al. (2013), evaluated on a laboratory scale the challenges of 

SP flooding in a low permeability carbonate with high temperature and salinity 

conditions. The methodology consisted of the selection of polymer and surfactants, 

to later evaluate their performance on different core plugs: limestones, sandstone, 

and original reservoir cores. The results pointed out that: (1) there was emulsion 

production while at the same time a build-up pressure was encountered on 

limestones, which did not appear on sandstones, a possible reason was the 

formation of in-situ macroemulsion or capillary pressure in the same order of 

magnitude as the low gradients in the coreflooding test; (2) on laboratory scale exists 

a dispersity effect only obtained on original reservoir core plugs, which affects the oil 

bank formation of the SP flooding directly, resulting in lower recovery factors than 

the expected (a solution may be the use of longer cores); (3) the predictions of the 



16 
 

 
 

capillary desaturation curves are not representative of laboratory data, which 

reaches oil recoveries over 90%, a possible reason is oil solubilization rather than 

mobilization of the trapped oil. 

Also, there have been researches employing chemical for the SP flooding 

from a biological origin. Hongyan et al. (2016) studied the performance of a betaine 

surfactant derived from an oleic acid product of vegetable oil and later compared 

with two surfactants. The study was carried out in a sandstone rock at 85°C, 

containing a low salinity brine 1270 mg/L and crude oil of 36 API gravity. Among the 

tests results, it can be highlighted that the interfacial tension reached desirable 

values, 1x10-3 mN/m, and this was conserved even after 90 days; showing the 

efficiency of the biosurfactant. The remaining saturation of coreflooding test was 

measured using Dean-Stark apparatus and a Soxhlet Extractor. The incremental 

recoveries for two runs of an SP slug were of 16.03% and 14.43% for medium and 

high permeability sandstone cores respectively.  

Another research regarding biochemicals for SP flooding was done by Saudi 

Aramco, where a biosurfactant, four biopolymers, and one HPAM polymer were 

tested in carbonate reservoir sample (ALANIS et al., 2015; ALZAHID et al., 2016). 

The fluids were a crude oil of 30 API, formation brine of 229 g/L TDS and an injection 

brine of 57 g/L TDS, while the rock samples had an average porosity of 19.6% and 

26.1 %. The surfactant had low adsorption of 0.65 mg/g, 0.04 mN/m at a 0.2wt% 

concentration which did not change drastically after long thermal exposure at 

reservoir conditions and resulting in an incremental recovery of 17%. From the five 

polymers, three of them were pre-selected after the compatibility test with the 

formation brine, a Xanthan gum, a Diutan gum, and a HPAM benchmark not 

disclosed. Both biopolymers reached the viscosity target despite some affecting by 

the salinity of the brine, the filtration ratio was acceptable for a polymer concentration 

of 0.1wt%. However, with lower values the filtration was higher than the ones 

obtained with the benchmark; regarding the long-term stability, the Diutan gum 

required higher concentrations as to obtained in the similar long-term characteristics 

as the benchmark while the Xanthan gum maintained its properties. Finally, the 



17 
 

 
 

biopolymers adsorption was lower than the one encountered in the benchmark, and 

the SP coreflooding test had similar results as the HPAM but slightly lower, obtaining 

in an SP flooding 15.5% of incremental recovery only 2.5% lower than the 

benchmark. These results showed that it is feasible using biopolymers and 

biosurfactants for chemical EOR programs and that they can achieve good results. 

Later, Levitt et al. (2016) reported the following step of the previous research, 

which was the evaluation of SP formulation for the Middle East pilot. The formulation 

was designed and optimized by performing close to 5000 microemulsion pipette 

tests, more than forty coreflooding tests, and several thermal stability evaluations as 

to find the best mixture of chemicals. The main requirements for the chemical 

formulation were high salinity and high-temperature tolerance, field injectivity, 

stability at reservoir conditions, and chemical retention on an economic level. The 

reservoir conditions were 83°C, formation brine salinity of 258 g/l, and a carbonate 

rock with 1 to 200 mD. The final formulation contained a manufactured surfactant on 

Total Research labs, and it was an Ethanol ester sulfonate and partially hydrolyzed 

polyacrylamide polymer with calcium and temperature tolerance. Such chemical 

batch obtained on coreflooding tests residual oil saturation of 1 to 8%, which proved 

economically viable. 

A laboratory study was performed by Jabbar et al. (2017) to evaluate the 

applicability of an SP and ASP flooding on an offshore giant carbonate field in the 

Middle East development plan for CEOR injection, which could have pilot 

development on 2018-2019. This research had two objectives: (1) Identifying a 

chemical formulation stable at high salinity (~200000 ppm TDS), low permeability 

(&lt;10 mD) and high temperature conditions (100°C), found on this reservoir; (2) 

evaluating this formulation performance on coreflooding test with representative 

crude oil and rock samples. During this laboratory phase, thermal stability, polymer 

rheology, and microemulsion phase behavior were evaluated. From the evaluated 

polymers, despite salt resistance and adequate rheology results, their thermal 

stability did not show the long thermal stability necessary. On the other way, the 

phase behavior tests (more than 100 were carried out), found optimal formulations 



18 
 

 
 

with high optimal salinities, for the SP 63000 ppm TDS and the ASP 57000 ppm 

TDS, the surfactants were large hydrophobe alkoxy carboxylate and sulfonates. 

Finally, the coreflooding results were encouraging, with a final recovery for the SP 

injection of 97% and 93.5 for the ASP, however more studies were decided as to 

improve the high surfactant adsorption which was considered not economically 

viable. 

3.2. OFFSHORE STATUS 

On the literature as described previously, the number of SP projects is not 

large, and there has been only one report of SP flooding implementation in an 

offshore reservoir. In this section is described some offshore ASP projects which can 

serve as a reference of the challenges a mixed chemical flooding at offshore 

conditions can encounter, and their corresponding performance.  

On the Bob Slaughter Block (ADAMS; SCHIEVELBEIN, 1987; MANRIQUE; 

MUCI; GURFINKEL, 2007b), there were reported two pilots of SP flooding in the 

’80s specifically in the San Andres dolomite reservoir. The reservoir has an average 

depth of 5000 ft and 109°F, it had a crude oil of 31°API, and it was under water 

injection 21 years approximately when two SP pilots were performed. Both 

configurations consisted of two-well patterns, and their formulations consisted of the 

injection of petroleum sulfonates and a biopolymer. The first pilot began at April 

1981, and it had a mixture of petroleum sulfonate and alkyl ether sulfate, injected on 

a period of 171 days and a displacing batch of polymer solution mixed with fresh 

water for almost 140 days, having a final recovery of 77%. The second pilot had a 

formulation of petroleum sulfonate and an alkyl ether sulfate, injected by 61 days 

and later a polymer slug for 45 days, with a final recovery of 43% considered 

promising. 

The Sabiriyaj Mauddud carbonate reservoir, in North Kuwait under waterflood 

development, was screened at the 2000s for EOR techniques that were possible to 



19 
 

 
 

implement. A six steps program was carried out to find the most adequate 

technology to be implemented: (1) sector model simulation, evaluating competing 

EOR processes, (2) laboratory studies on surfactant and polymer floods, (3) 

UTCHEM simulation, replicating lab results, (4) migration from UTCHEM results to 

a 3D sector model, (5) fine grid simulation study for the pilot area and (6) Single Well 

Chemical Tracer tests (SWCT). During the first step, it was found that an SP injection 

was favorable and could increase 41%the recovery factor. In the second step, it was 

established the most effective chemical formulation for the rock and reservoir fluid 

samples, using those results as input for the phases 3 to 5. Later, the SWCT was 

carried out, for this, it was selected the wells with assuring the most representative 

and with better benefits. The SWCT consists shortly of soaking some meters of the 

formation with the chemical formulation and keeping it closed for some days, later 

back producing the well which recovers higher volumes of oil due to the chemicals 

in contact with the formation. Preliminary it was obtained an increment of 20% of oil 

recovered. Due to the results of the laboratory, simulation phase, and the SWCT, an 

inverted five spot model was planned to be carried out in 2016/2017 (ZUBARI; 

SIVAKUMAR, 2003; CARLISLE et al., 2014; ABDULLAH; TIWARI; PATHAK, 2015; 

FORTENBERRY et al., 2016). 

Regarding offshore applications of ASP projects, Chaco et al. (2003) describe 

the design of an ASP system for La Salina Field, Venezuela and, although there are 

no reports of application, it is worth noticing that it was a complete study covering 

from laboratory design, numerical simulation and facilities design for an offshore 

field. A sandstone reservoir presenting a medium gravity crude oil of 25°API, 18000 

ft depth, with a history production of more than 60 years and a water injection plan 

of more than 20 years. On the laboratory phase, 23 surfactants, two alkalines 

(sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate) and five partially hydrolyzed 

polyacrylamide polymers were evaluated with softened water and crude oil from the 

field (a Total Acid Number – TAN of 0.56 mg KOH/g). In this lab phase fluid 

compatibility, interfacial tension screening, phase behavior, polymer rheology, 

adsorption behaviors, and radial coreflooding tests were performed to obtain the 

optimal chemical injection for the reservoir formation (La Rosa). The final formula 



20 
 

 
 

consisted of 0.75%w/w of Na2CO3, 0.1%w/w alkyl aryl sulfonate and 800mg/l HPAM. 

Regarding the numerical simulation, a history match for waterflooding (real field 

data) and chemical flooding (radial corefloods and fluids data) was performed for 24 

wells (producers and injectors) considering different forecast. The injection order 

was first waterflooding, later ASP solution, followed by a polymer drive, and lately 

water. All estimates got an incremental oil production of at least 31%. About the 

facilities design, it was considered a three years pilot, having as main construction 

requirements: (1) a dissolving, mixing and injection plant according to the chemical 

volume need planned on the laboratory phase, (2) a water treatment plant, (3) an 

appropriate tubing array to transport the mixture from plant to injectors and (4) the 

offshore platform with capacity to hold the ASP and water treatment plants. Their 

main conclusions were: (1) the oil recovery increment in the laboratory was 

significant, (2) fluids behavior and screening tests are required as primordial for the 

economic viability of the pilot, (3) the numerical simulation showed good 

performance of the ASP method for different well scenarios and (4) the design and 

construction of the offshore plant must follow the recommendations of the lab and 

simulation results. 

The St Joseph offshore field in Malaysia is another offshore ASP system 

project found in the literature (CHAI et al., 2011; DU et al., 2011). The pilot study 

was focused on reservoirs containing a medium gravity oil and a chemical injection 

using an already existing waterflooding project from which facilities could be reused. 

The evaluation was performed on a numerical simulation basis, where both polymer 

and ASP flood were evaluated versus the water injection program already done (with 

gas injection). For the chemical EOR parameters, such as IFT, adsorption, and 

rheology, some generic set was used and later, a sensitivity study brought the 

polymer constraints, chemical slug size. A previously 3D model history matching was 

employed for the evaluation and run on a Shell in-house reservoir simulator. 

Additionally, some redevelopment activities were simulated: (1) rim infill wells to 

accelerate oil production and improve project economics, (2) stopping of oil migration 

into attic region (reduced by gas injection stopping and increasing pressure by fluid 

injection). The corresponding increment in Recovery Factor by infill wells was 7%, 



21 
 

 
 

polymer 13%, and ASP 20%. On their study, they describe the equipment required 

to implement, on a full field scale, and resembles the one mentioned previously for 

La Salina field. Moreover, some risks and challenges associated with the EOR 

technique and the offshore implementation were: (1) logistical challenges related to 

the supply chain of chemicals, (2) operators require training regarding the EOR 

method, (3) the waterflood infrastructure is relatively old, so rejuvenation and 

integrity maintenance is needed, (4) emulsion handling and disposal, including back 

produced chemicals on the facilities, (5) chemical discharge associated to produced 

water, (6) high adsorption of chemicals, (6) localized heterogeneities affecting the 

objective observation of the results, (7) unconstrained fracture growth on the rock 

(more viscous fluid injected) and (8) measuring the saturation of oil accurately on the 

observation well during the pilot phase. 

A joint Shell and PETRONAS evaluation of the technical challenges of 

implementing an ASP flooding in three offshore producing fields in northern Borneo 

with a focus on space solution (KOVALEV et al., 2016). For it, four anchor cases 

were detailed and analyzed: (1) high injection, (2) medium injection, (3) low injection, 

and (4) only polymer. For the first case, the chemical delivery system was based 

onshore, with a water intake for the water treatment plant from the nearshore area 

and the ASP mixture prepared and transported to injection points by pipelines. The 

second was based on a floater concept, where the chemicals are supplied from 

manufacturers to the Chemical Delivery System and stored in a vessel hull. The third 

was based on two injection hubs; the first only focused on one field and a second 

supplying the chemicals to the other two. The fourth case was based solely in 

polymer reducing costs, intermediate chemical storage onshore, and ASP mixture 

delivered only for two fields and no cocktail injection on the third one. For all three 

fields were fixed alkaline, polymer and co-solvent, while the surfactant may vary 

between fields. A simulation phase was performed using geological and fluid models, 

to understand and evaluate the field dynamics, production profiles, and injection 

rates using the in-house reservoir simulator MoRes. Regarding the facilities scope, 

the two focuses were the Chemical Delivery System (CDS) and Produced Fluid 

Handling, the first treats and prepares ASP mixture while the second one break 



22 
 

 
 

downs the emulsion and treats oil and water. The CDS brought to the analysis the 

necessity of higher power demand (which means that a fuel source is needed, either 

gas or other), a pneumatic conveying system to load/offload the chemicals required 

and a structure and weight capacity increase. The production facilities must handle 

the presence of chemical back produced, which will affect the performance of the 

surface facilities by forming very stable microemulsions, polymer viscosifying the 

produced water, foam generation by residual surfactant and chemical toxicity. 

Concluding, new technologies regarding water treatment, capable of reducing water 

and energy consumption; a single chemical formulation is preferable, so no 

additional storage facilities are needed, currently polymer makes 10% of the 

chemical cost, while surfactant and alkaline cover the other 90% which brings cost 

issues deepen if the design does not cover the possible adsorption of the chemicals 

on the rock.  

Another field test was performed by Total S.A in the Middle East in 2014, 

which was the first offshore pilot on an offshore carbonate reservoir with high salinity 

formation brine of 230g/L, high temperature (80-90°C) and low permeability ranging 

from 30-100 mD (AL-AMRIE et al., 2015; MOREL et al., 2016). The formulation 

employed consisted of an SP slug of 1.35%w active surfactant in an 80 g/l brine and 

a polymer drive with softened seawater. The well configuration selected was a one-

spot, after evaluating time for drilling (not required), workovers (only one needed), 

pilot duration (30 days), relative costs and overall complexity (confinement and no 

platform difficulties). Despite the laboratory design, there were risks which could 

result in the failure of the project or its modification accord to the planes and 

countermeasures studied; they were: Well integrity failure, Single Well Tracer Test 

failure, SP/P failure, and chemical quality-related risks. The second risk was 

materialized due to poor injectivity, resulting in a change of the program to a 

surfactant plus brine injection after back producing the SP batch. Despite the 

challenges and risks, it was categorized as a success as safety was maintained 

during all the project, a significant oil desaturation was achieved, the tracer injection 

was a success as it helps evaluate the uncertainties on porosity channels, residual 



23 
 

 
 

oil saturation, and reservoir dispersity. It was reporting a reduction of oil saturation 

of approximately 4 units of saturation within 1 meter around the well. 

Izadi et al. (2018) reported a technically successful SP injection on a pilot 

scale on the Illinois basin. The pilot had four injectors and nine producers, where oil 

production increased up to twenty times in offset producers. The development of the 

pilot followed a laboratory study, a numerical simulation model and implementation 

of the pilot. The chemical blend was made up of an HPAM polymer at 2500 ppm and 

a blend of three anionic surfactants at 0.7%w. This article was the following part of 

the laboratory research explained in section 3.1. 

As was observed in this state of the art, there are various opportunities 

relating the SP flood on carbonate rock in offshore reservoirs. Among them, finding 

chemicals appropriate to those conditions is needed; evaluating their performance 

only in the laboratory is not enough, a simulation phase composed of global 

sensitivity analysis and optimization taking into account the variables interacting 

such as concentrations, injection profiles and economic scenarios can bring answers 

more realistic to, how feasible this type of program in no traditional scenarios which 

are the offshore fields and carbonate reservoir exploiting. 

3.3. NUMERICAL SIMULATION 

In the literature, there are some simulation-based studies for SP flooding, 

evaluating the economic viability, the finding of optimal parameters and conditions 

for its application, by using different optimization techniques and sensitivity analysis, 

some of them are detailed next. There are other simulations works having as scope 

ASP, AS, Surfactant and polymer optimization and evaluation, but studying them is 

not within the objectives of this research, therefore are not described here. 

A sensitivity and optimization of a quarter spot model were performed for an 

SP, and ASP injections in mixed-wet dolomite, where the optimum design was 

selected based on the net present value (ANDERSON et al., 2006) and the input 



24 
 

 
 

data was obtained from previously performed tests. The reservoir had water cut 

about 98%, average porosity of 16%, average permeability of 156 mD, a 31°API oil 

and brine with 60315 ppm of TDS. Sensitivity analysis was based on 21 simulation 

runs where it was analyzed the slug size, chemical concentrations, salinity, polymer 

mass, surfactant and polymer adsorption, heterogeneity, and the capillary 

desaturation curve. All the previous runs were later analyzed using the concept of 

discounted cash flow analysis, where crude oil price and surfactant cost were varied 

as to obtain different NPV and subsequently selecting the two optimal. These were 

the cases where low surfactant adsorption was selected, and a higher polymer 

concentration as defined. 

Later, Mollaei et al. (2011) performed a global sensitivity analysis of the SP 

process, using an analytical chemical flood predictive model which calculates the 

ultimate recovery efficiency as a product of volumetric sweep efficiency, 

displacement efficiency and the efficiency of the mobility buffer. A database of 1381 

onshore fields was collected and used for this study and the results of each case on 

the analytical model. Their research used a sensitivity analysis called Winding Stairs 

which requires a smaller number of runs than a Monte Carlo method and identifies 

the individual and total effect of each parameter studied on the sensitivity, helping to 

identify the interrelations between variables and their respective uncertainty. For this 

study, the settings studied were: surfactant concentration, surface density, pattern, 

interfacial tension, rock density, adsorption, water viscosity, oil viscosity, net 

thickness, heterogeneity, residual oil saturation, and porosity. It can be highlighted 

of their research that the previously mentioned parameters (permeability, porosity, 

heterogeneity, and oil viscosity) brought the higher uncertainty either individually or 

by interacting with others on the performance of the SP flooding. Nor economic 

variables were studied, and neither offshore fields were evaluated on the original 

database. 

One year later, Alsofi et al. (2012) performed a similar study also using 

coreflooding test data for a carbonate sample, followed by sensitivity analysis and 

an optimization process was carried out as to evaluate the performance of and SP 



25 
 

 
 

flooding on a 1D model resembling the coreflooding. The rock and test condition 

were: 90°C, pore pressure of 21MPa, 0.2% of polymer and surfactant concentration, 

and brine with 84715 ppm of TDS. The methodology followed was: (1) laboratory 

design, (2) model construction based on laboratory data, (3) base runs, (4) tuning 

and history matching of the coreflooding, (4) sensitivity analysis and (5) numerical 

optimization. The sensitivity analysis evaluated different parameters on the 

UTCHEM software used for the simulation of the numerical models; while the 

optimization was performed by running ten scenarios where chemical concentration, 

slug sizes, and chemical consumption were performed. It was found that the 

simulation run could not obtain the asymmetrical oil banking profile observed in the 

laboratory test; the sensitivity test showed that the oil recovery of the SP injection 

varied greatly as the IFT is modified and the optimization phase indicated that a high 

polymer to surfactant concentration ratio could bring more effective results. 

Alsofi. Liu and Han (2013) studied the SP flooding numerical simulation using 

laboratory data experiments on a carbonate rock. The study was based on five 

coreflooding tests where slug size, chemicals concentrations, and brine salinity were 

evaluated at reservoir conditions 21 MPa and 90°C. After it, a simulation model was 

constructed, and history matched as to reflect the injection and later optimized by 

simulating 10 cases varying the parameters mentioned and including a chemical 

consumption. It was found: (1) despite a reasonable consistency between simulation 

and experiment was found, the model could not model the oil banking profile; (2) 

there is a direct relationship between the IFT reduction and higher recovery volumes; 

(3) the slug size affected the final oil recovery however it varied only between 3-1%; 

and (4) optimal results were found on high Polymer to surfactant ratio 

concentrations. 

Al-Dousari and Garrouch (2013) introduced an artificial neural network model 

for SP flooding evaluation based on 18 dimensionless parameters defined on 

another research and the associated results of 624 model runs. In their study is 

explained how the proposed model was constructed looking for the optimal selection 

of hidden layer and neurons, and later a training phase with a set of 499 simulated 



26 
 

 
 

responds and 125 field cases to validate its results. Concluding that the model it’s 

an alternative to evaluate the oil recovery of SP injections with less computational 

cost as the traditional simulators. 

Bahrami et al. (2016) proposed Genetic programming as a methodology to 

estimate the  RF and the NPV in an SP flooding and later optimizing it based on 

selected parameters. The methodology followed the compilation of 202 data points 

of a sandstone reservoir and their corresponding economic evaluation. The 

parameters used as input variables for the Genetic Programming were slug sizes, 

chemical concentrations, salinity, and the ratio between vertical and horizontal 

permeabilty having as output the RF and the NPV. Their algorithm picked 161 data 

for training and 41 for testing the program, and two models were developed one for 

the RF and another for the NPV. It was presented for both models an accuracy of 

0.963 and 0.946 on their residual square, showing a high correspondence; with this 

result and the advantage of not requiring a fundamental description of the physical 

properties of the model makes it a possible method to evaluate the performance of 

injection programs. Regarding the optimized input parameters, all had a positive 

effect and a direct relationship with the RF model. As for the NPV, the variables of 

slug size and surfactant concentration had both a positive and a negative effect 

associated with higher recovered volumes but higher associated costs. These 

showed themselves effective; however, an optimization base on economic 

uncertainties should be considered as they also have a high impact on the project 

results. 

Kamari et al. (2016) presented two models to evaluate the recovery factor and 

NPV of SP flooding for sandstone oil reservoir, obtained using the Least Square 

Support Vector Machine methodology (LSSVM). This methodology can be described 

as a supervised learning method in which a set of data is analyzed based on several 

input and output variables to recognize patterns and to solve classification problems 

with a set of linear equations. For this research, a databank of SP flooding models 

using UTCHEM simulator was used, this data bank included for each case seven 

input variables and two outputs, RF and NPV. This set was later divided into three 



27 
 

 
 

sub-dataset, training, validating and testing as to develop the models with the 

LSSVM. Their results concluded that the models for the NPV and RF brought 

acceptable results, and the total correlation coefficient for both of them was 0.993. 

Also, after executing a sensitivity analysis, they found that the slug size and 

surfactant concentration had the most significant impact on the RF model, while for 

the NPV the surfactant and polymer concentration had the most significant effect on 

the NPV model.

4. METHODOLOGY 

The methodology followed in this research can be divided into five steps, as 

observed in Figure 4-1: 

Figure 4-1 Research flowchart divided into steps 

 

Source: Author, 2019. 

1. Defining input information for waterflooding, Polymer flooding, and Surfactant-

Polymer flooding from laboratory test and literature. For this research, polymer 

viscosity was evaluated on a laboratory level, while for the surfactant, parameters 

such as interfacial tension, adsorption, and CMC data was taken from the 

literature. A screening of three available surfactants was carried out in the 

laboratory, were adsorption and CMC were obtained. Having as main objective 

to evaluate what should be the expected behavior of different types of surfactant 

at this reservoir conditions and later selecting based on these results one 

chemical fulfilling the requirements of adsorption, CMC and IFT behavior. 



29 
 

 
 

2. Building and adapting the pilot reservoir models objective of the research, one 

based on main Lula’s field properties and the Cerena-I (based on Jupiter 

Field)(FABUSUYI, 2015). 

3. Building two additional models, low and high permeability, with the same 

characteristics as the two base models, having as their main difference the 

average absolute permeability in each direction: lower heterogeneity case and 

higher heterogeneity case. 

4. Conducting numerical simulations for each one of them on the previous 

geological models to obtain the first output data. The main information for the 

chemical injection programs was: interfacial tension as a salinity function, 

adsorption as a function of the surfactant concentration, and polymer viscosity 

behavior (obtained from steps 1 and 2). 

5. Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of each simulation of the previous step 

for each economic scenario and optimize the selected parameters for the case-

scenarios using the PSO. 

6. Evaluation of the optimal values/solutions in the previous step. 

7. Calculate the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) for each injection program 

considering the maximized NPVs on steps 3 and 4. 

8. Discussed and evaluate the results for all three injections on all the models, Lula 

based, and Jupiter based as to define how plausible it’s the SP flooding in the 

scenarios defined when compared with other techniques. 

4.1. LABORATORY PHASE 

At first, it must be mentioned that microemulsion phase behavior tests or 

direct characterization of the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and 

the crude oil is one of the inputs for the simulation and such tests were not carried 



30 
 

 
 

out in this laboratory work. The microemulsion phase behavior requires many tests 

and several screenings to select the best surfactants for the reservoir conditions, 

requiring, therefore, research focused on it. Moreover, the lack of dead crude oil on 

our facilities and equipment to measure ultra-low interfacial tensions (~1*10-3 mN/m) 

made its evaluation unavailable. 

In this way, the CMC determination and surfactant adsorption of available 

surfactants in the saline medium and, also required for the simulation were used as 

reference parameters to search in the literature, experimental data from a chemical 

with similar or better performance, including, the ultra-low interfacial values.  

This chapter describes the chemicals and solutions prepared to obtain the 

surfactant adsorption, surfactant critical micelle concentration (CMC) and polymer 

viscosity. This latter is also a required parameter for the simulation phase.  

4.1.1. Surfactant 

Three surfactants were characterized in the initial laboratory screening phase 

to study their behavior, in a high salinity medium, specifically regarding the CMC and 

adsorption behavior: anionic, cationic, and non-ionic samples.  

? Anionic: Sodium C14 -16 Olefin Sulfonate, 315 g/mol, liquid at 39.1 % active. 

? Cationic: Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 364.45 g/mol, solid 

powder, 98% active.  

? Non-ionic: Oleyl cetyl alcohol Ethylene oxide, Molecular weight not specified, 

solid paste, 99 % active.  



31 
 

 
 

4.1.2. Polymer 

A Xanthan gum was selected because of its divalent cations tolerance and 

degradation temperature over 80°C (higher than pre-salt value). It was used for the 

laboratory phase a 200 mesh sample provided by Labsynth, and for the simulation 

phase, it was assumed a molecular weight of 2x106 Da (ROSALAM; ENGLAND, 

2006). 

The rheological behavior of the polymer was obtained in the laboratory 

following a power law model, as it is described in the next sections.  

4.1.3. Brine 

A base high salinity synthetic brine resembling the one that could be produced 

in an offshore facility to be later treated and reinjected on the reservoir (Table 

4.1.3-1) is being used for the laboratory phase of this research. 

Table 4.1.3-1 Synthetic Brine composition.  

Synthetic Brine 
composition 

Na+ (ppm) 29505 

Cl- (ppm) 63799 

Mg2+ (ppm) 4066 

Ca2+ (ppm) 6993 

TDS (ppm) 104361 

4.1.4. Critical Micelle Concentration Determination 

In order to determine the CMC of surfactant, it is employed surface tension with 

the methodology described by Mukerjee &amp;amp; Mysels (1971). This procedure bases in 



32 
 

 
 

measuring the surface tension of different surfactant concentrations in the same 

brine and later plotting the results against the logarithm of the respective 

concentration. A sharp decline is observed after which the curve will behave 

relatively horizontal (almost constant surface tension) as can be observed in Figure

known as the CMC. A Du Noüy ring tensiometer – Kruss Company, model K6 was 

used on this research (Figure 4.1.4-2).

Some key procedural points of the test were: 

? The test was performed with two different solutions; the first was a distilled water, 

and the second one a brine with a NaCl concentration of 70 g/l.  



33 
 

 
 

? Triplicate measurements were taken, so the average and standard deviation per 

point could be registered in plotted graphs. 

? Each CMC point was obtained intersecting the line trends and solving their 

corresponding equations for the two sections to get the most precise coordinate.  

? Before each series of measurements, the device must be calibrated with 

demineralized water, so the surface tension at 20°C was expected to be 72-73 

mN/m. 

? The solution must be a sample from the middle of the bottle, so no excess was 

measured in the surface and only the bulk in the center. 

4.1.5. Surfactant Adsorption 

In addition to the required chemical parameters previously mentioned, the 

surfactant adsorption is also a parameter used in the simulation. The surfactant 

adsorption behavior should be reviewed as it depends on surfactant type, 

concentration, rock minerals, temperature, pH, the flow rate of the solution, among 

others (SHENG, 2011). It can be evaluated either in a dynamic or static test, 

however, for this research scope, only the latter one was performed 

(SHAMSIJAZEYI; HIRASAKI; VERDUZCO, 2013; PARK; LEE; SULAIMAN, 2015; 

LI et al., 2016).  

For the static adsorption, the surfactants are dissolved in the synthetic 

formation brine at different concentrations, later rock dolomitic carbonate powder 

sieved in a 100-200 mesh is mixed with the solution for 24 hours in a 1:50 mass ratio 

at room temperature. The mixture is filtered, and the supernatant is titrated to 

determine the residual surfactant concentration (a potentiometric titrator version 916 

Ti-Touch from Metrohm) and later constructing the adsorption curve for cationic and 

anionic surfactants. As for nonionic the surfactant, the methodology followed was 

based on comparing the surface tension of a baseline solution of surfactant and 

brine, against the surface tension of the supernatant fluid after being in contact with 



34 
 

 
 

the rock powder, a procedure detailed by Kaln (2009). The formula to find the 

adsorption on milligrams of surfactant adsorbed per grams of rock is the next one,

Where Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the 

adsorbate, M is the mass of adsorbate solution in contact with the adsorbent and 

grock is the weight of the adsorbent used 

4.1.6. Polymer evaluation 

To evaluate the polymer, the American Petroleum Institute (API) 

Recommended Practice 63 “Recommended Practices for evaluation of Polymers 

used in Enhanced Oil Recovery Operations” was followed, in addition to other 

relevant literature (AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, 1990).  

The polymer viscosity requirement was based on crude oil viscosity. So, a 

polymeric solution slightly above the crude oil viscosity is searched (SHENG; 

LEONHARDT; AZRI, 2015; LEVITT et al., 2016). Four polymeric solutions in a brine 

solution (Table 2) with concentrations of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 ppm were 

prepared. For each one, 4 measures of viscosity were obtained employing a model 

35 Fann viscometer (Figure 4.1.6-1). Next, it is briefly explained the procedure 

followed to obtain the viscosity measurement as a shear rate function (AMERICAN 

PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, 1990). 

1. Measure the viscosity of the solution at four rotor speeds: 100, 200, 300, 600 

rpm. Starting at the lowest velocity and going upward. 

2. Calculate the viscosity of each point following a Power Law model. For this 

research purpose, it was employed the model described by Bourgoyne et al. 

(1986):

Where ?, K, n and ? are the apparent viscosity, in cP, consistency index in 

units of pounds force per second per square feet; flow-behavior index and 

shear rate in s-1 respectively.  

3. Plot the data obtained as viscosity versus shear rate, specifying the polymer 

concentration.

4.2. SIMULATION PHASE 

In this chapter, it is shown and highlighted the main stages to build two 3D 

numeric models by BUILDER v.2017, later run on STARS v.2018 and GEM v.2016.2 

simulators (Thermal &amp;amp; Advanced Process Reservoir Simulator; Compositional &amp;amp; 

Unconventional Reservoir Simulator, both from CMG). The version of GEM 

employed allowed the modeling of microemulsion behavior not available on their 

next releases.  



36 
 

 
 

The simulation phase was divided into several steps, as can be seen in 

Figure 4.2-1. First, the collection of laboratory and literature data from the previous 

phase and information required for the reservoir model construction, including fluid, 

rock, and chemistry characteristics. This step includes generating a model 

resembling the information of a Brazilian, offshore field specifically for the Santos 

Basin. Additionally, a second model is adapted, CERENA I model, which is a 

synthetic reservoir model built by the CERENA Research group to resemble the 

Jupiter field. From this full field model, a pilot size model was taken and adapted 

from Fabusuyi (2015) research. Finally, the construction of the economic model to 

evaluate the performance of all three injection programs: WF, PF, and SP; and 

selection of the output data to be analyzed in the simulations results for each inverted 

five spot model (IFS).  

Second, the simulation of three cases was carried out for each IFS model: 

water flooding, as the base case, polymer flooding, as EOR comparative case; and 

SP flood, as the study case. For each one of the cases, an optimization of 

parameters was carried out, under three economic scenarios, and three 

heterogeneous models were the average permeability in all three directions was 

multiplied by a factor as to account for this uncertainty. The water cut and Net 

Present Value were optimized using the Integrated Analysis &amp;amp; Optimization Tool – 

CMOST, from CMG package. This phase analyses the results obtained for each 

case, individually, and reviews the performance to observe the advantages and 

disadvantages of the SP flood, on a typical water flooding and conventional chemical 

flooding as the Polymer injection. For this study case, it is analyzed the operation 

parameters and rock-fluid/fluid-fluid phenomena, inside the porous media.  

Third, based on the results of both inverted five spot models, average 

cumulative production per well, recovery factor and optimal parameters, the water 

injection and the SP flood processes are evaluated. With this approach, it is possible 

to verify how the SP program operates in a theoretical model and a more realistic 

case.  



37 
 

 
 

The Cerena Field and the inverted five-spot model were adapted from 

Fabusuyi and Pinto's researches (MADEIRA, 2014; FABUSUYI, 2015) from Petrel 

and Eclipse to the BUILDER module from CMG, to be later simulated on the 

Reservoir Simulator GEM. For this work, it was assumed that the PVT results, 

petrophysics, and structural properties of the reservoir are well defined, and no 

further change or evaluation is required. The PVT data used was the same employed 

by Pinto’s research, meaning that it was not required matching of laboratory / 

literature data. The inverted five spot model was used for this research to keep the 

benchmark of the Cerena model.

5. CASE STUDY 

Two models were studied in this research, one constructed by taking the 

information of the literature of the Lula field, and a second one, more complex, 

extracted from a previously full field-built model based on the Jupiter field. Both 

studies were carried out to have a broader view of how the chemical methodologies 



38 
 

 
 

compare in different scenarios of the pre-salt basin. A second reason for the 

simultaneous study in both models, was to avoid not conclusive results regarding 

any of the parameters, for example, as will be mentioned later in the results section, 

one of the models presented injectivity problems, an issue which limited the analysis 

of some parameters selected. 

Both models differ in properties such as API, porosity, wettability, Original Oil 

in Place and pressures, even when these fields are members of the same basin. 

An inverted five spot configuration was selected for both models to keep the 

benchmark of the Cerena model carried out by other researches (MADEIRA, 2014; 

FABUSUYI, 2015). 

5.1. INVERTED FIVE SPOT MODELS DESCRIPTION 

5.1.1. Cerena-I 

The Cerena-I synthetic model is a replica of some of the common 

characteristics of a Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate, specifically the Jupiter field. The 

initial model is a corner-point grid with 161x161x300 cells, with 25x25x1m 

dimensions. It is composed of three blocks and two facies each, a microbiolite 

reservoir facie and a mudstone non-reservoir facie (MADEIRA, 2014). The porosity 

and permeability distributions and lateral view of the reservoir can be observed in 

Figure 5.1.1-1 and Figure 5.1.1-2 respectively, where can be seen the representation 

of the facies mentioned before with a large number of cells with low porosity and low 

permeability, and a smaller quantity of cells corresponding to the microbiolite facies 

with larger porosities and permeabilities.

For the evaluation of each injection program, it was selected the sector model 

extracted by Fabusuyi (2015) on his research of the middle block of the Cerena 

model, with its corresponding characteristics worked by him. It was decided on this 

research to maintain the same pattern of the wells to keep the benchmark of the 

model for future works.

The wells positioning in the reservoir model corresponds to an inverted five-

spot, this configuration has four vertical producers, and one injector in the center 

observed in Figure 5.1.1-3. The model does not present aquifer neither gas cap, 

formed by a 22x22x154 cells grid and 50 m x 50 m x 2 m dimensions, with porosity 

and permeability following the distribution found in Figure 5.1.1-4.

5.1.2. Lula based model 

A 3D geological reservoir model was built in the BUILDER module, to be later 

simulated on the Reservoir Simulator STARS. For the builder input data, it is 

assumed, an entire heterogeneous reservoir saturated with oil and water, over its 

bubble point so that no gas phase could be encountered at the initiation of the model. 

The wells positioning in the reservoir model corresponds to an inverted five-

spot, this configuration has four vertical producers and one injector in the center, 

without aquifer and gas cap, formed by a 20x20x7 cells grid and 200 ft x 200 ft x 29 

ft (Figure 5.1.2-1), with porosity and permeability following a normal and lognormal 

distribution respectively. Moreover, the properties were fixed, so it resembles a 

carbonate offshore reservoir with medium oil.

5.2. ROCK AND FLUID PROPERTIES  

 

In this section, it is presented the rock and fluid properties employed as input 

for both models, Cerena-I and the Lula based model. 



42 
 

 
 

5.2.1. Cerena-I  

The Cerena I field properties resemble the Jupiter field in Brazil; therefore the 

IFS model extracted has the same properties as for their initialization. Table 5.2.1-1 

describes these characteristics. In Figure 5.2.1-1 and  

Figure 5.2.1-2, can be found the relative permeability curves employed in the 

model based on Fabusuyi’s work (2015). Where can be observed a medium-wet 

rock tendency.

To evaluate the geological uncertainty, two additional models were 

constructed by multiplying all the permeability distribution (i, j and k directions) of the 

base model by factors of 2 and 0.5 for the high and low permeability cases 

respectively, as described in Table 5.2.1-2. This was performed as to take into 

account, the heterogeneity uncertainties a regular EOR pilot has to encounter during 

its development (in this case smaller and larger permeabilities in all directions), 

which will affect the future expansion of the recovery technology on a larger scale.

5.3. RESERVOIR FLUIDS MODEL 

5.3.1. Cerena-I 

The reservoir fluid model is the one described by Fabusuyi (2015) constructed 

to resemble the one found in the analogs field, Jupiter. The reservoir oil composition 

and PVT model follows the characteristics of an 18°API oil with a high CO2 content

close to 55% molar, and a gas cap of retrograde gas with close to 60% of CO2. The 

molar percentages of the oil pseudo components are described in Table 5.3.1-1, 

and their properties in Table 5.3.1-2. As it was mentioned previously in this work, it 

was assumed that PVT, petrophysics and structure properties of the reservoir are 

well defined, and no further change or evaluation is required. This assumption was 

considered to no change the benchmark model. 

The oil viscosity curve and the phase diagram can be observed in Figure 

5.3.1-1 and Figure 5.3.1-2. In the phase diagram, the bubble point pressure is 49300

5.3.2. Lula based model 

 

The reservoir oil composition and PVT model follows the characteristics of a 

medium crude oil (approx. 28°API) with a high CO2 content of 17.84%, resembling 

the ones found in Lula’s field and described by Elias Junior (2015). The PVT and 

composition were input data for the Phase Behavior &amp;amp; Fluid Property Program called 

Winprop from CMG and exported into the model. It was used the component lumping 

option to reduce a total of 25 components to 9 pseudo components, Table 5.3.2-1

5.4. ECONOMIC MODELS 

All EOR methods: water, polymer and SP flooding were optimized under the 

water cut and NPV for both IFS models. The economic scenarios were built following 

a simplified Brazilian regime, having as main taxes and contribution variables 

presented in Table 5.4-1.

For all cases, the net present value was discounted by an investment covering 

the drilling and completion of wells, production platform, and abandonment. The 

economic parameters are resumed in Table 5.4-2 and were based on the individual 

works of several researchers (ALSOFI et al., 2013; SAMPAIO et al., 2013; SHENG, 

2014; GASPAR et al., 2015; SCHIOZER, 2015). As fior the project time a maximum 

of 30 years was selected for both, Lula and Cerena, however, if the shut-in 

constraints were reached before this limit the project was finished earlier.

GASPAR et al., 2015; SCHIOZER, 2015 

For the Lula based IFS, despite there are four producer’s wells, it is important 

to highlight that each one of them is occupying only one-fourth of the well capacity. 

Therefore, the costs only represent the total expenditure for two wells, one injector, 

and one producer, the latter divided into four sections (exploration and platform 

investment). The platform cost depends of the fluid rates expected in the project; 

therefore, it was higher for the Cerena than for the Lula. 

Moreover, being more specific, for the calculation of the investments 

abandonment and fluids related cost, it was employed the values state by Schiozer 



51 
 

 
 

et al. (2015). While the chemical facility cost was assumed as five percent (5%) of 

the platform investment base on AlSofi et al. (2013) research which employed a 

similar relation between both expenditures in a polymer flooding optimization. The 

facilities and treatment for the salinity content of the water injected was no taken into 

account in this research however it can increase the associated costs of the 

technology. 

To assess the performance of the SP flooding, if compared with a polymer 

flooding and water injection, both optimized, an Expected Monetary Value (EMV) 

methodology alongside a derivation three analysis was used. For both inverted five 

spot models, it was considered three levels of reservoir heterogeneity and economic 

scenarios. These evaluation schemes can be observed in Figure 5.4-1. For the 

evaluation, each branch from the tree was assigned with a percentage weight for the 

final EMV calculation. 

Figure 5.4-1 Derivation tree analysis for the inverted five-spot models. 

 

Source: Author, 2019  

For the EMV, it was applied a simple multiplication between the weight 

percentage of the branch, the model probability (30% and 40%) and the 



52 
 

 
 

corresponding NPV. Finally, the results for each branch were summed up to 

calculate the EMV for each EOR methodology for each model, either WF, PF or SP. 

The economic parameters considered for each optimization are presented in 

Table 5.4-3. Aiming at a balanced comparison between the water, polymer and SP 

injection programs, it was carried out optimization for all cases employing CMOST 

module from CMG, specifically the PSO having as objective function the NPV.

Finally, the EMV for each injection program is compared, and the highest 

value is the one which brings the highest added value to the reservoir production 

program. 

5.5. OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS 

In this section, it will be shown the operational conditions and constraints with 

each model was run in every economic scenario and IOR project. 

5.5.1. CERENA-I 

For this research, it is being considered the drilling of five wells for both 

models. In Table 5.5.1-1 it is shown the operational conditions assumed for the 

author for production and injection wells of the Cerena I - IFS.

For this model, the injection program starts after reaching an average 

pressure in all cells of 49299.6 kPa (bubble pressure). This was declared, accounting 

for a slower pressure decline after the bubble point.  

The optimized parameters and the upper and lower limits are described in 

Table 5.5.1-2. For the IFS-Cerena, it was optimized the maximum oil rate, minimum 

bottom hole pressure, water cut to shut in each producer well, the minimum average 

reservoir pressure to begin the injection, for the chemical injections there were 

included, the chemical concentration and the Pore Volume (PV) injected.  

Salinity concentrations are the parameter modifying the interfacial tension

The reservoir is initially developed without injection, so it resembles a 

common field development. After reaching an average pressure in all cells of 6000

5.6. PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATON

particle swarm optimization having as variable to maximize the NPV of each model 

by modifying the parameters mentioned previously on Table 5.5.1-2 and Table 

5.5.2-2. As for the parameters of the optimizer the selected ones are found on Table

6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

In this section the results of the laboratory, and simulation for both Cerena and Lula 

models are discussed.

6.1. SURFACTANT INPUT SELECTION 

The available surfactants (anionic, cationic and non-ionic) were characterized 

regarding their CMC adsorption in the saline medium.  

Figure 6.1-1, presents the surface tension measurements for the anionic 

surfactant in the saline medium.  It can be viewed the decreasing of the surface 

tension as the surfactant concentration increases and the intersection of these 

straight lines for the high salinity brine at 48 mg/L, which is the CMC value. The 

reference in distilled water of the CMC given by the manufacturer was 301 mg/L. 

In Figure 6.1-2, it is found the curves to find the CMC of the non-ionic 

surfactant. There was no reference for this surfactant by the manufacturer in distilled 

water. The CMC was found at brine conditions as 109 mg/L. 

Last, for the cationic surfactant, it was found a CMC of 300 mg/L in high brine 

conditions compared to 335 mg/L in distilled water given by the manufacturer. The 

lab plot obtained can be observed in Figure 6.1-3. 

The difference of CMC between brine and distilled water conditions is known 

as “salting out” and it refers of how the salts present on the water steals the water 

available for polar chain hydration from the micelles resulting on lower surfactant 

concentrations required for the micelle concentration (HUBBARD, 2002; ROSEN, 

2004). 

Although at the CMC a solution attends its largest surface tension reduction, 

a chemical EOR method requires higher volumes to compensate for possible 

consumptions and losses on the reservoir due to entrapment or adsorption. 

Therefore, any field or simulation carried out must be over CMC concentration, and 

it is preferred a low CMC value, so the additional concentration does not affect the 

economy of any project. Similar behavior is expected in their adsorption, so no 

additional concentrations are added in the reservoir to compensate.

Regarding surfactant adsorption, the cationic and anionic surfactant were 

tested as mentioned on the methodology by potentiometric titration and the non-ionic 

by comparing its surface tension behavior before and after rock powder presence. 

On Figure 6.1-4 and Figure 6.1-5 it can be found the adsorption curves for the non-

ionic and anionic surfactants, were the plateau of adsorption was 6.3 mg/g-rock and 

73.3 mg/g-rock respectively. As for the cationic surfactant its adsorption was so low 

that the delta between the surfactant before and after the presence of the rock after 

24 hours was not perceived with the potentiometric titrator, therefore its adsorption 

was lower than 0.5 mg/g-rock, for this research due to the uncertainty of this measure 

it was selected this value reference of its adsorption.  In this way, the largest 

consumption was on the anionic, followed by the nonionic and the cationic, behavior 

expected as it was mentioned in section 2.1, the surface and surfactant charges play 

a central role on the adsorption. In this case, the anionic with the negative charge 

was attracted much more by the positive surface of the carbonate generating larger 

adsorption. The opposite happened to the cationic surfactant.

From these results, it was clear that it was required a surfactant with low 

adsorption similar to the cationic and non-ionic tested on the laboratory, and low 

CMC as the behavior encountered with the anionic surfactant, Table 6.1-1. The three 

surfactants did not fulfill the requirement of low adsorption and low CMC at the same 

time, therefore searching another surfactant was required. Additionally, as 

mentioned in the methodology, it was required information of the interfacial tension 

as a salinity function for a condition like the one encountered in the pre-salt 

reservoirs. 

Therefore, for the surfactant, after reviewing the literature the modeling data 

were based on Zhang et al. (2013), using a sulfobetaine based zwitterionic surfactant 

with high salinity tolerance, expecting low interfacial tension (IFT) at salinity 

concentrations around 6% of salt content. Interfacial measurement as a function of

salinity was available at surfactant concentration ranging from 0.05% to 0.3 %, a 

concentration range useful to reduce the associated cost per kilogram of 

conventional surfactants. The interfacial tension versus total dissolved solids at 

different surfactant concentration is detailed in Figure 6.1-6. The surfactant 

adsorption on limestone was also considered, and it was defined as 0.72 mg/g-rock 

based on Zhang et al. (2013), lower than other researches (AHMADI; SHADIZADEH, 

2016), and the critical micelle concentration was included on the model as the 

minimum concentration required to observe micelle formation, 2.65x10-3 g/L.

As can be observed this surfactant fulfills the behavior detailed previously, it presents 

low adsorption with less than 1 mg/g-rock, its CMC is placed in a low range which 

makes viable its use on a commercial scale, and its behavior at high salinity brines 

present low interfacial tension (~1x10-3 mN/m). This data was the one employed as 

input for the simulation models. 

6.2. POLYMER BEHAVIOR

As discussed previously, a solution with a higher viscosity than oil was 

needed, &gt;20 cP at 20°C. Therefore, polymer solutions with concentrations under 

1000 ppm did not fit the requirement, so were not used preliminary (0, 500 ppm). 

The 1000 ppm line even when at some points w close to the oil viscosity and at very 

low revolutions is higher, it is discarded because these velocities are not 

representative of wellbore conditions, and aggressive conditions will bring 

uncertainties of the possible behavior of the polymer (mechanical degradation). So, 

the other two options are 2000 ppm and 3000 ppm, however, even when both go 

over the condition established, the former concentration in a preliminary screening 

is the option selected. The main reason is, that higher polymer concentrations 

represent higher costs for an EOR method, moreover, a solution with a viscosity 

higher than the expected can represent higher injection pressures at wellbore 

conditions. 

It must be stated the viscosity behavior of the polymer was an input for the 

simulation phase, so a more precise polymer concentration is obtained under the 

optimization step. The tables with the laboratory measurements, n and K parameters 

are in the Appendix C.

6.3. LULA INVERTED FIVE-SPOT MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS 

The main results for the inverted five-spot model, based on the Lula field case 

study, are detailed in the next sections. 

6.3.1. Comparison between IOR methods – Economic Scenarios 

In Table 6.3.1-1 shows the results obtained for the optimization of WF, PF, 

and SP. It can be noticed that despite the polymer injection reduced the volume of 

injected and produced water, and kept the oil produced, the higher cost associated 

to the polymer injection reduced the NPV of the field exploitation program. As for the 

SP, the simultaneous injection of polymer and surfactant did increase the oil 

produced and the recovery factor, while at the same time the water production and 

water injection volumes were higher than the WF values, resulting in higher 

expenditures on treatment and chemical injection. Such behavior summed up to a 

longer production time of the model, it is reflected on a lower NPV when compared 

with the water injection. This behavior was observed in all three models and 

economic scenarios.

Moreover, it can be concluded that higher oil prices tend to favor the use of 

chemicals when observing that the exploitation period of the Probable and 

Pessimistic scenario were shorter than the Optimistic Scenario with higher oil prices. 

In years for the SP, 23&gt;21&gt;18 years and for the PF, 20&gt;21&gt;18 years, optimistic, 

probable, and pessimistic respectively.  

For all three economic scenarios, both chemical programs proved to be not 

profitable even after the optimization performed. Although both presented a positive 

end revenue on the optimistic and probable scenarios, the chemical cost impacted 

the production program severally in the long run (15.3 MMUSD of chemical facilities 

cost at year one). However, it was proved that the PF brings lower volumes of 

produced water and requires lower volumes of water injected. As for the SP program, 

it increases the oil recovery factor by allowing longer production periods, but the cost 

of having longer production periods and chemical cost kept the NPV on all three 

scenarios at the same value of the PF, and lower than the WF. 



64 
 

 
 

On the other hand, it can be stated that the SP was technically speaking a 

success as it brought an incremental recovery ranging 5.5% to 10.3% when 

comparing against the WF. Proving that not all technical projects are economically 

viable, as in this case, the incremental was not enough to cover the chemical 

expenditure of injecting simultaneously surfactant, polymer and the facilities 

investment required for this procedure. Also, in all the six cases the final water cut 

was the same or lower than the ones found on the WF and PF, with longer production 

times, stating that the mix of surfactant and polymer at least brings the same benefits 

as the polymer flooding by itself. 

6.3.2. Comparison of EOR methods - Geological models  

For this analysis, the optimized injection programs with an oil price of 

50USD/bbl were the cases taken to evaluate how the three models differ from each 

other for both the polymer flooding and the surfactant-polymer flooding. 

In the literature can be found that a higher permeability is often desired on 

almost all screening criteria as described by Sheng et al. (2015) because low 

permeability zones often present smaller transmissibility areas where the large 

polymer molecules may fail to flow.  

In Figure 6.3.2-1 are represented the water cut curves for all the three models 

for the PF and SP injection. The uniform injection front on the reservoir results on 

more instantaneous water cut increment of all production wells, which is reflected on 

close to vertical slopes. As for the SP, the behavior is very similar; however, the 

water cut reaches its maximum much slower than for PF, allowing for longer 

production times and therefore higher recoveries. This can be also observed in 

Figure 6.3.2-2 where the SP last for a longer period reaching higher recoveries than 

the other two methodologies.

chemicals flooding at the probable economic scenario.

In Figure 6.3.2-2, it can be observed that with higher values of permeability, 

even when it is not a norm, higher recovery factor, therefore, larger produced 

volumes. On the other hand, the model with less recovery was the one with 200mD. 

WF and PF shut-in at earlier times in all three models which ratified the improvement 

in the oil sweep and incremental oil of the SP technique.

In Table 6.3.2-1, it can be noticed that the final results of the optimization did 

not lead to an apparent relation about heterogeneity and polymer consumption, nor 



66 
 

 
 

because it is inexistent but because the optimization followed the tendency to reduce 

to a minimum the chemical concentration and pore volumes injected.

As for the SP, on Table 6.3.2-2 can be observed that like PF, the optimization 

tended to the minimum injection of surfactant, as it is the highest cost material. But 

in this case, the tendency to have higher cost can be observed in the low permeability 

case, which requires larger PV injected to bring similar recoveries as to the other two 

models in any of their scenarios. Concluding that low permeability reservoirs 

required larger quantities of chemical injection and may be not the best option for a 

CEOR injection.

6.3.3. Parameters optimization 

All the field development programs: water, polymer, and surfactant-polymer 

floodings were optimized for all economic and geological scenarios. This way, a 

balanced comparison could be performed between the EOR methodologies. Next, 

the key behaviors regarding the parameters being optimized for the PF and SP are 

discussed.  

6.3.3.1. Polymer flooding parameters 

In Table 6.3.3.1-1, it can be found the optimized parameters for all geological 

models and all the three economic scenarios.  It can be observed that despite the 

difference of permeability, all three models in all three economic scenarios had the 

smallest polymer concentration possible for this research. The main reason is the 

high cost associated to the chemical injection, which the optimizer reduces to 

improve the NPV. In other words, there was an inverse correlation between chemical 

concentration and NPV. This analogy can be observed in Figure 6.3.3.1-1, as the 

polymer concentration was reduced the NPV increases even going from losses to 

bring some profit until a plateau is reached and no further reduction alters the NPV. 

The situation was accrued due to the economic parameters fixed for the pessimistic 

scenario. Thus, the optimization model brought as optimal, the cases where a 

minimum of the polymer was injected, with all NPVs were negative. 



68 
 

 
 

As for the optimistic model, it can be highlighted that the NPV delta in the 

optimistic model was much less than in the other two economic scenarios, showing 

that higher oil prices increase the viability of using chemical EOR programs.

Based on Table 6.3.3.1-1, it can be noticed that with higher average 

permeability, the higher NPV and RF are. This statement was backed up if it is 

remembered Darcy’s equation, in which there is a direct correlation between 

permeability and the oil rate, meaning that the higher permeability model is the one 

which brings higher recoveries. Based on Table 6.3.3.1-1, and relating to the 

Probable scenario analysis, it can be said that with higher average permeability, the 

higher the NPV. 

Moreover, based on  Table 6.3.3.1-1, the average water cut to shut in the well 

increased as the oil price did, 94.0% &gt; 96.7% &gt; 97.1% in order of 40USD, 50 USD 

and 70USD respectively. Therefore as the oil price increases, the water treatment is 

compensated, allowing longer periods of production and higher cost due to large 

water-oil ratios of fluid production. However, each well behaved differently for every 

geological model, so fixing one or all well to the same water cut shut in will not bring 



69 
 

 
 

profits without an adequate selection. It can be seen in Figure 6.3.3.1-3 and Figure 

6.3.3.1-4 examples of this behavior.

On the contrary, the minimum average pressure on the reservoir at which the 

injection well should be opened follows an opposite tendency, so a lower pressure 

means more time producing under no injection with the own reservoir energy. In 

Figure 6.3.3.1-2, it can be observed that the optimum moment to start the injection 

is in a range close to 6000 to 7000 psi. As for the minimum average pressure in the 

reservoir at which the injector should be opened follows the same tendency as the 

probable economic scenario, lower pressure means more time producing under no 

injection with the own reservoir energy

As for the Pore volume injected, in all three economic scenarios the tendency 

was to reduce it, explained as to reduce the quantity and therefore the associated 

cost of the chemicals, the median value of all the simulation runs per model is 15% 

to 16% of PV injected disregarding the economic scenario, Figure 6.3.3.1-5.

6.3.3.2. Surfactant-polymer flooding parameters 

In Table 6.3.3.2-1 can be found the optimized parameters for the surfactant-

polymer flooding for all three modes and economic scenarios.  

Regarding the production wells, it can be seen in Figure 6.3.3.2-1 and  Table 

6.3.3.2-1 that each well behaves differently in each model, as was discussed 

previously for the Polymer flooding cases. Arriving at the same conclusion that fixing 

one or all wells to the same shut-in water cut will not bring profits without an adequate 

selection.

producer. 

 

Source: Author, 2019 

However, in Figure 6.3.3.2-1 can be evaluated that as the oil price increases 

the water cut to shut in any of the wells increases, from 93% on the low model and 

96% on the high model. Now, talking individually from each producer, the only two 

wells with this tendency are number 2 and 4, as their distribution moves according 

to the price and the median of it. This behavior reflects how at higher oil prices wells, 



73 
 

 
 

they have larger final ultimate recoveries because water processing costs can be 

compensated by the oil sells, confirmed with the values on Table 6.3.3.2-1 where 

the shut-in water cuts are lower for the pessimistic scenario and larger for the 

optimistic scenario, on average only for the optimized results 96.9%&gt;94.7%&gt;92.2% 

for the optimistic, probable and optimistic scenario.

Another tendency that can be observed is that the low permeability model in 

all cases had the larger pore volumes injected, indicating higher volumes of the 

chemical slug are required to achieve higher oil recoveries as the permeability is 

lowered. 

As for polymer concentration, it was observed a similar behavior as the found 

for the polymer flooding, the optimal value went to the lower range, because of the 

high cost associated to the polymer powder, therefore, a small amount of the 



74 
 

 
 

chemical gives better NPV as it is reduced. This analogy can be observed in Figure 

6.3.3.2-2, as the polymer concentration is reduced the NPV increases even going 

from losses to bring some profit until a plateau is reached and no further reduction 

alters the NPV in a  range of 800 to 500 ppm. This range matched with the one in 

the Table 6.3.3.2-1 that had values slightly over 700ppm. This points to the idea that 

the parameters controlling the NPV of the project where the polymer concentration 

and the size of chemical batch injected.

polymer flooding for all three geological and a probable economic scenario.

Based on Table 6.3.3.2-1, it can be noticed that higher average permeability 

and oil prices result in higher recovery factors. However, it also proves that higher 

recoveries not always do bring larger NPVs, as for this the reduction was 34.6% on 

average when comparing against the waterflooding. Also, the water cut to shut the 

wells tends to be over 94% in 9 of 12 times. However, the average water cut to shut 

in producers in the High model, is of 91.1%, less than the average of the other two 

models, 96.4%. Closing earlier the wells can be the cause of why it is presenting 

similar NPV that the Base case, something irregular when comparing the 

optimization results of the other economic scenarios and injection programs where 

the High permeability model is always the one with the best Cash flow. This scenario 



75 
 

 
 

presented a local minimum in the water cut parameters, therefore not followed the 

behavior expected. 

Regarding the surfactant percentage, it was observed in Figure 6.3.3.2-3 that the 

tendency followed by both chemicals is the same, to reduce their associated costs. 

However, the interfacial tension reduction was kept as can be observed in  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.3.3.2-4 where at the beginning, a front of low interfacial tension is formed 

(microemulsion), and it moves across all the model until reaching the producers, 

which has an effect of increasing the oil recovered while moving at the same time 

original water saturation. This movement of oil and formation brine is what 

increments the water produced when compared against the polymer flooding results 

on section 6.3.1.

On the contrary, the minimum average pressure on the reservoir at which the 

injection well should be opened follows an opposite tendency, so a lower pressure 

means more time producing under no injection with the own reservoir energy. From 

Figure 6.3.3.2-5, it can be observed that the optimum moment to start the injection 

is in a range close to 6100 to 7000 psi, with an average of 6380 psi (Table 6.3.3.2-1 

Optimized parameters for Surfactant-polymer flooding per model and economic 

scenario.Table 6.3.3.2-1), values over the bubble point pressure where the injection 

presents higher efficiency as does not have to fill a gas layer.

On Figure 6.3.3.2-6 can be observed the box plots for each economic 

scenario and model for the salinity content of the chemical batch, where the 

tendency of the salt concentration of the brine carrying the surfactant was to go lower 

than the optimal value (60000ppm). Indicating the preference of a negative gradient 

injection program, based on the salinity content.

Moreover, Table 6.3.3.2-1, are found the optimized parameters for the 

optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Where similar to the probable scenario, the 

higher the permeability the higher the NPV. Another tendency that can be observed 

is that the low permeability model in all cases had the larger pore volumes injected, 



78 
 

 
 

indicating higher volumes of the chemical slug are required to achieve higher oil 

recoveries as the permeability is lowered, specifically higher quantities of surfactant. 

Taking into a count the optimal values of table Table 6.3.3.2-1, it can be 

observed that a negative gradient of salt injection is being followed, the first batch in 

8 of the 9 cases had salt content under its optimal value of 60000 ppm, while the 

water injection which followed the chemical batch presented in 5 of 9 cases under 

optimal conditions too. This behavior is explained as in reservoir conditions the salt 

content of the formation brine is much higher than the optimal value; therefore the 

injection scheme must take into account the creation of a salinity mix between 

formation and injection waters (HIRASAKI; MILLER; PUERTO, 2011).  

6.3.4. Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Lula 

The Expected Monetary Value for the waterflooding, polymer flooding and 

Surfactant-polymer flooding including the NPV of all three economic scenarios and 

all three heterogeneous models were 69.9  MMUSD, 58.8 MMUSD, and 49.2 

MMUSD respectively (Table 6.3.4-1, Table 6.3.4-2 and Table 6.3.4-3). Therefore, 

with a difference of 16% and 30%, the water flooding it’s the best injection program 

for the inverted five-spot model representing the Lula Field properties. The largest 

difference of 26% and 40% against PF and SP respectively is encountered on the 

low permeability model corresponding to a reservoir with 200mD as average 

permeability. Finding that matches with the common criteria that low permeability 

reservoirs are less preferable for chemical EOR projects that employ polymer as 

viscosifying agent (TABER; MARTIN; SERIGHT, 1997b; DICKSON; LEAHY-DIOS; 

WYLIE, 2010; AL ADASANI; BAI, 2011).

Lula model. 

 

Source: Author, 2019 

Evaluating the risk curve in Figure 6.3.4-1, there is a 45% chance of any of 

the projects being a failure under an economic evaluation. Moreover, the gap 

between technologies goes wider on negative NPVs which proves that at low oil 

prices the CEOR methods are not a possible selection even when higher oil RF are 

obtained, but they depressed even further the value of the project against WF. 

6.4. CERENA I INVERTED FIVE SPOT MODEL SIMULATION RESULTS 

The results for the IFS Cerena I model are detailed in the next sections. 

6.4.1. Comparison between IOR methods - Economic Scenarios 

 

In Table 6.4.1-1 shows the results obtained for the optimization of the IOR 

projects. It can be noticed that both polymer flooding and surfactant-polymer 

floodings reduced the volume of water produced and gave an incremental on oil 

produced while maintaining an incremental of NPV in the project’s life. The behavior 

of both chemical injections was similar, final water cut of the filed, oil recovery factor 

and total oil produced were not significantly different. Both programs, by slowing the

increment of the water phase (water cut) during the project’s life, resulted in a 

reduction of the water treatment costs compensating the chemical investments. The 

similarity in their results pointed out that the surfactant was not playing a key role in 

the behavior of the SP flooding, despite it increased the oil recovery.  

It can be observed a similar tendency as the one was presented in the 

previous discussion for the Lula project. Both chemical injections recovered more oil 

while reducing water treatment costs and injection costs, impacting therefore not 

only the technical performance of the field but also the economical. it was observed 

that in all economic scenarios both chemical methods brought higher profits than 

WF. Moreover, the chemical cost was compensated due to the reduction of water 

injection and production, both characteristics of a polymer injection. Another fact that 

must be pointed when comparing PF and SP it’s that the individual polymer cost of 

the PF in 6 of 9 the cases is less than the surfactant plus polymer costs of the SP, 

but the NPV of the SP cases are higher, as the main factor improving it were the 

reduction of water injected and the water produced plus the additional recovery. 

Also, the consumption of polymer is less in 8 of 9 the cases for the SP than the PF, 

meaning that the synergy between both chemicals reduced the amount required of 

polymer in a Chemical EOR program. This phenomenon happened when the 

surfactant reduced the interfacial tension between the phases and improves the 

mobility of the fluid injected by altering the relative permeability curves.

Additionally, it must be noticed that for the low permeability model, the 

cumulative water injection tended in almost all cases and IOR projects to be reduced 

when compared with the other models, as the injection goes affected negatively by 

the polymer viscosity. Therefore, higher permeability rocks can be better objectives 

for a polymer-based program, either by itself or with other chemicals as a surfactant 

or an alkaline matching the same conclusion of the Lula model and what different 

authors in their screening criteria have mentioned  (TABER; MARTIN; SERIGHT, 

1997b; DICKSON; LEAHY-DIOS; WYLIE, 2010; AL ADASANI; BAI, 2011). 

6.4.2. Comparison of IOR methods - geological models 

Because low permeability zones often present smaller pore throats that may 

be plugged by the polymer molecules and injectivity problems due to the high 

viscosity of the fluid injected, reservoirs too tight are not common in the literature.

In Figure 6.4.2-1 are represented the water cut curves for all the three models 

and all three injections. As can be observed, the water cut behavior of the three 

models for the WF differed significantly from the chemical floodings, reaching higher 

points at similar production periods; moreover the rate at how the slope grew was 

higher for the water injection in all three models, a behavior expected when 

channeling and faster breakthrough happens. The breakthrough for all three models 

occurs between 2028 to 2032 in the WF, see Figure 6.4.2-2.  

In Figure 6.4.2-2 can be confirmed that low permeability models were not the 

preferred medium for a polymer-based injection program, as the oil production rates 

behaves in the same way as for the water injection, the water cut increased and the 

chemical addition did not generate any reduction. Also, in Figure 6.4.2-2, it can be 

observed that with higher values of permeability, even when it is not a norm, higher 

production rates, therefore, larger produced volumes. 

Moreover, in the same Figure 6.4.2-2, can be observed a fall in the water rate 

for all the three models for the PF and SP, being more drastically in the low and base 

permeability models. This behavior is explained by the viscosifying action of the 

polymer which reduces the channeling of the water injected and reduced the water 

production of the more aqueous zones.

As shown on models Table 6.4.2-1 and Source: Author, 2019, the pore 

volume injected is less than planned by the optimizer, as it will be mentioned in the 

6.4.3 section. However, these volumes were still in the range of historical field test 

applications, based on Farouq and Thomas review (1992), which mentioned in their 

research a range of 0.025 to 0.4 PV. On the other hand, there was a tendency to 

require less chemical injected as the permeability model was smaller, the average 

polymer required per model was 1630&lt;3330&lt;5930 tons for the polymer flooding from 

low&lt;base&lt;high permeability models; the same behavior was encountered on the SP 

flooding. As it was reduced the chemical injected, therefore, the chemical cost 

followed the same behavior (Table 6.4.2-1 and Table 6.4.2-2).

6.4.3. Parameters optimization 

All the field development programs: water, polymer, and surfactant-polymer 

floodings were optimized for all economic and geological scenarios. This way a 

balanced comparison could be performed between the IOR methodologies. Next, it 

is discussed how the parameters behaved on the chemical injections. 

For the Inverted five spot based on the Cerena I reservoir, the parameters in 

Table 6.4.3-1 won’t be deeply analyzed on this research despite that at the 

beginning were selected, mainly because these parameters presented behaviors not 

expected and not conclusive, requiring therefore further studies.

IOR methods.

The first two variables on Table 6.4.3-1, minimum BHP and max fluid rate for 

each producer well, followed the same tendencies for all economic scenarios and 

reservoir models: maximizing the fluid rate an minimizing the bottom hole pressure. 

Both parameters are interdepended and were evaluated simultaneously as having 

the same issues. First, as the production platform cost on this economic evaluation 

was fixed and it did not vary depending on the fluid production of the wells, the 

optimizer maximizes the fluid rate without having an economic parameter that 

controlled its performance directly. Second, the model did not contemplate the 

existence of flow efficiency phenomena that affect the wells such as skin or formation 

damage, therefore the well followed a simplified “Productivity Index” behavior, 

defined as “the volume delivered per psi of drawdown at the sand face (BPD/psi)” 

(SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED, 2018) meaning that theoretically the maximum oil 

production was achieved at the largest drawdown or 0 psi of flowing pressure. For 

this research, the parameters always tended to the minimum bottom hole pressure 

of 20000 kPa and the maximum production rate of 6359.5 m3/day.  

Both tendencies can be found in Figure 6.4.3-1 and Figure 6.4.3-2 whereas 

mentioned the fluid rate tends to maximize and the bottom hole pressure to minimize 

following an ideal behavior.

Regarding the other three parameters: polymer/salt concentration in the 

chase slug and pore volume injected, the displacing slug was not injected in any of 

the Cerena models, because the pore volume injected of the main slug never 

achieved the minimum value to start the second one. All the injections ended in less 

than 0.1 PV after reaching the simulation limit of 30 years.  

For the PF and SP the injection rates were lower than the expected, less than ten 

time the water, due to the low injectivity of the formation, low permeability layers 

below 100 mD, and high viscosity of the fluid injected, both can be observed in 



88 
 

 
 

Figure 6.4.3-4 and Figure 6.4.3-5. The injection rate was low for the SP despite the 

pressure at the bottom of the hole is at its maximum, the same set as for the WF, 

see Figure 6.4.3-3. 

Moreover in Figure 6.4.3-4, it can be noticed that the solution viscosity is higher 

around the injector at the end of the simulation reaching values up to 70 cp (the 

polymer starts to disperse and it losses the viscosity after this front) and in part “B” 

of the same figure, it can be noticed that the interfacial tension was reduced and it 

affected a large area of the sector. However, it is requiring longer PVs injected as to 

observe a bigger effect on the incremental oil recovery than the one presented in all 

the models.

Also, the profile of injection despite not moving in a large area, observed an 

uniform vertical displacement, which has been reported in the literature for polymer 

injection  (SHENG, 2011; SHENG; LEONHARDT; AZRI, 2015). 

6.4.3.1. Polymer flooding parameters 

In Table 6.4.3-1, it can be found the optimized parameters for all geological 

models and three economic scenarios. Regarding the polymer concentration, the 

optimal values were in the middle region of the range given to the optimizer. What 

matches with the section 6.4.3 analysis of the low injection rate, in this case the 

polymer concentration went up as to reduce the volume injected while still displacing

the oil. There was no tendency as to have lower or larger concentrations depending 

on the model, however, on Figure 6.4.3.1-1 can be noticed that for all three models 

the range went between 1000 to 2000 ppm, where the optimal values fell. The 

chemical cost was paid by the incremental oil of the PF strategy, different from the 

observed in the Lula’s model were all the values went to the low range close to 500 

ppm.

Based on Table 6.4.3-1, it can be noticed that with higher average 

permeability, the higher its NPV and RF, explained by Darcy’s equation, where a 

larger permeability means higher fluid rates that resulted in the NPV and incremental 

RF observed. Also, the water cut to shut the wells varies between the models, having 

higher final water cuts for the High model: if a final water cut is selected for all wells, 

in average it would be 81.15%&lt;81.33%&lt;86.38% for the low, base, and high models 

respectively.

About the minimum average pressure on the reservoir at which the injection 

well should be opened has three ranges, one for each reservoir model, resulting in 

a range of 40000 to 50000 kPa, therefore it is a variable that must be evaluated for 

each case as it depends on every set of variables per model (Figure 6.4.3.1-2).

injection on the NPV for each geological model in the probable economic scenario. 

 

Source: Author, 2019 

if needed operatively, the water cut to shut in the wells could be selected close 

to 83% - 84%, Figure 6.4.3.1-3 and Figure 6.4.3.1-4, meaning that for any economic 

scenario and model this parameter could be fixed for all the well group in this range. 

However, as recommended for Lula’s model, it is a parameter that should be 



92 
 

 
 

evaluated per well and operational conditions as it presented dispersion of the data 

from 93% to 76%.  

Regarding the reservoir pressure to start the injection, all three models differ 

individually between economic scenarios, shown in Figure 6.4.3.1-2, Figure 

6.4.3.1-7 and Figure 6.4.3.1-8. The base model, probable and pessimistic tend to 

have a pressure lower than 45000 kPa; for the high model optimistic and probable 

tend to 40000 kPa, and the low model it’s the one that has a tendency in all three 

economic scenarios to start the injection as earlier as possible over 45000 kPa. The 

last behavior can be explained, when evaluating that this model it’s the one with 

larger problems of injectivity due to its overall lower permeability, therefore it requires 

to start earlier the injection as to compensate during the 30 years program the 

chemical investment.  

The tendencies of the probable and pessimistic scenarios were similar and 

differ from the optimistic. Which lead to the idea that with better economic scenarios 

(higher oil prices) could be best to let the reservoir deplete by their own energy 

longer, therefore less investment, and later incorporate more reserves with IOR 

programs.

6.4.3.2. Surfactant-Polymer flooding parameters 

In Table 6.4.3.2-1, it can be found the optimized parameters for all geological 

models for the probable economic scenario of the Surfactant-Polymer flooding. It 

can be observed oil RF, and the NPV increased as the permeability of the model did, 

while at the same time the incremental recovery when compared against the WF.

Based on Table 6.4.3.2-1, it was noticed that the polymer concentration 

presented one tendency to go on to the higher concentrations range from 1500ppm 

to 3000ppm, as happened with the PF. Explained the same way as for the PF, 

increasing the injected fluid viscosity reduced the fluid volume in the higher 

permeability layers which lower the injected fluid cost and treatment as it worked as 

a conformance corrector.  

While the surfactant concentration was affected for the economic scenario, 

the lower price presented lower quantities, and the optimistic economic scenario 

allowed the upper concentrations. Similar to the observed in the Lula’s simulations, 

the oil price affects the economy of the CEOR projects, but in this case as the Cerena 

models were able to compensate the cost, higher quantities were injected. However 

the tendency was not clear between models as observed in Figure 6.4.3.2-3, the 

base model tend to be on the lower range between 0.2 to 0.05 %, the high model 

tends to be on the upper side between 0.35 and 0.5%, while the low model does not 

have a range as its concentration moves between all the range defined for the 

optimization, 0.05% to 0.5%. 

The salt concentration based one more time in Figure 6.4.3.2-3, had a 

tendency to be injected in lower concentrations (under 60000 ppm) for the low and 

high model, while the base goes in all the range optimized. Leading to the idea that 

the salt it’s a parameter with interaction effects as its tendency was not marked 

between models. Moreover, the low model tended to have local extrema issues on 

this variable as in this graph the points stay in a straight line the same in all the 

range; therefore it was not conclusive and led to question the result for the surfactant 

concentration as it depended significantly on the salt content.   

Focusing on the average reservoir pressure to start the injection, almost in all 

the scenarios the optimal value was the lowest reservoir pressure constraint, 4000 

psi. This strategy reduces the quantity of chemical injected and then reduces the 

costs in the long run of the project, Figure 6.4.3.2-4.

Regarding the water cut to shut in the wells, when observing the optimized 

parameters in Table 6.4.3.2-1, the idea of early closing the wells was supported as 

8 of the 12 water cuts is lower than 75%. However, in Figure 6.4.3.2-5 the 

tendencies can be divided, the wells 3 and 4 benefited of earlier closures while the 

producers 1 and 2 tended to be on a larger range; therefore, they must be evaluated 

individually and their interactions with polymer and surfactant concentration.

The surfactant and salt concentrations were clearer on the optimistic and 

pessimistic scenarios than for the probable. In Figure 6.4.3.2-6 and Figure 

6.4.3.2-7, it can be observed that higher surfactant concentrations were injected with 

brines with lower salt content, and the opposite applies. As mentioned in the Lula 

case, the preferable injection of salt according to the literature is a gradient injection 

which makes a contrast with the high salinity encountered in the reservoir. In Figure 

6.4.3.2-7 the high salinity brine with low surfactant concentration indicated that on 

the pessimist scenario the surfactant was not the main chemical agent, but the 

polymer was, as with higher salt concentrations the reduction of interfacial was not 

optimal (close to 60000 ppm). A reduction of surfactant cost was encountered, 

therefore on the pessimistic scenario. 

Salt concentration per model can also be observed in Figure 6.4.3.2-8, where 

the average was found disregarding the economic scenario. Being on this graph 

where the tendency was clearer, the salt concentration was close to the optimal 

value mentioned on the input section and lab results of 60000 ppm NaCl (HIRASAKI; 

MILLER; PUERTO, 2011), where the IFT was minimal for all surfactant 

concentrations.

this time as a function of the economic scenario.  The surfactant concentration 

depends on the economics of the project, and the higher concentrations were 

encountered in the optimistic scenario and the minimum percentages on the 

contrary, in the more pessimistic scenario. This can be confirmed as the average of 

the optimal surfactant concentration for the pessimistic scenario is 0.05%, for the 

probable scenario 0.16% and for the optimistic 0.32%. As mentioned before, at 



101 
 

 
 

higher oil prices, the economy of CEOR projects can compensate their costs and 

therefore higher concentrations on the brine injected.

Finally, it must be noticed that despite the low injectivity of this chemical 

solution, there was sweep and effect of the surfactant addition in the models. In 

Figure 6.4.3.2-10, the (a) section cut shows the fraction of the surfactant that had 

been adsorbed in the layer observed for the low model, which was in average 1% 

while the (b) section cut shows the same layer for the high model, with an average 

of adsorption of 10%. First, it should be pointed out that higher permeability 

reservoirs do increase the oil recoveries and bring higher fluid rates, they require 

larger volumes of chemical injected to compensate the adsorption. With this results, 



102 
 

 
 

it can be discarded losses of surfactant as an issue on the performance of the 

technique inside of the reservoir, additionally, the area that covered went from the 

center to the producers indicating a good movement of the surfactant through the 

reservoir especially in the direction of producers 1 and 2. This movement indicated 

that in this wells, if a surface facility was built, they will be the first requiring 

microemulsion treatments because of the arrival of the emulsion front (LEVITT et al., 

2013). Moreover, the incremental oil volumes given by the SP when compared to 

the PF were related to this IFT reduction.

6.4.4. Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Cerena I 

In Table 6.4.4-1, Table 6.4.4-2 and Table 6.4.4-3 have the EVM for each 

injection program according to the probability assigned for each case. As can be 

observed, the EMV for SP flooding was the higher of all three, followed by the PF.  

In Figure 6.4.4-1, the optimized results for both chemical injections are 

shown, relating: cumulative oil production, final water cut, recovery factor, economic 



103 
 

 
 

model and NPV. It can be observed that the best economic results are obtained on 

the models where the final water cut after the 30 years of all the field production are 

between 50% and 65%, showing that optimizing the wells shut-in by its water cut 

can benefit the cash flow of a chemical recovery project. Moreover, the PF and the 

SP can increase the cumulative oil production overall models and scenarios, 

especially on a low barrel price scenario, when comparing against the WF. It can be 

noted that the NPV difference between methods gets higher on optimistic scenarios, 

meaning that higher oil prices benefit the implementation of chemical EOR programs 

such as PF and SP.

6.5. MODEL RESULTS VERSUS CARBONATE FIELD APPLICATION 

REPORTS 

The results of this research for the Cerena-I model can be compared to 

findings of real field applications (the Lula model had an EMV lower for SP and PF 

than WF, therefore, is not compared). The most recent report of SP injection was the 

Single Well Tracer Test of an offshore carbonate reservoir in Abu Dhabi (AL-AMRIE 

et al., 2015). Both, their research and the present agreed on: salinity brine for the 

chemical injection lower than the one encountered at reservoir conditions it is 

preferential. Six of nine of the optimal scenarios on this research showed a salinity 

concentration under 70000 ppm (Table 6.5-1), less than formation water, 104361 

ppm (HIRASAKI; MILLER; PUERTO, 2011). Additionally, the objective reservoir 



105 
 

 
 

layers despite having a positive response on incremental recovery, the polymer 

solution presented injectivity problems reducing the injection rate to less than10% of 

its initial conditions with water. This flow resistance behavior has been observed in 

the Shengli pilot (ZHENQUAN et al., 2013) and other simulation reports (DANG et 

al., 2015). 

However, the incremental oil recovery factor of the SP flooding despite being 

positive when compared to a conventional water injection, from 0.1 to 9.5%, the field 

results of some pilots are even higher, as an example the pilot performed on the 

Shengli field gave an incremental of 16.7% (ZHENQUAN et al., 2013) and the pilot 

on the Minas field (BOU-MIKAEL et al., 2000), an incremental of 20% — proving that 

field results can differ on from simulation results.

Regarding the performance of the PF, if compared against some field cases, 

it can be seen in Figure 6.5-1 that this research result falls in a range of medium 

performance, having a low quantity of polymer injected and low and medium 

incremental recoveries compared with real field data (SHENG; LEONHARDT; AZRI, 

2015). Better performance than the ones obtained for the Lula model explained as 

the oil encountered on it has higher API gravity resulting in less dense fluid with lower 

viscosities, a condition not favorable for the polymer flooding (NEEDHAM; DOE, 

1987).

Regarding the performance of the SP, as was mentioned previously the PV 

injected was less than expected due to the low injectivity of the well. Additionally, it 

was desired to compare how the CEOR methodology performed against other 

projects. In Figure 6.5-2, it can be observed that the performance of the SP is far 

from being what would be expected as the incremental recoveries are not that high 

and the Surfactant quantity is less than some results of field applications. However, 

the results tend to increase rapidly with low quantities of surfactant, having a 

similarity to the laboratory results. This tendency indicates that by solving the 

injectivity issues and larger volumes of surfactant injected, a significant incremental 

oil could be recovered (DEBONS; BRAUN; LEDOUX, 2004). 

Moreover, when comparing the results with the one obtained of Lula it can be 

mentioned that despite higher PV injected the incremental recovery is more or less 

the same, indicating that the Cerena cases may increase even higher the oil 

recovered and therefore the NPV if a solution for the low injectivity is defined.

CONCLUSIONS 

Regarding the laboratory evaluation: 

? Surfactants with low CMC, IFT, and adsorption are required for carbonate rocks, 

the type of surfactant; therefore, it is different than the anionic surfactants 

employed in sandstones. Non-ionic, cationic, or zwitterionic surfactants can be 

an answer to this requirement. 

? The Xanthan gum behaves as expected on high salinity brines, generating a 

broad range of viscosities depending on its concentration.  

Regarding the simulation evaluation of both models, Lula and Cerena-I:  

? The economic cost of the chemical injection reduced the NPV of all scenarios in 

the Lula IFS, despite increasing the oil recovery factor. Therefore, the associated 

costs of CEOR program play a fundamental role in its applicability, a behavior 

observed previously by Bahrami et al. (2016) and Kamari et al. (2016) 

researches. 

? Surfactant-Polymer flooding is the oil recovery mechanism which provided the in 

all the cases the largest incremental recovery for both models.  

? When to close a producer well for a Chemical EOR program varies between 

economic scenario and models; however there is a tendency: the higher the oil 

price is, the higher the water cut shut-in can be as higher oil prices allow larger 

times producing per well. 

? When to start a CEOR injection must be evaluated for each case. However, the 

Lula Model presents a tendency to start the project as early as possible, a 

statement previously visualized by Sheng (2011). In his research is observed that 

the main reason as to delay a CEOR injection based on the polymer is the 

economy of the project and the knowledge a company has over its reservoir. 



109 
 

 
 

? Average permeability over 100 md is the best option to inject polymer according 

to this results, which Dickson et al. (2010) in his screening recommendation 

highlights is the best option for this type of CEOR programs. 

? The brine salinity required for a surfactant injection must be at/under the optimal 

concentration (~60000 ppm). Also, a negative gradient is the best 

recommendation, a behavior, and recommendation previously done by Hirasaki; 

Miller and Puerto (2011). This behavior is explained as in reservoir conditions the 

salt content of the formation brine is much higher than the optimal value; 

therefore the injection scheme must take into account the salinity mix between 

formation and injection waters, a mixture which reaches concentrations close to 

the optimal. 

? During PF and SP flooding it is possible to observe problems related to injectivity 

of the solution on low permeability reservoirs, due to the high viscosity of the 

polymer. This was observed previously in a field pilot on a carbonate reservoir 

(AL-AMRIE et al., 2015) and previously in a laboratory level (SERIGHT; 

SEHEULT; TALASHEK, 2009). 

? The associated treatment and chemical costs of a CEOR project impact its 

profitability under any economic scenario. It requires then an implementation that 

targets not only the incremental recovery of oil but also the overall cash flow of 

the project (SHENG, 2011).   

? The risk curve graphs showed that WF, PF, and SP are close in space. 

Optimizing either one methodology and associated costs will increase the gap 

between them. 

? For the Cerena-I models: the SP programs do increase the NPV and EMV when 

compared to the PF however, the increment is not significant either in profitability 

or recovery factor (comparing between both CEOR methodologies). This can be 

explained as an effect of low quantities of chemical injected due to injectivity 

problem in the injector. Assumption confirmed when evaluating its performance 



110 
 

 
 

against a pool of data relating surfactant quantities versus incremental recoveries 

and field results. Despite this result, it can be then expected on the other side 

that if the models have larger volumes injected the recovery factor and its cash 

flow may increase, as there was an incremental recovery with very low volumes 

of chemical. 

? The Cerena-I sector presented injectivity problems when the chemical slug was 

injected regardless of the permeability model, as a result of high pressures and 

high viscosity fluid. It must be studied possible solutions to this phenomenon as 

it makes difficult achieving the quantity of surfactant required to have large 

increments of oil recovery by IFT reduction. One possibility not evaluated in this 

research it’s changing the position of the vertical well or replacing it for a 

directional well avoiding the zones with lower injectivity. 

? For the Cerena-I model: the surfactant concentration depends on the economics 

of the project, the higher concentrations are encountered on the optimistic 

scenarios, and the minimum percentages are on the contrary on the more 

pessimistic scenarios. This can be confirmed as the average of the optimal 

surfactant concentration for the pessimistic scenario is 0.05%, for the probable 

scenario 0.16% and for the optimistic 0.32%. 

FUTURE WORKS 

Next, a list of ideas for future works based on this research: 

? Evaluate the performance of both CEOR methodologies in a real field model. 

? Evaluate the performance of both CEOR injections in coreflooding tests and 

preliminary evaluation and screening of chemical based on state of the art. 

? Evaluate the performance of other simulation alternatives such as proxy analysis, 

neural networks, and a combination of both as alternatives for CEOR evaluation. 

? Evaluate the performance of vertical wells versus horizontal, directional wells and 

their placement. 

? Evaluate the performance of other CEOR oil recovery mechanisms.
