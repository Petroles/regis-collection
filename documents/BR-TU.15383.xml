Dedication 

"I may have defects, live eager and get angry sometimes, but do not forget that my life is the 

greatest company in the world. And I can prevent it from going bankrupt. Being happy is to 

recognize that life is worth living, despite all the challenges, misunderstandings and periods of 

crisis. Being happy is to stop being a victim of the problems and become an author of history 

itself. It is to cross deserts outside ourselves, but being able to find an oasis deep in our soul. 

It is to thank God every morning for the miracle of life. Being happy is to be unafraid of our 

own feelings. It is to talk about ourselves. Is to have the courage to hear a ‘no’. Is to be strong 

enough to listen to a criticism, even if unfair... Stones on the path? I keep them all, one day I 

will build a castle.” (Fernando Pessoa). 

I dedicate my thesis to my beloved daughter Beatriz that, unfortunately, became an angel in 

Heaven too earlier.

Resumo 

Objetivo: Esta tese inclui três estudos relacionados com o ensino da natação, procurando 

cumprir com os seguintes objetivos: (i) descrever a organização e metodologia de ensino da 

natação desenvolvida em Portugal, em contexto educativo (primeiro ciclo do ensino básico); 

(ii) analisar as diferenças na competência aquática adquirida entre dois programas de ensino 

da natação, em contextos de profundidade distintos (água rasa e profunda); (iii) analisar as 

mudanças longitudinais no desenvolvimento motor global de crianças, após cinco, dez e 30 

meses de prática de natação e de futebol. Métodos: Para o primeiro estudo, a amostra incluiu 

89 coordenadores pedagógicos de escolas de natação e 100 professores de natação. Em ambos 

os grupos amostrais foram aplicados questionários para apurar a organização e metodologia de 

ensino da natação. Para o segundo estudo, a amostra foi constituída por 21 crianças (4,70 ± 

0,51 anos), de ambos os géneros e sem qualquer experiência em programas de ensino da 

natação. A amostra foi dividida em dois grupos experimentais, que foram sujeitos a um 

programa similar de ensino da natação, durante seis meses, mas variável na profundidade do 

espaço aquático (piscina de água rasa; piscina de água profunda). Para o terceiro estudo, a 

amostra foi composta por 33 crianças (4,8 ± 0,5 anos). A amostra foi dividida em três grupos: 

grupo de controlo; grupo praticante de futebol; grupo praticante de natação. Foi utilizado o 

Test Gross Motor Development - 2nd Edition para avaliar o desenvolvimento motor global em 

três momentos distintos: após cinco, dez e trinta meses de prática desportiva. Resultados: Os 

resultados do primeiro estudo sugerem que a natação no primeiro ciclo do ensino básico rege-

se, sobretudo, pelas orientações do Ministério da Educação. Os principais objetivos das aulas 

estão relacionados com a adaptação ao meio aquático, privilegiando-se as habilidades aquáticas 

básicas (81,4%), num ensino pouco suportado em material pedagógico. No segundo estudo, os 

resultados sugerem que o ensino em piscina rasa permite adquirir um nível superior de 

competência aquática, em particular em cinco habilidades aquáticas básicas. No terceiro 

estudo, os dados apontam, em ambos os grupos (futebol e natação), para uma melhoria 

significativa do quociente motor bruto e dos scores padrão, na locomoção e controlo de objetos 

entre T5 e T10. Os praticantes de futebol atingem um quociente máximo de desenvolvimento 

motor após 10 meses de prática. Os praticantes de natação apresentaram um desenvolvimento 

motor (entre T10 e T30) gradual, particularmente em habilidades de controlo de objetos. 

Conclusões: Os dados descritos no primeiro estudo permitiram-nos identificar algumas 

insuficiências no enquadramento da natação no primeiro ciclo do ensino básico, provavelmente 

por condicionantes da eficiência do processo de ensino-aprendizagem, ao nível da aquisição de 

habilidades aquáticas mais complexas. Para além disso, os resultados sugerem que as sessões 

de natação em baixa profundidade parecem facilitar o desenvolvimento da competência 

aquática em crianças, após seis meses de prática. Foi também concluído que a prática 

desportiva (natação e futebol) durante a infância pode contribuir para um maior 

desenvolvimento motor.

Resumo Alargado 

Objetivos: Esta tese encontra-se dividida em três propósitos principais, consubstanciados em 

três estudos relacionados com o ensino da natação: (i) descrever a organização e metodologia 

de ensino da natação desenvolvida em Portugal, no âmbito da disciplina de Expressão e 

Educação Física, no primeiro ciclo do ensino básico; (ii) analisar as diferenças na competência 

aquática adquirida entre dois programas similares de ensino da natação, orientados em 

contextos de profundidade distintos (água rasa e profunda); (iii) analisar as mudanças 

longitudinais no desenvolvimento motor global de crianças, após cinco, dez e 30 meses de 

prática de natação e de futebol. 

Métodos: Para o primeiro estudo, a amostra incluiu 89 coordenadores pedagógicos de escolas 

de natação e 100 professores de natação. Em ambos os grupos amostrais, foram aplicados 

questionários com vista a apurar a organização e metodologia de ensino da natação, no contexto 

particular do primeiro ciclo do ensino básico. O questionário aos coordenadores incluiu os 

seguintes itens: (i) caracterização geral dos coordenadores com e sem natação no primeiro ciclo 

do ensino básico e professores; (ii) caracterização da organização institucional das escolas de 

natação em estudo; (iii) enquadramento do ensino da natação no primeiro ciclo do ensino básico 

(quando existe). O questionário aos professores que ministravam aulas de natação a crianças 

do primeiro ciclo do ensino básico (em contexto escolar) incluiu os seguintes itens: (i) 

caracterização geral dos inquiridos; (ii) enquadramento / finalidade do ensino da natação em 

crianças no 1º CEB; (iii) enquadramento do ensino da natação no primeiro ciclo do ensino básico, 

conhecimento das diretrizes para o ensino da natação dadas pelo Ministério da Educação de 

Portugal; (iv) organização metodológica do ensino da natação, no primeiro ciclo do ensino 

básico. Tratando-se de uma pesquisa de campo, foi utilizada estatística descritiva para a análise 

dos dados, em particular o cálculo das frequências das respostas.  

Para o segundo estudo, foi recrutada uma amostra de 21 crianças portuguesas (4,70 ± 0,51 

anos), de ambos os géneros e sem qualquer experiência em programas de ensino da natação. 

As crianças foram divididas em dois grupos experimentais, que foram sujeitos a um programa 

similar de ensino da natação, mas variável na profundidade do espaço aquático (n=10, programa 

aquático em água rasa; n=11, programa aquático em água profunda). Cada participante foi 

avaliado duas vezes na sua prontidão aquática, utilizando um formulário de observação de 17 

habilidades motoras aquáticas: durante a primeira sessão (T0) e após seis meses de prática – 

duas sessões por semana, no total de 48 sessões - (T1). Recorreu-se ao test t para comparar a 

proficiência aquática de cada habilidade entre os grupos e a uma análise discriminante dos 

registos de proficiência aquática, para construir um modelo preditivo de ambos os contextos 

de prática. 

Para o terceiro estudo, a amostra foi composta por 33 crianças (4,8 ± 0,5 anos.): 11 crianças 

constituíram o grupo de controlo (5,3 ± 0,2 anos); 11 crianças eram praticantes de futebol com 



 

 

 

x 

cinco meses de experiência; 11 crianças eram praticantes de natação (4,6 ± 0,4 anos) com cinco 

meses de experiência. Foi utilizado o Test Gross Motor Development - 2nd Edition (TGMD-2) 

para avaliar o desenvolvimento motor global e a proficiência motora, em 12 habilidades 

motoras fundamentais [habilidades de locomoção e de controlo de objetos], em três momentos 

distintos: após cinco (T5), dez (T10) e trinta (T30) meses de prática desportiva. Os testes foram 

gravados em vídeo e, à posterior, foram analisados e avaliados de acordo com o desempenho 

individual para cada habilidade motora, de acordo com os critérios previamente validados. Em 

todos os estudos, os dados foram agrupados e analisados estatisticamente, tendo sido 

considerado significativo um valor de p ? 0,05.  

Resultados: Os resultados do primeiro estudo sugerem que a natação no primeiro ciclo do 

ensino básico rege-se sobretudo pelas orientações do Ministério da Educação. A restrição 

orçamental (60,0%) e a dificuldade no transporte dos alunos da escola para a piscina (54,0%) 

são as razões mais apontadas para a supressão da natação do plano de ensino escolar. O ensino 

é dirigido fundamentalmente para o terceiro e o quarto anos (80,1%), com aulas de frequência 

semanal (64,4%), em classes com um elevado número de alunos (13 a 16 alunos). Os principais 

objetivos das aulas estão relacionados com a adaptação ao meio aquático, privilegiando-se as 

habilidades aquáticas básicas (81,4%), num ensino pouco suportado em material pedagógico. 

No segundo estudo, os resultados sugerem que o ensino em baixa profundidade permite adquirir 

um maior grau de competência aquática, em particular nas seguintes habilidades aquáticas 

básicas (p&amp;lt;0,05): controlo respiratório, imersão da face e abertura dos olhos; flutuação 

horizontal; posição corporal (equilíbrio) no deslize ventral; posição corporal (equilíbrio) no 

deslize dorsal; batimento de pernas ventral com controlo respiratório, sem apoio de material 

flutuador. A função discriminante revelou uma associação significativa entre os dois grupos e 

em quatro fatores (habilidades aquáticas) (p&amp;lt;0,001), representando (0,938) ^ 2 = 88% entre 

variabilidade do grupo. A posição corporal no deslize foi o principal preditor relevante (r = 

0,535). No terceiro estudo, os resultados sugerem que ambos os grupos (futebol e natação) 

melhoraram significativamente no seu quociente motor bruto e nos seus scores padrão, na 

locomoção e controlo de objetos entre T5 e T10. Em T10, todos os praticantes de futebol 

alcançaram a classificação máxima descritiva para o quociente motor bruto. Entre T10 e T30, 

os praticantes de natação melhoraram os scores padrão no controlo de objetos. Após 30 meses 

de prática desportiva, não foram encontradas diferenças significativas (p&gt; 0,05) entre ambos 

os grupos experimentais. 

Conclusões: Os dados relatados no primeiro estudo permitiram-nos identificar algumas 

insuficiências no enquadramento da natação, no primeiro ciclo do ensino básico, provavelmente 

por condicionantes da eficiência do processo de ensino-aprendizagem, ao nível da aquisição de 

habilidades aquáticas mais complexas. No segundo estudo, os resultados demonstram que as 

sessões de natação em água rasa parecem permitir um desenvolvimento superior da 

competência aquática em crianças, após um período de seis meses de prática. No último 

estudo, os dados sugerem que a prática desportiva (natação e futebol), durante a infância,

pode contribuir para um maior desenvolvimento motor. Apesar da prática de futebol parecer 

induzir um desenvolvimento motor acelerado e superior (a curto e longo prazo), em comparação 

com a prática de natação, os praticantes de natação apresentaram um desenvolvimento motor 

gradual, particularmente em habilidades de controlo de objeto.

Abstract 

Objective: This thesis includes three studies related to the teaching of swimming, with the 

following objectives: (i) to describe the organization and methodology of swimming teaching in 

Portugal, in the context of school education (elementary school); (ii) to analyze and compare 

the efficiency between the two program types of swimming teaching (practice in shallow water 

and practice in deep water); (iii) to analyze the longitudinal changes in the gross motor 

development of children, after five, ten and 30 months practicing swimming and soccer in 

parallel. Methods: For the first study, the sample included 89 pedagogical coordinators of 

swimming schools and 100 swimming teachers. We have done a survey with both groups to 

assess the level of organization and methodology of swimming teaching.  For the second study, 

the sample was composed by 21 children (4.70 ± 0.51years), of both genders and with no 

experience with swimming learning programs. The sample was organized in two experimental 

groups, which have followed a similar swimming learning program during six months, but using 

different water depths (one using shallow water, the other using deep water). For the third 

study, the sample was composed by 33 children (4.8 ± 0.5 years). The sample was organized in 

three groups: control group, soccer group, swimming group. We have used the Test Gross Motor 

Development – 2nd Edition to evaluate the gross motor development in three different 

moments: after five, ten and 30 months of practice of both sports. Results: the results of the 

first study indicate that the swimming practice in the elementary school is conducted following 

the orientations from the Portuguese Ministry of Education. At this level, the swimming practice 

is focused on the aquatic readiness, giving more attention to basic aquatic skills (81.4%), where 

the teaching model rarely includes pedagogical material. In the second study, the results 

indicate that we can achieve a better performance (higher level of aquatic competence) in 

shallow water than in deep water, especially with acquiring the five basic aquatic skills. In the 

third study, the results indicate that, in both groups (soccer and swimming), there’s a 

significant improvement of the gross motor coefficient and the standard scores in the 

locomotion and control of objects, between T5 and T10. The soccer practitioners have reached 

the higher motor development coefficient, after 10 months of practice. The swimming 

practitioners have a gradual motor development (between T10 and T30), especially with 

regards to object control skills. Conclusions: with the data of the first study, we could find 

some deficiencies in the integration of swimming practice in the elementary school’s program 

and probably those are limitations of the efficiency of the teaching method adopted, in respect 

to the acquisition of more complex aquatic skills. By the results of the second study, the 

development of aquatic skills, by children after six months of practice, seems to be easier in 

shallow water that in deep water. The data collected with the last study indicate that sports 

(both swimming and soccer) during childhood can contribute for a higher gross motor 

development of children.

Chapter I: Problem definition and thesis 

structure 

1.1 Introduction 

The underlying theoretical foundation of this thesis is based on, at least, the following two 

context levels: 

? The clarification of the paradigm subjacent to the swimming teaching, recognizing the 

current methodological principals accepted among the scientific community, that can 

be the guidance to both the subsequent development of scientific research and to the 

pedagogical intervention and organization;  

? The recognition of the importance of the psychomotor stimulation during childhood, 

emphasizing the importance of swimming practice in the global development of 

children. 

Over the next sections, we will briefly frame out the key information about these topics and 

will finish by presenting the relevant implications on the overall structure of this thesis. 

 

1.1.1 Theoretical concepts related to the swimming teaching 

Theoretical knowledge of swimming teaching requires the correct understanding of the 

concepts "aquatic competence” and “learn to swim", which are, in fact, conceptually different, 

although they are traditionally considered to be the same or related things. Therefore, we 

should start a swimming teaching program by assuming the individual has a total inability in the 

aquatic environment, or is not capable at all of performing any oriented action in the water 

(Canossa, Fernandes, Carmo, Andrade, &amp;amp; Soares, 2007). Indeed, the movement in the aquatic 

environment is peculiar and unfriendly: the water affects and modifies the person’s motor 

control because it generates permanent lack of balance and comfort (eyes, nose, ears and 

mouth). In fact, this impact is caused by the physical and chemical properties of the water and 

its intrinsic mechanism, which are shaping the interaction of this environment with bodies in 

contact with or moving through it.  Considering such differences when comparing the aquatic 

environment with the terrestrial environment, it is mandatory to develop specific skills to 

overcome the constraint we find in this particular environment, with respect to balance, 

propulsion and breathing in the water. Thus, the main objective of the adaptation to the 

aquatic environment, while an elementary step of the swimming learning, is to achieve a 

gradual acquisition of competences in the water, which represents the starting point and is a 



 

 

 

19 

specific motor pre-requirement (i.e., basic movement skills in the water) for the practice of 

several water activities, such as swimming.  

According to Campaniço (1989), we use the control of the body in the water, based on a 

behavioral differentiation in five areas: balance, breathing, immersion, propulsion and jump. 

This way, the ability of swimming cannot be a natural skill (Langendorfer, 2014). There’s no 

doubt this is an ability the individual has to acquire by himself, to allow him/her to perform 

the proper actions towards achieving the required balance, breathing and propulsion (Barbosa, 

2005). According to several authors (Campaniço &amp;amp; Silva, 1998; Carvalho, 1994; Catteau &amp;amp; 

Garoff, 1990; Crespo &amp;amp; Sanchez, 1998; Navarro, 1995; Moreno &amp;amp; Sanmartín, 1998), the ability 

of swimming, besides representing a specific movement skill in the water, requires a previous 

condition of autonomy, confidence and satisfaction in the new environment. Therefore, and 

regardless of the use given to the swimming practice (educational or merely utilitarian 

purpose), it is very important that the priority of the didactic and pedagogical organization 

model of the swimming teaching should not be the immediate achievement of formal strokes, 

but, instead, the achievement of confidence by the child in the new environment. It is essential 

that researchers and teachers assume a developing and holistic approach of swimming learning. 

It seems that this guidance is presented on the proposal by Langendorfer and Bruya (1995), 

which is used as reference along this thesis. These authors recommend that the swimming 

learning should be based on a progressive behavioral change of children, resulting from the 

sequential learning of basic movement patterns (skills), based on three underlying 

cornerstones: hierarchy, differentiation and individualization of basic aquatic skills. This way, 

the aquatic skills must be considered a dynamic process that depends on the interaction of 

each individual with the water. This has relevant implications, including the prevention of 

drowning (Langendorfer, 2014). 

 

1.1.2 Developing aquatic competence in young children 

A well-succeeded learning of complex motor behaviors depends on the understanding of the 

pedagogical theory related to the sport movement education (in particular, swimming), on the 

organization and hierarchy of educational content and also on the correct teaching of it, which 

is, at the same, an importance level of the rest. 

With respect to the conceptual pedagogical understanding, the previous section has already 

addressed some of the key aspects that sustain the consequent didactics. In fact, we previously 

insisted on the importance of the aquatic competence that reflects the individual’s readiness 

to move in the water. Nevertheless, it’s also important to take into account other kind of 

understanding the teacher may have, as a person with his/her own perspective, someone who 

takes decisions, makes his/her own judgments and holds a certain guidance he/she believes to 

be appropriated to his/her professional activity (Carreiro da Costa, 1996). What objective do 

the teachers give to the training of the adaptation to the water? This is a concern which arises 



 

 

 

20 

from the known paradigm "teacher’s thought" (Clark &amp;amp; Lampert, 1986), which has great impact 

to the didactics of physical education, including, of course, the teaching of swimming. In fact, 

it is our perception that the technical community tends, sometimes, to disregard the basic 

aquatic skills as a bio-behavioral requirement to learn more complex and specialized aquatic 

skills (including the traditional four swimming strokes). This empirical sense seems to be 

reflected on the results presented by Costa et al. (2012), when they inquired swimming 

teachers about the main objective of teaching the adaptation to the water. The results revealed 

that the purpose "learn to swim" inevitably emerges as the most important goal of aquatic 

programs developed in deep water. However, we must highlight the alarming fact of the goal 

"don’t be afraid of water" doesn’t collect a 100% acceptance, although the "pleasure of practice" 

is seen as a consensual point. Several unstudied individual and institutional constraints will 

converge together to this conceptual misrepresentation. 

“How to teach aquatic skills and swimming?” This is another pedagogical issue we consider to 

be fundamental to the didactics of swimming, eventually delimited and included in a study 

category of the theoretical-implicit type, pre-conceptual and linked to the believing of teachers 

and their relationship with the teaching activity (Carreiro da Costa, 1996). The literature 

related to the teaching of swimming is poor in this topic.  However, and assuming that is only 

accepted systematized teaching methods, we globally consider two pedagogical perspectives: 

the analytical perspective and the synthetic perspective (Catteau &amp;amp; Garrof, 1990; Machado, 

1978). The validity of both perspectives to the teaching of swimming is undeniable, which 

makes difficult to define the limits of the application of each one (Marques &amp;amp; Gallardo, 2009). 

According to the authors, it is possible to speculate a bigger analytical tendency to the teaching 

of students already familiar with the water, more mature and wishing to learn swimming in a 

more efficient way, since it allows the rationalization and fragmentation of the swimming 

technique and make it closer to the biomechanical model of reference. The syntactic 

perspective, based on psychological approach of Gestalt (Greco, 1998), appears to be more 

appropriate in the process of adaptation to water, for beginner students of young age, since it 

puts such exercise in a certain context, getting the student's attention to solve adaptation 

issues. 

This logic allows us to understand the reason of certain behaviors in the teaching of swimming 

and, consequently, explain the swimming teaching-learning process. This leads us to several 

issues related to teacher’s planning (Carreiro da Costa, 1996), mainly the following ones: what's 

the teacher's thought when is making the plan and what are the differences of planning between 

teachers and in different contexts of learning? So, let’s drawn our attention to the teacher’s 

reflections when he/she is building up the teaching model – the set of specific strategies that 

come up when the sequence of the important aquatic skills is defined (Campaniço &amp;amp; Silva, 

1998).  

The balance between the planning, teacher’s behavior and student’s characteristics is another 

important concern to the teaching paradigm. This issue has a special importance in adapting 



 

 

 

21 

children to the aquatic environment, given the fact that is necessary to adjust the teaching 

model according to the child’s global development, especially in the cognitive, social and motor 

domains (Langerdorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995). Only this way can provide relevant experiences for a 

gradual acquisition of movement skills in the water, adjusted to the age and suitable to a 

certain level of technical proficiency. This topic is discussed in more detail along the next 

section.  

Finally, it is important to highlight there are several variables involved in the swimming 

teaching-learning process, most of them related to the particular characteristics of the water 

environment. In line with the process-product paradigm of Piéron (1988) (figure 1), we assume 

that the final stage of the student’s learning depends directly from the process’s variables, 

which are in turn influenced by the variables of the presage, context and program.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1: Process-product paradigm (according to Piéron, 1988). 

 

We are interested, in particular, in the context variables that affect the teacher's behavior, 

teaching organization and, as such, that determine the effectiveness of learning (Zuo, 2004). 

In fact, beyond the constraints imposed directly to the child by the characteristics of the 

aquatic environment (mentioned earlier), the teaching quality depends on the conditions 

available for teaching, the space allocated to the group of students and their learning capacity 

(Carvalho, 1994). According to several authors (Langendorfer, 2010; Murray, 1980 cited by Costa 

et al, 2012) these factors are: (i) the number of students in the class; (ii) the available 

equipment; (iii) the water temperature; (iv) the weekly frequency of classes and (v) the depth 

of the swimming pool.

22 

Despite of the lack of studies on this subject, the effect of some of these factors in the 

effectiveness of swimming teaching-learning process can be deduced based on the literature of 

educational sciences (Vickers, 1990). Indeed, a number of excessive class size affects 

undoubtedly the safety, effectiveness and quality of teaching, especially because the teacher 

has to give attention to more students. Regarding the weekly frequency of classes, it is well 

known that systematization of learning-teaching process (and also for successful sporting 

performance) is a basic requirement for behavioral modifications – in this context, it’s expect 

to have a bigger effect (both in the short and long term) on the acquisition of aquatic skills, 

with a program composed by three weekly sessions, comparing with a program with just one or 

two sessions per week.  

There isn’t much information about studies done on the effectiveness of didactic equipment to 

use in the swimming learning, including floating devices (Erbaugh, 1986). One of the few studies 

in this domain has demonstrated the importance of the use of these devices in the horizontal 

dynamic balance. However, other authors (Blanksby, Parker, Bradley, &amp;amp; Ong, 1995; 

Langendorfer, 1987) advise not to use these devices in the learning of fluctuation and 

hydrodynamic positioning. The main reason seems to be the reasonable use of auxiliary devices 

(Barbosa, 2004; Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995; Moreno &amp;amp; Sanmartin, 1998; Navarro, 1995), 

avoiding student’s dependence on a false perception of autonomy, which leads to the 

development of artificial aquatic skills (Soares, 2000). This appears to be the same 

understanding of the teachers of some Portuguese swimming schools that have a moderate use 

of didactic material in the adaptation to the water environment, where boards are the favorite 

equipment (Costa et al., 2012). 

With regards to the water temperature, both the international recommendations (Water &amp;amp; 

World Health Organization, 2006) and the national recommendations (Normative 23/93 CNQ) 

suggest values between 30 ºC and 32ºC. To our knowledge there are no studies demonstrating 

the effectiveness of the swimming teaching-learning process, in difference levels of 

temperature. Such studies should have to consider the characteristics of the students and the 

teaching program, which tends to be more "active" with lower temperatures. According to 

McArdle, Katch and Katch (2014), the ideal water temperature in competition should range 

from 28ºC to 30ºC, since the metabolic heat generated is easily transferred to the water without 

significant increases in the energy spending or reduction of the body’s temperature.  

From all context factors, the depth of the swimming pool seems to be the less studied factor. 

The recent study from Costa et al. (2012), one of few existing studies in this matter, analyzes 

the effects on the development of aquatic skills in two depth scenarios (shallow water and deep 

water), after six, 12 and 18 months of practice. Although the study design is cross-sectional, 

the results seem to indicate that children with up to 12 months of practice in shallow water 

have better results.

1.1.3 Motor development and aquatic experience 

Motor development, as part of the overall development of the human being, changes during 

person’s life. Although being frequently associated with childhood, we can see qualitative and 

quantitative changes in the proficiency of these motor actions from the conception of the 

human being to his death (Connolly, 2000; Santos, Dantas, &amp;amp; Oliveira, 2004). Despite this 

absolute point of view, childhood is assumed as a crucial period for the development of physical 

skills and basic psychomotor learning, which allow the acquisition of a diverse set of motor 

capabilities that will help the child to gradually develop more complex movements. It should 

be understood this is a sequential process, sustained in the child’s experiences that contribute 

to a solid and wide set of motor capabilities (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun 2005; Le boulch, 1987; Piaget, 

1975; Vygotsky, 1978). 

The motor development refers to changes in general categories of motor behavior (locomotion, 

manipulation and stabilization) conditioned by stimulation received and by the predisposition 

of the child to interact with the environment (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005). In this context, the 

lack of motor stimulation and wrong orientation of them may have a negative impact in the 

motor development expected to happen in that age (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005; Le Boulch, 1987; 

Piaget, 1975; Vygotsky, 1978), besides affecting the functional autonomy of the child in the 

daily life. Therefore, it’s extremely important to take good care of children’s motor literacy, 

looking for having good levels of development of fundamental movement skills suitable for that 

age.  These are considered to be building blocks of an appropriate level of physical fitness in 

the health perspective, and of the learning of specific motor skills required for sports 

modalities.  

The category of locomotor movements refers to the changing of body’s position in respect to a 

fixed point on the surface. It involves the projection of the human body on an external area, 

by changing body’s position in respect to a fixed point on the surface (e.g.: walking, running, 

jumping or skipping). In turn, the manipulative movements involve an individual's relationship 

with objects and is characterized by the force applied on them, as well as the strength received 

from them. The actions of "launch", "catch", "kick" and "intercept" objects are considered thick 

manipulative movements; movements like cutting with scissors are fine motor movements. The 

stabilization movements are those that allow the body to assume a posture in the space, in 

relation to the force of gravity. In this category, the child is involved in continuous efforts 

against the force of gravity, in an attempt to obtain and maintain bipedal posture. 

It is well known that, during the typical child's development, he/she goes through several stages 

(Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005), where there are periods of greater physical and cognitive 

willingness to assimilate and improve motor skills (Peres, Serrano, &amp;amp; Cunha, 2009). In fact, the 

theoretical model of Gallahue and Ozmun (2005) seems to be the consensus in terms of existing 

literature, suggesting four major phases of stable behavior, or, at least, relatively consistent: 

reflex movements, rudimentary movements, basic movements and specialized movements. For 



 

 

 

24 

each phase of the process are indicated stages with corresponding (presumed) chronological 

ages. This phase-stage process was conceptualized in the form of a heuristic hourglass (Gallahue 

&amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005), as shown in Figure 2; this framework is the typical motor development 

throughout lifetime, where the inverted triangle is a schematic representation of the 

transactional processes that affect the motor development (task, individual and environment). 

Most children have a great potential for development of fundamental movement skills, that 

allows the child to start his/her transaction to the phase of specialized movements, around the 

age of 6 years old (Gallahue, 2005). The development of fundamental movement follows a 

sequence of stages, characterized by gradual proficiency levels, reflecting the quality of one’s 

motor control (Carvalhal, 2000; Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005): 

Initial stage: in this stage, children try their first movements, which are incomplete and 

uncoordinated, with no rhythmic coordination. In a nutshell, these movements have a poor 

space-time integration;  

Elementary stage: during this stage, children have greater control of their movements and have 

better rhythmic and space-time coordination. However, there is still a lack of spontaneity at 

this stage. Most adults remain at this stage, since they progress up to it just because of the 

influence of the maturity;  

Mature stage: most fundamental motor skills can be reached at the age of six or seven years 

old, but some kids may reach this stage earlier. This stage is characterized as being more 

effective and revealing coordinated and controlled movements.  

According to Gallahue (2005), the anatomical, physiological and neural characteristics are 

enough developed towards operating in a mature stage for the majority of fundamental 

movement skills. The exceptions are mainly a result of limited opportunities to practice. For 

all this, the coordinated practice of sports can play a catalytic role, because it gives the 

opportunity of performing important motor experiences that include stimulation to develop 

fundamental motor skills (Martins, Silva, Marinho, &amp;amp; Costa, 2015; Pereira, 1990) and its 

subsequent optimization to the specific context of each sport. These are considered an 

essential part to both appropriate physical capability, in a health perspective, and to the 

learning of specific movement skills necessary to the practice of the sport modalities (Flinchum, 

1982; Gallahue, 2006; Harrow, 1983; Tani, 2011). It is clearly a key period to contact with new 

sports and different contexts of practice, including swimming (Martins et al., 2015).

Figure 2: Descriptive model (heuristic hourglass) of a motor development during lifetime (Gallahue 
&amp;amp; Ozmun, 2006; adapted from Gallahue, 2005). 

 

Swimming is one of the few guided physical activities that can be practiced starting from the 

six months of age (Moreno, Pena, Castillo, &amp;amp; Vegué, 2004) and about which is believed to 

contribute to the harmonious development of the child (Gallahue, 1993). However, the studies 

in this area are particularly rare, focusing especially on children with disabilities (Beckung, 

Carlsson, Carlsdotter, &amp;amp; Uvebrant, 2007; Bredekamp, &amp;amp; Copple, 1997; Haywood &amp;amp; Getchell, 

2004). We highlight the work from Fragala?Pinkham, Haley, &amp;amp; O’Neil (2008) and Hutzler, 

Chacham, Bergman, and Szeinberg (1998), which demonstrates the effects of water activities 

in the increase of mobility and muscle strength in children with physical disabilities. In respect 

to babies, early aquatic experience seems to improve some motor skills, such as balance, and 

achieve motor development of newborn babies, including the head control. The studies are 

even rarer in respect to the childhood phase. Even so, it is expected to have a positive effect 

on the gross and fine motor capability of children between seven and nine years old (Paula &amp;amp; 

Belo, 2009). In the school context, the aquatic experience seems to lead to an optimal state of 

motor development in various skills, particularly in the manipulation of objects (Martins et al., 

2015). Other studies have found effects on the neuromuscular development and on the 

performance of the cardiovascular and respiratory system (Zhao et al., 2005). Bernard (2010); 

Font-Ribera et al., (2011) ;Wang and Hung (2009) demonstrates a positive impact of swimming 

in children with cardiorespiratory diseases (e.g.: asthma). Other authors (Gorter &amp;amp; Currie, 2011;

effects at different levels: reduction of behavior and sleep disorders; anorexia; neuro-

psychomotor development deficits; hypotonia; orthopedic, neurological and respiratory 

disorders. More recently (Jorgensen, 2012), studies have demonstrated the positive and 

significant effect of swimming (comparing with the population in general) on the intellectual 

development, particularly language. 

 

1.2 Problem definition and objective of this thesis 

The previous theoretical framework put us under three main concerns that made us do this 

work. 

The first concern is closely related to the swimming in the elementary school, which was 

formally established by decision of the Minister of Education of Portugal (Despacho nº 

12591/2006 – DR nº 115, Series II, 2006-06-16), in which the physical activities are included in 

the education offer. This program aimed to guarantee all students access to a set of activities 

that would add value to their school program, in the elementary school, with the objective of 

developing the child’s capacity in several domains (e.g.: psychomotor, social-affective and 

cognitive) (Fialho et al., 2013). With respect to physical activities and sports, the available 

program guidelines (Maria &amp;amp; Nunes, 2006) define the objectives and the program’s generic 

operationalization, while giving great flexibility to extend the field of physical and motor 

experience of children. In this context, swimming is considered optional, although this activity 

was appointed as an activity “never or rarely” introduced (77.3%), despite being a favorite 

activity for the students (47.9%) (Fialho et al., 2013). However, we couldn’t find any study 

about neither the way the contents are implemented or supervised, nor the effectiveness of 

the implemented programs.  It’s therefore important to know how the swimming teaching is 

organized and the existing teaching methodologies. This need has triggered the following 

question: How is the swimming teaching included in the Physical and Motor Education program, 

during elementary education in Portugal?  

Our second concern is related to the fact there are almost no studies about the influence of 

several context factors that are linked to the acquisition of aquatic skills by small kids. One of 

the key factors seems to be the variation of water’s depth, very common in swimming schools 

in Portugal, both in the educational and non-educational offers. Excluding the cases where 

there’s no infrastructural alternative, we believe the reasons the adaptation to aquatic 

environment is done in deep water are the following: technical decision or merely commercial 

management. The reason for the first situation is mainly empirical, because there are almost 

no studies about this topic and the existing ones – as far as we know – follow a basic approach 

and with no control of the educational program used. Regarding the second situation, technical-

scientific arguments are excluded but also the regulatory ones, given the fact there’s no 

specific legislation about the swimming teaching, especially with regards to the safety rules 



 

 

 

27 

(size of classes, water’s depth adjusted to the leaning level). Therefore, we make the following 

question: Does the depth of water, during aquatic competence lessons, bring any impact to 

the acquisition of basic water skills by children?  

The third concern of this dissertation is about the dependency of the motor development from 

sport practices (Kambas et al., 2012). In the same reason a reduced or inadequate physical 

stimulation may affect the child’s motor development (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005; Williams et 

al., 2008), an inadequate motor development will be inhibitory for the practice of physical 

activity (e.g. Stodden et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2008).  In the long run, it will create a higher 

probability of the child to be sedentary when he/she becomes adult (Huotari, Nupponen, Mik-

kelsson, Laakso &amp;amp; Kujala, 2011). Therefore, we must consider the childhood is not just a critical 

age to develop motor capabilities, but to enable the child to practice sport (Barnett, Beurden, 

Morgan, Brooks, &amp;amp; Beard, 2009; Stodden et al., 2008).  

Like we mentioned before, achieving a mature stage of these capabilities is closely dependent 

on the opportunities to practice physical activities (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005). Normally, the 

studies address the effects the community’s intervention has on this matter, choosing 

experimental designs with isolated groups (with no control group) and during small periods of 

time (less than six months) (Smith et al., 2014). The catalytic role of the formal sport practice 

in the gross motor development is, therefore, very little known. We consider this lack of 

literature of special importance mainly because several kids don’t benefit from a structured 

sport practice at school, especially during the preschool. The motor experiences during the 

childhood (especially at the age of six) result quite often from the practice of sports by the 

initiative of the child and his/her family and not necessarily from an official program (for 

instance at school). In this context, swimming is one of the most favorite sports. By itself, the 

water seems to provide important stimulations to the body’s perception, giving a positive effect 

over prehension and balance (Sigmundsson &amp;amp; Hopkins, 2010). Besides that, the games and 

several other fun activities are an appropriate methodology to achieve the aquatic readiness 

at that age levels. Thus, it’s important to evaluate the following: which effects can we expect 

from the oriented practice of sports and in particular from swimming, in the gross motor 

development of child? 

Considering that the study’s problem is defined, and aiming to bring a contribution to the state 

of art of this scientific domain, the study has the following objectives: 

To analyze the implementation of a swimming program included in the scope of the Expression 

and Physical Motor Education, in the elementary school, in Portugal, specifically describing: (a) 

the methodological organization of swimming teaching; (b) the methodologies of teaching 

swimming actually used; (c) the application of the teaching-learning process, especially by 

identifying the privileged aquatic skills; (d) the reason to have a swimming program.  



 

 

 

28 

To analyze the improvements of the aquatic skills of the kids, after they have accomplished 

the aquatic competence program, conducted in different depth levels (shallow water and deep 

water), during six months.  

To analyze the longitudinal changes in the gross motor development of children, after five, ten 

and 30 months practicing swimming and football.  

 

1.3 Structure of the thesis 

Considering the assumptions above, this document is organized in chapters, based on the North 

European model (normally known as the Scandinavian model), that results from the compilation 

of three experimental studies.  

The text body of this dissertation is divided in five chapters. The “chapter I” has the overview, 

including the formal justification, the problem definition, the objectives and the presentation 

of the document’s structure. The following three chapters (II, III and IV) result each one from 

the three main points of this dissertation: the “chapter II” analyzes the organization and 

methodology of the swimming teaching, in the elementary school in Portugal; the “chapter III” 

presents the analysis of the aquatic skills acquired during two equivalent programs, one 

conducted in shallow water and the other in deep water; the “chapter IV” presents the analysis 

of the short term, midterm and long term effects in the child’s global motor development 

brought by the practice of swimming and football, during childhood. The articles are written in 

English, following the standards proposed by the University of Beira Interior, notwithstanding 

the fact they have been published under a different format by specialized journals and some 

of them written in Portuguese. The “chapter V” has the final conclusions, the limitations of the 

dissertation as well as questions/suggestions for future research.

Chapter II: Organization and 

methodology of swimming teaching in 

the elementary school in Portugal 

2.1 Content 

This chapter presents the analysis of the organization and methodology of the swimming 

teaching in the elementary school in Portugal. 

 

2.2 Summary 

The main objective of this study was to know the organization and the swimming learning 

methodology developed under the Expression and Physical Motor Education in the first level 

basic education in Portugal. The sample included 89 pedagogical coordinators of local swimming 

schools and 100 swimming teachers working at those schools. Two questionnaires were used to 

assess the organization and teaching methodology and the results were described based on 

descriptive statistical analysis. The results suggest that swimming in the first level basic 

education is governed according to the guidelines from Ministry of Education. The budget cut 

(60.0% less) and the difficulty in transporting school students (54.0%) to the swimming pool are 

the main reasons mentioned for the suppression of swimming. Teaching is primarily directed to 

the third and fourth grade (80.1%), with weekly frequency (64.4%) and classes with a high 

number of students (13 to 16 students). The main objective of the classes is the children’s 

adaptation to the aquatic environment, focusing on the basic aquatic skills (81.4%), with very 

little use of pedagogic material. With the data collected, we were able to identify some 

weaknesses in the framework of swimming teaching, in the 1st level of basic education, probably 

because of the constraints of the teaching-learning process, at the level of more complex skills. 

Keywords: Swimming; teaching methods; aquatic skills; children. 

 

2.3 Introduction 

The overall development of the child is sequential and cumulative, sustained in experiences 

that contribute to a solid group of motor skills (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun 2005; Le Boulch, 1987; 

Piaget, 1975; Vygotsky, 1978). Childhood is seen as a critical period for the development of 

physical skills and basic psychomotor learning, extending this period up to the age of the last 

year of the 1st level of basic education. 



 

 

 

36 

Besides that, and according to the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (2008), the 

physical exercise during childhood brings a lot of benefits to children’s development (social, 

cognitive and physical), in the mid and long term, such as reducing the fat mass, reducing the 

risk of cardiovascular diseases, type two diabetes and psychological benefits (psychological 

well-being, self-esteem, reduce anxiety and depression). A recent study (Huotari et al., 2011) 

shows that children and adolescents that are physically active have less probability to be 

sedentary when they are adults. On the other hand, we also know that the lack or bad motor 

stimulation can have a very negative impact in the child’s development (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 

2005; Leboulch, 1987; Piaget, 1975; Vygotsky, 1978). 

In this perspective, we consider the swimming practice during childhood a harmonious exercise 

that contributes to the full development of the child and, at the same time, reduces the risk 

of drowning. However, to our knowledge there are no solid scientific evidences that aquatic 

activities actually reduce the risk of drowning (Asher, Rivara, Felix, Vance &amp;amp; Dunne, 1995). 

Regarding the motor development, the study of Zhao et al. (2005) reports positive effects of 

the application of aquatic activity programs. Additionally, it was observed a positive impact on 

the neuromuscular development and on the functional capacity of the cardiovascular and 

respiratory systems. Other authors (Kemp &amp;amp; Roberts, 2005; McManus &amp;amp; Kotelchuk 2007 Wicher, 

et al, 2010; Gorter &amp;amp; Currie, 2011) refer supporting effects at different levels: reduction of 

behavior and sleep disorders; anorexia; deficit of the neuro-psychomotor development; 

hypotonias; orthopedic, neurological and respiratory disorders. In addition to these benefits, 

the practice of swimming naturally contributes to the learning of basic, specific and complex 

motor skills in a wider context of aquatic competence (Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995) that should 

be developed particularly during childhood (Blanksby et al., 1995). However, there are 

limitations to the swimming practice, which often requires a prior medical advice. Hearing 

protection should be used to prevent in the case of otitis, sinusitis and chronic rhinitis as well 

as appropriate water glasses to protect eye sensitivity. 

The Expression and Physical Motor Education, as part of the required range of activities included 

in the program of the first level of basic education, which encompasses several key content to 

the child's development, includes swimming as one of the optional modalities of the program. 

Due to the unique characteristics of this sport, the need of special facilities and teachers with 

the right preparation, it’s not always possible to include swimming in the regular school 

program. Besides that, the quality of the swimming teaching depends on many factors, mainly 

those that directly influence its organization and, therefore, determine its effectiveness.  

According  to Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Campaniço (1989), we refer particularly to 

the following factors: (i) the number of students – as a factor that determines the quality of 

education; (ii) the didactic material - that allows variability of stimulations in the class; (iii) 

water temperature – that should range between 30º and 32º C; (iv) the number of classes per 

week - usually two times in childhood (between three and ten years old); (v) the depth of the 

swimming pool – making use of several methodological strategies used in deep swimming pools, 



 

 

 

37 

when the class is small (six to twelve students). According to Carvalho (1994), the quality of 

education depends on the teaching conditions, the space available to the class and is related 

to the learning progress of the students. 

Although there are guidelines about how to develop physical exercise and sports during the 

elementary school, currently there are no studies in Portugal about how this is done on the 

field and about the achievements made. Moreover, the commission that is responsible to 

supervise the application of the program, which presents annual pedagogical reports, has been 

saying that the mechanisms to collect report data are not compliant with the teaching program, 

besides the fact that there is relevant data that is not being considered and other data that is 

being collected but not always relevant for such analysis. 

Therefore, in this study we have decided to describe and analyze the implementation of the 

swimming program in the context of the Expression and Physical Motor Education class of the 

elementary school in Portugal, currently conducted by the Local Administration. We aim to 

know the following topics: (i) the organization of teaching methodology; (ii) the methodologies 

applied in swimming practice; (iii) the effective implementation of the teaching-learning 

process (identify which basic aquatic skills are preferential); (iv) find out why swimming is not 

included in the school program. 

 

2.4 Method 

2.4.1 Experimental design 

This study is essentially a descriptive field research, with a quantitative analysis of the data 

collected, which main purpose is to know the teaching of swimming, in the context of the 

Expression and Physical Motor Education class, in the elementary school in Portugal. 

 

2.4.2 Sample 

Data was collected during the school year of 2010/2011, in 89 Portuguese municipalities – 

municipal swimming pools that participated in this study, corresponding to 30.2% of the 

Portuguese municipalities (table 1). The 89 pedagogical coordinators of those swimming schools 

were divided in two groups:  

Municipal swimming pools that are providing swimming classes to the local elementary school 

(corresponding to a total of 59 pedagogical coordinators – 47 men and 12 women);  

Municipal swimming pools that are not providing swimming classes to the local elementary 

school (corresponding to a total of 30 pedagogical coordinators – 26 men and four women); 



 

 

 

38 

Additionally, 100 swimming teachers, teaching swimming in the elementary school at those 

locations, agreed to participate in this study (65 men and 35 women, 31.9 + 5.5 years old, 3.19 

+ 0.89 years of professional experience).  

 

2.4.3 Instruments and procedures 

We submitted a questionnaire to the pedagogical coordinators of swimming schools with or 

without swimming practice in the elementary school of that area, with the objective to get 

from them the data to analyze the context of swimming practice and the factors related with 

teaching of swimming in the elementary school. The questionnaire was elaborated following 

Wilkinson and Birmingham’s recommendations (2003). The majority of the questions included 

in this questionnaire are dichotomous questions (so, closed questions), based on Rasch’s model 

(1960) decreasing order of concordance, or even of the Likert’s type, with four levels of 

attribution. The final version of the questionnaire has included the following topics: (i) 

characterization of the respondents (gender, age, academic degree, professional experience, 

number of teaching hours in the elementary school); (ii) characterization of the swimming 

learning environment (water temperature, water depth, number of classes, weekly frequency); 

(iii) local learn-to-swim framework in the elementary school (if swimming exists or not in the 

elementary school; understanding the swimming practice guidelines from the Ministry of 

Education; the number of lessons of the swimming practice; the reason behind the decision of 

schools that have decided to remove swimming practice from their educational program) – 

annex 1. 

In parallel, the swimming teachers at elementary schools answered to a questionnaire with the 

following topics: (i) characterization of the respondents (gender, age, academic degree, 

professional experience); (ii) objectives of the swimming practice in the elementary school; 

(iii) the context of the swimming practice in the elementary school’s education program and 

the understanding of the swimming practice guidelines from the Ministry of Education; (iv) 

methodology of swimming practice in the elementary school (objectives, use of didactic 

material, didactic content application, importance of basic learning acquisition by students, 

application of these contents in the global learning of aquatic competences and formal 

strokes/techniques) – annex 2. 

Both questionnaires were adapted from Costa et al. (2012). We have used a control group in 

four different municipalities not included in the study’s sample, with the objective to have, 

later on, a higher clearness and objectiveness of the questions included in those questionnaires. 

The questionnaires were also reviewed by experts in swimming teaching.

The data above demonstrates a significant dissimilarity of gender at the management level, in 

particular at the pedagogical coordination level. About 50% of the pedagogical coordinators 

have 35 years old or more and almost all of them are graduated.   

Most of the inquired teachers have two or three years of professional experience (85%), teaching 

between six to ten hours of swimming practice in the elementary school (44%) and have a 

diverse weekly distribution of teaching hours: one to five hours a week (20%), six to ten hours 

a week (44%), 11 to 15 hours a week (22%). 

 

2.5.2 Organization of swimming schools 

According to the answers from the 89 pedagogical coordinators inquired, the water temperature 

in the context of swimming practice in the elementary school ranges from 28ºC to 31ºC. No 

school is using only deep water pools. 73% of inquired schools use both deep and shallow water 

pools and 27% use only shallow water pools.  

55% of the inquired elementary schools have swimming practice included on their educational 

program and 36.7% have not. The number of practice sessions in the elementary school ranges 

from nine to 16 sessions, during the school year. Classes have 13 to 16 students, with one 

practice session per week in most cases (64.4%). Most of the municipalities have between one 

and 15 elementary schools with swimming practice, especially in the third and fourth years. No 

class in the first year and about 20% in the second year. 

 

2.5.3 Context of swimming practice in the elementary school 

The following table shows the percentage of inquired schools with ongoing swimming practice 

and with previously swimming practice in the elementary school of their area (currently 

closed).

(*) AEP – Extracurricular Activities Program, swimming practice as additional educational activity, in the 
elementary school. 

 

According to table 2, swimming practice is essentially seen as an extra/complementary activity 

in about 73% of inquired schools. In those municipalities where swimming practice is now out 

of elementary school’s program, the swimming practice was provided by the municipality as 

extra school activity. In only a few cases, swimming practice was included in the Extracurricular 

Activities Program activities or was part of the elementary school’s program. At elementary 

schools, 67.8% of swimming lessons are provided by physical education teachers. 22% of the 

inquired pedagogical coordinators indicated that swimming lessons have the presence of both 

the physical education teacher and a trainer from a specialized swimming school. 

The following table shows the percentage of swimming practice in the elementary school 

education, where swimming practice is not included on the elementary school’s program. 30% 

of inquired municipalities never had swimming practice during elementary school. 60% of 

inquired municipalities had to cancel swimming practice because of insufficient budget.

More than 80% of the inquired individuals know the guidelines from the Ministry of Education. 

However, 13 swimming teachers and five pedagogical coordinators seem hardly committed to 

these guidelines but still promote swimming practice for school aged-children.  

The following table shows the opinion of the inquired swimming school managers about the 

sufficiency of the number of lessons generally comprised in the local swimming program (in the 

elementary school).

Table 6 presents the statistics about the transportation used by elementary students to go to 

the swimming pool and who is taking care of them during these trips.  

More than 71% of the municipalities included in this study provide this transport service. We 

see that about 56% of these students are going with school staff and 27% are going with the 

school teacher.

2.5.4 Methodology of swimming teaching in the elementary school  

The following table shows the opinion of inquired teachers about the purposes of swimming 

programs within the educational context (during elementary school). 

The list of six different possibilities above follows Rasch’s format (1960). The answers obtained 

indicate that the two most important objectives are “lose fear of water” and “pleasure”.

On the previous table, we see that more than 50% of teachers never or rarely use didactic 

material. Nevertheless, boards seem to be the most used equipment. Also, we see that arm 

floats are used sometimes.   

Table 9 shows the opinion of the inquired swimming teachers about the use of pedagogic 

contents during the teaching-learning process of swimming (adaptation to water environment 

and teaching basic stroke technique). 

In respect to adaptation to water, one can note that more attention is given (“always” column) 

to “water entry” (72%), “acquiring confidence in the water” (90%), “balance” (70%), “breathing 

control” (86%) and “propulsion with legs” (69%). Less attention is given (“sometimes” column) 

to “immersion in deep water” (59%) and body rotations (61% sometimes, 13% rarely). 

In respect to teaching official strokes/techniques, the most important points to the inquired 

swimming teachers (“always considered”) are the following: “water entry” (60%), “dynamic 

balance” (82%), “correct propulsion with legs” (74%) and “specific technical skills” (74%). On 

the other hand, results suggest that the following points are less important to these swimming 

teachers (“only sometimes”): “symmetric rotations” (62%), “correct propulsion with arms” 

(63%) and “rhythmic breathing control” (53%).

The results shown below indicates that, in general, all listed attitudes are important to the 

inquired teachers. Only two of them are a bit less relevant comparing to the others: “not afraid 

of water” and “know how to use equipment”. In terms of basic understanding, we see that 

“procedures and class organization”, “safety and rescue rules” and “games and fun activities” 

are the most important topics (“always”) for the inquired teachers, on this part.

2.6 Discussion 

2.6.1 Global description of the inquired individuals 

This study has the objective to analyze the implementation of swimming practice in the context 

of the Expression and Physical Motor Education, in the elementary school in Portugal. As we 

discuss below, the obtained results demonstrate that swimming practice is included essentially 

on the extracurricular plan of the third and fourth school years/levels, with focus on the basic 

aquatic skills, in line with the orientations given by the Portuguese Ministry of Education.  

In parallel, we have identified the causes of the inexistence of swimming practice in certain 

educational contexts and also some difficulties in putting it in the right position, probably 

because of some limitations of the efficiency of the teaching-learning process of swimming, in 

respect to learn more complex aquatic/swimming skills.  

With regards to the profile of the inquired pedagogical coordinator and swimming teachers, we 

see that the majority of them holds an academic degree on this specific field, probably due to 

the fact that swimming practice is included, in most cases, in the Extracurricular Activities 

Program (extra or complementary school activities) – which represents about 73% on our study, 

which requires professionals of physical activities and sports to have a specific qualification to 

be entitled to teach the Physical Education discipline in the elementary school and/or holding 

a degree in Sport Sciences. In the study by Brandão (2010), all the teachers that have 

participated on the study hold a degree in Sport and Physical Education as well. However, not 

all the teachers working on the Extracurricular Activities Program are familiar with the 

guidelines and objectives defined by the Ministry of Education (Brandão, 2010). We realized 

that the percentage of men in this professional activity is much higher than women, in 



 

 

 

47 

particular in the management positions (pedagogical coordinator). This proportion is certainly 

similar to the percentage of men and women with a degree in physical education and sports, 

in Portugal, although the rate between men and women becomes higher as we go up on the 

position level (from swimming teacher to pedagogical coordinator). 

With respect to the organization of swimming schools, we found that swimming practice is more 

frequent to find on the third and fourth year/level, in the elementary school. This happens 

probably because the guidelines of the educational programming (Maria &amp;amp; Nunes, 2006) only 

consider swimming practice in those years/levels.  

Teaching conditions appear to be globally appropriate for the purposes of the aquatic activity 

program. According to Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Campaniço (1989), the main factors 

are the following ones: the number of student (important for the teaching’s effectiveness and 

quality); the didactic material used (allows a wide range of activities during swimming lessons); 

the water temperature (shall be around 30ºC to 32ºC); and the pool depth (mostly shallow 

water). In fact, we found that in 40% of swimming pools the water temperature is around 

28/29ºC. Although Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Campaniço (1989) indicate that the water 

temperature should be between 30ºC to 32ºC, the Quality National Council recommends a 

maximum water temperature of 30ºC. The swimming pools owned by the Portuguese 

municipalities seem to follow that recommendation. With regards to pool depth, none of the 

schools included in this study is using only deep water. About 73% of them are using both deep 

and shallow water, simultaneously. In fact, and according to Costa et al. (2012), the decision 

of combining aquatic activities in both types of depth can be an added value and an appropriate 

option for the objective of the adaptation to aquatic environment at these ages. We couldn't 

figure out if the few schools (only 27%) that teach swimming only in shallow water are doing it 

because it was a management decision, or because they cannot access or build a swimming 

pool with both kind of depths.  

The number of students per class (between 13 to 16 students) and the low frequency of 

swimming lessons per week (the majority of cases studied are having one lesson per week) seem 

to be a less positive point found with this study. Both facts result in a lower quality and 

effectiveness of the swimming learning/teaching (Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995). According to 

Sarmento, Carvalho, Florindo and Raposo (1982), the process of acquiring skills in the aquatic 

environment depends on the use of appropriate instruments and methods. Therefore, the size 

of classes seems to have a relevant impact in the effectiveness of the swimming teaching, 

especially during the initial phase of adaptation to water and acquisition of basic swimming 

skills (Campaniço, 1991). According to that, Santos, Gonçalves and Pereira (1994) found that 

large classes (about 20 students per class), in a certain school, were having a negative impact 

in the success of swimming learning, comparing with two other schools with smaller classes 

(around 11 to 13 students per class). According to Carvalho (1994), the learning progress of the 

class has a direct impact from its size, independently of the qualification and experience of the 

teacher. In the long run, this brings a negative impact to the teaching quality. This author

highlights that deep water, i.e. where the student’s foot cannot touch the bottom of the pool, 

requires the teacher to provide a direct support to students. He also says that, because of 

effectiveness and safety, the maximum of students per teacher should be no more than four 

and this is the most recommended option during the phase of adaptation to water in deep 

swimming pools. 

The cause of the absence of swimming practice in the elementary school of 30 municipalities 

included in this study seems be budgetary constraints (60% of municipalities). Another difficulty 

found is the transportation of students to and from the swimming facilities. In our point of 

view, the absence of swimming practice during the childhood may create two problems. The 

first problem is about the lower development of motor skills, during the childhood, particularly 

the aquatic skills, that are key for a healthy cognitive, affective and psychomotor stimulation 

(Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995). This is especially important between the end of the preschool 

and the beginning of the elementary school (Blanksby et al., 1995; Courage, Reynolds, &amp;amp; 

Richards, 2006; Zhao et al., 2005). The second problem is the potential risk of drowning 

(Brenner, et al., 2009, Peden &amp;amp; McGee, 2003). 

During this study, we have noticed that the guidelines from the Ministry of Education are 

globally known and followed by swimming teachers (87%). The other teachers follow other 

program. In the majority of studied swimming schools, the swimming teaching follows a 

standard didactic unit, where the swimming teacher has to strictly follow the standard 

program/guidelines. In fact, only 39% of swimming teachers are involved in the definition and 

supervision of this didactic unit. 

According to our results, the two groups that participated in the survey (pedagogical 

coordinators and swimming teachers) consider to be positive to acquire basic aquatic skills in 

the elementary school and eventually to start learning basic stroke techniques, particularly 

front crawl and backstroke. It is also important to consider the statistics about the procedures 

and class organization (safety rules, rescue, games and fun activities). These topics are always 

taken into account, although with a lower level of importance.  

 

2.6.2 Organization of swimming pools included on this study 

One of the objectives of this study is to describe the methodology of swimming teaching for 

the elementary school. Swimming lessons are related to the adaptation to water and to the 

teaching with little didactic material. Based on the six objectives considered in this study, the 

result of the inquiries is in line with the study by Costa et al. (2012) and by Campaniço (1991), 

especially in respect to the adaptation to water, mainly in shallow water, during an initial 

phase. The pleasure and autonomy in the water are key aspects for the development of basic 

aquatic skills (Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995; Langendorfer, 2010). In fact, swimming practice in 

the elementary school contributes to the motor development and stimulates the practice of 

physical activities, specially swimming.  



 

 

 

49 

With this study, we found a very low usage of didactic material. Boards are the most used 

equipment, as also reported by Costa et al. (2012). As far as we know, there are very little 

scientific studies about the impact of using devices (didactic material) in aquatic readiness 

programs. Erbaugh (1986), one of those scarce studies, demonstrated how important is to use 

this equipment during the development of horizontal dynamic body balance (glides). However, 

more important is to understand the educational advantages of didactic equipment. For 

example, the fun when using such devices, associated with a certain teaching methodology that 

assumes the game in the water as a natural educational resource, which encompasses both the 

practitioner’s motivation and the pedagogical effectiveness, also known as compressive method 

by Moreno and Guitiérrez (1998).  

A few inquired teachers (even though they represent a small number) are worried with the use 

of arm floats. The excessive use of floating equipment (jackets and arm float) in the 

development of floating capability, or even body behavior in a dynamic situation, has been 

criticized by several authors (Barbosa, 2004; Blanksby et al., 1995; Costa et al., 2012; 

Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995; Soares, 2000). There are distinct opinions about using auxiliary 

material in swimming learning. Some authors discourage the use of floating equipment (Catteau 

&amp;amp; Garrof, 1988) due to its negative influence in floating and propulsion. Other authors consider 

that auxiliary equipment should only be used on moderated way (Barbosa, 2004; Langendorfer 

&amp;amp; Bruya, 1995; Moreno &amp;amp; Sanmartin, 1998; Navarro, 1995; Sarmento &amp;amp; Montenegro, 1992; 

Soares, 2000), avoiding the dependency of practitioners from a false perception of autonomy 

in the water, which develops an artificial aquatic competence, as a consequence of such 

(Soares, 2000). Nevertheless, the use of auxiliary equipment, according to Navarro (1995), 

increases safety sense, reduces tiredness and, therefore, the swimming practice can be more 

motivating. 

 

2.6.3 Methodology of swimming teaching in the elementary school 

In the context of adaptation to water environment, the following points were found as key 

aspects in the teaching methodology: entry in the water, tasks that help increasing confidence 

in the water, body balance and breathing control. These results seem to be in line with the 

opinion about the purpose of swimming practice during the elementary school (see table 7 

above). In fact, the pleasure of practicing such activity and the feeling of having no fear in 

water are key aspects for the inquired teachers. However, the fact that the inquired teachers 

have demonstrated they consider less important the body rotations in different axis (61% of 

answers are “sometimes” and 13% are “rarely”) seems to us to be inappropriate and not 

compliant with the opinion of several authors and publications in the domain of swimming, like 

for instance Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Barbosa and Queirós (2004), towards a good 

and complete acquisition of aquatic skills. In fact, several authors agree that the body rotation 

is an important target to learn more complex skills later on, like swimming strokes, starts and 



 

 

 

50 

turns (Barbosa &amp;amp; Queirós, 2004; Erbaugh, 1978; Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995;). The less 

importance given to rotations was also detected by Costa et al. (2012), in a similar study’s 

sample.  

With respect to the importance of content for the teaching of formal techniques/strokes, we 

can see that the most important topics for the inquired swimming teachers are the following: 

“water entry”, “dynamic balance”, “correct propulsion with legs” and “other specific technical 

skills”. As with the adaptation to water environment, the “symmetric body rotations” are 

consider to be less important skills. According to the inquired teachers, also less important are 

the “propulsion with arms”, the “rhythmic control of breathing”, “starts and turns” and other 

“complex skills”. Unfortunately, with this study we cannot determinate if the importance level 

given to each topic, during the teaching of swimming, has brought a positive or negative impact 

to the learning of the skill.  

 

2.7 Conclusion 

The results of this study indicate that the swimming practice, in the elementary school in 

Portugal, preferably follows the guidelines from the Ministry of Education. The absence of 

swimming practice in the school program of certain municipalities seems to be caused by 

budgetary and transportation restrictions. The methodology and supervision of swimming 

lessons are mainly accomplished by swimming school pedagogical coordinators. The application 

of defined aquatic programs are found, almost exclusively, in the third and fourth school 

years/levels, with only a session per week and organized in classes with inadequate size, 

considering the level of aquatic skills of students. Swimming education seems to be focused on 

the pleasure part of swimming practice, trying to make kids confidant with the water 

environment, drawing more attention to the acquisition of basic aquatic skills, such as the 

water entry, the body balance and the breathing control, with little use of didactic equipment.  

We recommend that futures studies should try to clarify the impact of certain topics related to 

teaching methodology, like class size, number of sessions per week, the teaching approach or 

even the use of auxiliary/didactic equipment, on the success of swimming education. It would 

be also very important to know the impact of swimming practice on the global motor 

development of children, besides its importance in the context of child safety.

Chapter III: The acquisition of aquatic 

skills in preschool children 

3.1 Content 

This chapter presents the analysis of the aquatic skills acquired during two equivalent programs, 

one conducted in shallow water and the other in deep water. 

 

3.2 Summary 

This study aimed to analyze changes of basic aquatic skills after six months of swimming 

practice. Twenty-one Portuguese school-aged children of both genders (4.70 ± 0.51 yr), 

inexperienced in aquatic programs, and participated in this study. The children were divided 

into two groups performing a similar aquatic program but on a different water depth: shallow 

water (n=10) and deep water (n=11). Each participant was evaluated twice for their aquatic 

readiness using an observation check list of 17 aquatic motor skills: during the first session (T0) 

and after six months of practice (two sessions per week - 48 sessions) (T1). The aquatic 

proficiency on each skill was compared between the groups and a stepwise discriminant analysis 

was conducted to predict the conditions with higher or lower aquatic competence. Results 

suggested that swimming practice contributed positively to improvements on several basic 

aquatic skills, in both groups. Though, the results showed that shallow water group managed 

to acquire a higher degree of aquatic competence particularly in five basic aquatic skills 

(p&lt;0.05): breath control - face immersion and eye opening; horizontal buoyancy; body position 

at ventral gliding; body position at dorsal gliding; leg kick with breath control at ventral body 

position, without any flutter device. The discriminant function revealed a significant 

association between both groups and four included factors (aquatic skills) (p&lt;0.001), accounting 

for (0.938)^2=88% between group variability. The body position at ventral gliding was the main 

relevant predictor (r=0.535). In conclusion, our results suggested that shallow water swimming 

lessons seemed to allow greater aquatic competence in preschool children after a period of six 

months of practice. 

Keywords: swimming, children, aquatic skills, shallow water, deep water 

 

3.3 Introduction 

Swimming is not considered a static personal ability (Langendorfer, 2014); instead, it implies 

an acquisition process, through practice and experience, which is built on a previous state of 



 

 

 

56 

autonomy, confidence and satisfaction in the aquatic environment. Hence, aquatic competence 

is considered a bio-behavioral assumption of learning more complex and specialized aquatic 

skills, which also includes swimming strokes (Parker &amp;amp; Blanksby, 1997; Warda, 2003).  

This conceptual understanding of aquatic competence is perhaps the most important in recent 

decades with regard to swimming learning (Barbosa &amp;amp; Queirós, 2004; Barbosa et al., 2010; 

Barbosa et al., 2013; Langerdorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995; Moreno et al., 1998). It provided a coherent 

pedagogical foundation to reshape the "thinking processes of teachers” and therefore on what 

is tough and how is tough (Clark &amp;amp; Peterson, 1986). However, there are still several pedagogical 

issues unanswered mainly related with the process of swimming teaching and its results.  

The uniqueness of the practice environment makes swimming a challenge for initiation of a 

constructive approach to teaching (Light &amp;amp; Wallian, 2008). Although constructivism is not a 

prescription for teaching (Fosnot, 1996), it is necessary to consider the teacher’s role to provide 

optimal opportunities for learning. Therefore, proper environment conditions in a swimming 

pool can be particular crucial to learning with effectiveness (Carvalho, 1994). One determinant 

factor seems to be the variation of the water depth (Costa et al., 2012). Indeed, aquatic 

readiness programs for young children can be performed in shallow water (usually from 0.65 to 

1.00 meter deep), usually in the beginning of the process, or in deep water (usually from 1.00 

meter to 2.00 meters deep), in the later stages. By decision of the swimming instructor or mere 

lack of structural alternatively, there are aquatic programs for children (for utilitarian or formal 

educational purposes) almost exclusively conducted in deep water. One of the few studies on 

this subject compared the deep and shallow water effect on developing preschooler’s aquatic 

skills, after six, twelve and eighteen months of practice (Costa et al., 2012). Results suggested 

that water depth might affect the purchase of some basic aquatic skills, at least up to six 

months of practice. However, that was a cross-sectional study, observational, which does not 

provide definitive information on the cause-effect of the conditions compared. 

Therefore, the purpose of our study was to analyze the differences on developing preschooler’s 

aquatic skills between deep and shallow water aquatic programs after six months of practice. 

It is known that the shallow water program (while applying a controlled methodological 

approach) may induce an acquisition of basic aquatic skills at a higher level of proficiency. 

 

3.4 Methods 

3.4.1 Study sample 

The study sample consisted on 21 Portuguese elementary school-aged children of both genders 

(4.70 ± 0.51 yr) with no previous experience in aquatic programs. The children were divided 

into two distinct classes with a similar aquatic program but performed on a different water 

depth environment: ten and 11 children performed all the swimming lessons in shallow water 

and deep water, respectively.  



 

 

 

57 

The local swimming school board and the Ethics Committee of the Health Sciences Faculty of 

the University of Beira Interior approved the experimental procedures, ensuring compliance 

with the declaration of Helsinki. The children's parents were informed about the study design 

and procedures and a written informed consent was signed. Data confidentiality was 

guaranteed, as well as their anonymity during the treatment process and analysis. 

 

3.4.2 Aquatic readiness assessment 

All children were evaluated twice for their aquatic readiness using an observation checklist of 

17 aquatic motor skills based on Langerdorfer and Bruya (1995) and already applied by Costa 

et al. (2012): during the first session (T0) and after six months of practice (two sessions per 

week: 48 sessions; T1). The aquatic motor skills assessed were the following: water entry (Sk1); 

water orientation and adjustment at vertical position (Sk2); breath control - immersion of the 

face and eye opening (Sk3) ; horizontal buoyancy (Sk4); body position at ventral gliding (Sk5); 

body position at dorsal gliding (Sk6); body position at longitudinal rotation in gliding (Sk7); body 

position at front and back somersaults (Sk8); leg kick with breath control at ventral body 

position, with flutter boards (Sk9); and without any flutter device, (Sk10); leg kick with breath 

control at dorsal body position with flutter boards (Sk11); and without any flutter device (Sk12); 

feet-first entry (Sk13); head-first entry (Sk14); Autonomous in deep pool (legs and arms 

displacement) (Sk15); vertical buoyancy at deep water (Sk16); deep water immersion (Sk17). 

Each one of these skills was divided into increasing levels of complexity (three, four or five 

levels, depending on the categorical skill) as suggested by Langendorfer and Bruya (1995): 

enable to perform at stage one, rudimentary movements at stage two (or three) and 

fundamental movements at stage three (or even four or five) that precede the specific motor 

skill acquisition. The children had three attempts to achieve the proposed exercises, as 

conducted by Costa et al. (2012). 

 

3.4.3 Swimming practice 

 At the beginning of the study all children were in a state of total inaptness to the aquatic 

environment. The swimming sessions took place at the same time of the day, twice a week, 

with 45 min duration (between 6h45 and 7h30 pm). The shallow water sessions were carried 

out in a 0.70 cm water depth, with the water temperature at 31 ºC, the air temperature at 29 

ºC and a relative humidity of 65%. The deep water sessions occurred in a 1.30 meter water 

depth, with a water temperature of temperature 29ºC, air temperature of 29°C and a relative 

humidity was 65%.  

Both aquatic programs aimed to improve children’s aquatic readiness by teaching basic aquatic 

skills. The number of students in each class was reduced to increase the useful time of the 

lesson and minimize practice waiting time among students. The swimming teacher was the 



 

 

 

58 

same in both groups. Therefore, the teaching methods and the skills developed in each class 

were similar and based on the literature guidelines (e.g., Langendorfer and Bruya, 1995 and 

Canossa et al. 2007). 

Table 11 shows how the aquatic skills were sequenced over the six months of teaching.

Teaching style shifted from absolute control (command and task style) to more indirect 

teaching style, best known as guided discovery (Mosston and Ashworth, 1990). Indeed, the 

students mostly performed analytical tasks to development basic aquatics skills in both aquatic 

environments. However, ludic tasks were also included, leading the child to discover a 

predetermined “aquatic motor target” in response to a sequence of problems presented by the 

teacher. Sometimes it was necessary to adjust certain aquatic tasks due to physical 

embarrassment imposed by depth. As such, we had to make minor changes to the task 

organization (i.e., smaller groups and slight changes to certain rules of play) and use some 



 

 

 

59 

floating didactic material. The following didactic and floating material was used: didactic - 

puzzles, towers, slides, mattresses, overflow arches, rings; floating - arches, balls, small boards 

and noodles. 

 

3.4.4 Statistical analysis 

Standard statistical methods were used for the calculation of means and standard deviations. 

The t test was used to compare the differences in aquatic proficiency (on each skill) between 

groups. The effect size was calculated using Cohen's d (Cohen, 1988). A stepwise discriminant 

analysis was also conducted with ? wilk’s method to build a predictive model for group 

membership (aquatic competence for shallow and deep water students). Predictor variables 

were the 17 aquatic motor skills previously described. Box's M variance-covariance matrices 

were used to test the multivariate homogeneity. The level of statistical significance was set at 

p ? 0.05. 

 

3.5 Results 

Table 12 presents the aquatic skills acquired by shallow water and deep water students during 

six months of practice.  

At the beginning of this study (T0), no differences were found in aquatic readiness between 

shallow and deep water. The students were not adapted to the aquatic environment and their 

aquatic motor proficiency was zero in all aquatic skills. After six months of practice there were 

differences between the means of both groups in five aquatic skills: Sk3, Sk4, Sk5 Sk6 and Sk10.  

The stepwise discriminant analysis was used to determine which aquatic skills discriminate 

between both groups after six months of practice. The step-by-step model of discrimination 

was built with four steps, including the following aquatic skills: Sk5 (F=40.151, p&lt;0.001); Sk16 

(F=34.254, p&lt;0.001); Sk15 (F=29.237, p&lt;0.001) and Sk13 (F=29.489, p&lt;0.001). The canonical 

discriminant function analysis revealed a significant association between both groups and all 

included factors, accounting for (0.938)^2=88% between group variability (?=0.119, 

Qui^2=36.124, p&lt;0.001).

3.6 Discussion 

The current study aimed to analyze the development of basic aquatic skills and to compare the 

effect of swimming practices in two distinct swimming pool environments (deep and shallow 

swimming pools). Results showed positive effects of swimming practice in children’s aquatic 

competence from both sessions’ types. However, shallow water students managed to acquire 

greater aquatic competence in nearly all aquatic skills measured after six months of practice.  

The swimming programs were more than just the simple acquisition of new motor patterns that 

allow moving inside the aquatic environment (Langendorfer &amp;amp; Bruya, 1995; Martins et al., 

2010). These are based on the need to adjust the motor behavior of the child in the water, 

helping to understand the particularities of the aquatic environment, specifically the lower 

gravity and viscosity (Barbosa &amp;amp; Queirós, 2004; Holmér, 1974). Therefore, the enjoyment for 

swimming practice is associated with the notion of trust about their own security in the new 

environment (Brenner, Saluja &amp;amp; Smith, 2003; Velasco, 1994).  

In the initial phase, the confidence of the child in the aquatic environment could be easily 

affected when, for instance, the water depth of exercitation is changed. This constrain caused 

by the depth of the pool could influence their autonomy. The current study didn’t have the 

purpose to study the variability of the pedagogic intervention or of the student´s motor 

behavior in both pool environments (see Costa et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it is our perception 

that the water depth seems to be an inhibitory factor to discover the aquatic environment and 

it´s particularities. Thus, the water depth could condition the students’ creativity in the 

resolution of major motor problems caused by the aquatic environment, at least in the early 

stages of familiarization. Although our effort to provide identical pedagogic experiences in both 

environments, for safety reasons it is understandable that teaching in deep water could be less

student-centered. There is a need to adapt the swimming tasks due to the mandatory use of 

float materials and the lack of confidence of the student. Therefore, the teaching methods in 

this condition tended to be more traditional (Mosston, 1992). This occurs at least in the initial 

phase of development, in which the students’ actions are always derived from the teacher 

decisions (Quina, 2009). Considering a complete understanding of the concept of aquatic 

competence, it is not imperative that there is only one response to similar situations (Moreno 

&amp;amp; Guitiérrez 1998; Moreno &amp;amp; Murcia, 1998). Thus, we believe that different water depths during 

swimming lessons inevitably provide different psychomotor experiences. Our results, as we 

discuss below, seem to support such reasoning.  

As reported in table 12, those children who attended to shallow water lessons presented greater 

level of aquatic competence in several skills, namely: breath control - immersion of the face 

and eye opening (Sk3), horizontal buoyancy (Sk4), body position at ventral gliding (Sk5), body 

position at dorsal gliding (SK6), and leg kick with breath control at ventral body position, 

without any flutter device (Sk10). These results are consistent with the data reported by Costa 

et al. (2012); although these authors reported differences between both session types after six 

months of practices also in the following skills: water entry (Sk1); body position at longitudinal 

rotation in gliding (Sk7); body position at front and back somersaults (Sk8); leg kick with breath 

control at ventral body position, with flutter boards (Sk9); leg kick with breath control at dorsal 

body position with flutter boards (Sk11); and without any flutter device (Sk12); feet-first entry 

(Sk13); head-first entry (Sk14); vertical buoyancy at deep water (Sk16); deep water immersion 

(Sk17). These substantial differences in the acquired aquatic competence as reported by Costa 

et al. (2012) can derive from the variability of the teaching intervention, given that teachers 

were not the same in both sessions’ types.  

The discriminant analysis showed that the Sk5 was the main predictor with significant 

correlation within function, consistent with the data reported by Costa et al. (2012). This could 

be related with the lower opportunity to develop the glide in ventral/dorsal position and in 

different depths in the early learning stages in deep water condition. Probably, the use of 

floating devices caused some changes in the horizontal position and an unreal sense of buoyancy 

(Blanksby et al., 1995, Langerdorfer, 1987).  

Our results showed that six months of practices in both conditions allowed students to develop 

the aquatic readiness of the majority of the aquatic basic skills, with exception to body position 

at front and back somersaults (SK8), which is in accordance with the results presented by Costa 

et al. (2012). Moreover, the body position at longitudinal rotation in gliding (Sk7) was nearly 

learned in both conditions probably because it is an aquatic motor skill conditioned by the 

previous acquisition of other basic skills, as the water entry, glide, respiration and static 

vertical balance in deep water (Barbosa &amp;amp; Queirós, 2004). It would be also important to refer 

that six months of practice in both swimming pool environments were not sufficient to achieve 

mastery on all aquatic skills. Similar data have been reported by Costa et al. (2012) after six 

and 12 months of aquatic practice.  



 

 

 

63 

Despite the importance of the results presented to the scientific and technical community, 

some limitations should be addressed to the current study. Firstly, it was only possible to access 

the aquatic competence of the students after six months of practice, ensuring the inclusion 

criterion of keeping the same teacher. Also, the limitation with regard to the size of the sample 

observed, conditioning the conclusions and the extrapolation of the results to other subjects. 

The effect size was used to better control and analyze the differences obtained. Thirdly, no 

data about the activity time devoted to swimming practice in both session types. Although the 

number of students has been reduced to enable high activity time in both sessions, we recognize 

that differences regarding this variable may exist. Future studies should assess the variation of 

activity time regarding to different learning contexts, number of students and teaching styles. 

Future studies should also seek to analyze the effectiveness of concurrent water depth 

environments programs (shallow and deep water) and the question of timing and dosing of 

swimming practice. 

 

3.7 Conclusions 

In conclusion, the present study suggests that a shallow water environment is more suitable for 

the development of basic aquatic skills in preschool children. The stepwise discriminant analysis 

revealed a significant association between both session types and four included aquatic skills 

for six months of practice; the body position at ventral gliding seems to be the main significant 

predictor. This could mean that aquatic skills at the children beginner’s level should be learnt 

in a shallow water swimming pool and deep water programs should be carefully planned to 

stimulate certain skills (i.e. body gliding) that seems to be differently exercised in both pool 

environments.

Chapter IV: Influence of a regular soccer 

or swimming practice on gross motor 

development in childhood 

4.1 Content 

This chapter presents the analysis of the short term, midterm and long term effects in the 

child’s global motor development brought by the practice of swimming and football, during 

childhood. 

 

4.2 Summary 

The objective of this study is to analyze the changes on global motor development after five 

(T5), ten (T10) and 30 (T30) months of swimming and soccer practice. The study’s sample 

consists of 33 preschool-aged boys: 11 children were soccer practitioners; 11 children were 

swimming practitioners; 11 children were controls. The Test of Gross Motor Development–

Second Edition (TGMD-2) was used to assess common gross motor skills [locomotion (LC), object 

control skills (OC)]. Both groups improved significantly in their gross motor quotient and the 

standard scores for LC and OC between T5 and T10. At T10, all soccer practitioners have already 

reached the maximum descriptive rating for the gross motor quotient (GMQ). Between T10 and 

T30, swimming practitioners were able to improve the standard scores for OC. Main results 

showed a positive impact of swimming and soccer participation in motor proficiency. 

Keywords: Swimming; soccer; motor development; childhood.  

 

4.3 Introduction 

Childhood is a key phase in the lifetime of a human being for the development of physical skills 

and fundamental psychomotor acquisition, which will allow, further on, the acquisition of a set 

of skills to influence the development of more complex motor skills (Gabbard, 2000). 

The gross motor development is the qualitative and quantitative progress in the motor skills, 

during lifetime (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005). The life experience of children and the stimulation 

they have received represent the baseline for the acquisition of more specific and critical motor 

skills for the different sport activities (Barnett &amp;amp; Okely, 2010; Clark &amp;amp; Metcalfe, 2002; Hands, 

Larkin, Parker, Straker &amp;amp; Perry, 2009; Lubans, Morgan, Cliff, Robinson &amp;amp; Goodway, 2009).  



 

 

 

68 

The phase between three and ten years old is considered to be the critical period in the path 

of gross motor development and, after that, there’s a period of maturity to the acquired motor 

skills. Gallahue and Ozmun (2005) state that the inexistence of a rich and diverse experience 

of physical movements may compromise the learning of perceptive, motor and cognitive skills.  

During childhood, several important development changes take place, being well established 

the positive influence of physical activity for a healthy growth (Boreham &amp;amp; Riddoch, 2001; 

Eisenmann, 2003; Malina, 2007; Steele, Brage, Corder, Wareham &amp;amp; Ekelund, 2008). Motor 

proficiency has been related with subsequent physical activity (Barnett et al., 2009; Kambas et 

al., 2012). However, physical activity leads to the development of fundamental motor skills 

(FMS) (Smith et al., 2014), including in children with coordinative difficulties (Kane &amp;amp; Staples, 

2014). Therefore, the literature seems to assume the existence of a strong synergistic 

relationship between physical activity and motor development. 

In this particular context, it should be also noted that the development towards specialized 

motor proficiency depends on relevant previous motor experiences in a safe age-appropriate, 

stimulating environment (Magill, 2000; Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005). Thus, low or inadequate 

motor stimulation would affect not only the child's motor development (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 

2005; Williams, et al., 2008), but also his cognitive, affective and social state (Sibley &amp;amp; Etnier, 

2003; Busseri, Rose-Krasnor, Willoughby, &amp;amp; Chalmers, 2006). Likewise, it is assumed that poor 

gross motor development will inhibit children from regular physical activities (e.g., Stodden et 

al., 2008; Williams et al., 2008). In the long run, this may also determine a greater likelihood 

of becoming sedentary in adulthood (Huotari, Nupponen, Mikkelsson, Laakso, &amp;amp; Kujala, 2011). 

For that reason, we should consider the assumption that childhood isn't only a critical period 

for the acquisition of fundamental motor skills, but also to ensure lifelong participation in sport 

(Stodden et al., 2008; Barnett et al., 2009).  

Lubans et al., (2010) have studied the relationship between motor competence and health, 

comparing 21 different studies where they identified the relationship between fundamental 

motor skills and self-esteem, the perception of motor competence, muscular and 

cardiorespiratory capacity, body mass index, flexibility, physical activity and sedentary 

behavior. In general, those studies revealed a positive connection between fundamental motor 

skills and physical exercise, in children and teenagers, as well as a positive connection between 

fundamental motor skills and cardiorespiratory capacity. 

The period between five and ten years of age exhibits considerable improvement in general 

motor coordination, allowing the achievement of increasingly complex movements (Gallahue &amp;amp; 

Ozmun, 2005; Massa &amp;amp; Ré, 2010). During this period of fast neurological development and large 

neural plasticity, the child is able to understand the rules of sport and is able to participate in 

structured programs of sport initiation (Ré, 2011). Thus, active children often choose after-

school sport activities, among them swimming and soccer are the most popular sports in several 

countries. These sports enhance not only motor skills but also physical abilities – but little is 

known about the effects on gross motor development. 



 

 

 

69 

Despite the fact that aquatic programs can differ (Jorgensen, 2012), the teaching methodology 

usually seeks to introduce children to basic aquatic skills (Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005). Games 

and several other fun activities are often used as an appropriate methodological resource to 

achieve aquatic readiness (Rocha, Marinho, Ferreira, &amp;amp; Costa, 2014). Studies about the 

effectiveness of aquatic interventions on gross motor development are scarce. However, water 

sports appear to provide important stimulation of body perception, inducing a positive effect 

on abilities associated with apprehension and balance (Sigmundsson &amp;amp; Hopkins, 2010). A recent 

study suggested that children with prior participation in swimming programs (within the 

educational context) demonstrate an optimized motor development, on several gross motor 

skill tests, but particularly on object control skills (Martins et al.,2015).  

Regarding soccer, the pedagogical intervention values the development of individual skills 

(e.g., passing, dribbling, shooting and ball control), but also team effectiveness. Young players 

are encouraged to recognize the different game variables (e.g.: opponents, field and goalpost 

dimensions) and to assume a tactical collective behavior (Costa, Garganta, Greco, Mesquita &amp;amp; 

Maia, 2011). For that reason, contemporary soccer teaching models are supported in tactical 

principles (Holt, Strean, &amp;amp; Bengoechea, 2002). However, not enough is known about the 

effectiveness of the specific measures of soccer adopted in improving gross motor development. 

The literature has sought to determine the effects of community and school physical activities 

influence on children’s gross motor development. There are hardly any studies on structured 

programs of sport initiation. Furthermore, study designs included randomized controlled trials 

(using experimental and quasi-experimental designs) and mostly single group pre-post trials 

during short time scales (&amp;lt;six months).  

Gabbard (2000) indicates that the gross motor development is a process of permanent changes 

that occur in the motor behavior of an individual, since his conception to his death, as a result 

from the interaction between hereditary and environmental factors (Gabbard, 2000). The gross 

motor development is a continuous process in the long run, with bigger changes during the early 

years of life, in the childhood. Therefore, the practice of sport activity in a regular basis 

corresponds to a privileged occasion for the changes of the gross motor development, because 

it stimulates a higher development of fundamental motor skills, mainly locomotive and 

manipulative skills.  

As we see, it seems important to obtain a longitudinal perspective about the impact of specific 

sport interventions on motor proficiency particularly because some children unfortunately 

never benefit from any kind of structured physical activity (physical education at school) until 

ten years old. 

Thus, this paper aims to describe the longitudinal changes in the gross motor development after 

five, ten and thirty months of swimming or soccer practice. We expect that both sports 

interventions will play a catalytic role in gross motor development. However, we also anticipate 

differences in the level of acquisition and degree of mastery of some fundamental motor skills.

4.4 Method 

4.4.1 Participants 

This research used a convenience sample of young children that were available to participate 

in this study and who had a known history of swimming or soccer participation. The study sample 

consisted of 33 preschool-aged boys (4.8±0.5 yrs.), all residents on the metropolitan area of 

Lisbon (Portugal). At baseline, the following three groups were considered: 11 children (5.3±0.2 

yrs.) with no previous involvement in sports or any kind of structured physical activity (control 

group); 11 children (4.6±0.4 yrs.) were involved in swimming classes at a beginner level, with 

five months of practice (swimming group); 11 children (4.8±0.5 yrs.) were involved in soccer 

classes at a beginner level, with five months of practice (soccer group). Children with different 

history or sport experience (five months at baseline), in these or other structured exercise of 

programs, weren't included in this study. Similarly, all physical or psychological diseases that 

may have precluded ability to perform the requested training exercises and testing were 

considered exclusion criteria. 

The study included three different moments of assessment: baseline (T5), corresponding to five 

months of previous practice of swimming or soccer, respectively; after ten months of 

accumulated practice (T10) swimming or soccer, respectively; after thirty months of 

accumulated practice (T30) swimming or soccer, respectively. The longitudinal nature of this 

research did not allow an evaluation of the control group after the T10 moment; from this 

period onwards, most of the children included in this group started practicing sports. For 

obvious ethical reasons, researchers didn't inhibit children and/or guardians from being 

involved in sport. Similarly, we couldn't make any follow-up assessment beyond 30 months of 

practice. 

All experimental procedures and protocols were compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki and 

were approved in advance by the Data Protection Authority in Portugal (Comissão Nacional de 

Protecção de Dados), by the managers of local swimming and football schools involved in this 

study and by the Ethics Committee of the Health Sciences Faculty of the University of Beira 

Interior. Data confidentiality was guaranteed as well as participant’s anonymity. 

 

4.4.2 Gross motor development assessment 

The “test of gross motor development 2” (TGMD-2) [Ulrich, 2000] was used to assess children’s 

competence of fundamental motor skills in three distinct moments: after five (T5), ten (T10) 

and thirty (T30) months of sports practice. The TGMD-2 is a norm-referenced measure with a 

good psychometric quality to assess gross motor skills that develop early in life (Ulrich, 2000). 

It has been used by several researchers in different countries, including for longitudinal follow 

up (Cliff, Okely, Smith, &amp;amp; McKeen, 2009; Cliff, Wilson, Okely, Mickle, &amp;amp; Steele, 2007; 

Westendorp et al., 2014). It assesses twelve fundamental motor skills typically taught in 



 

 

 

71 

physical education to children aged from three to ten years old (Wiart &amp;amp; Darrah, 2001). Skills 

are divided into two subtests: Locomotion (run, gallop, hop, leap, horizontal jump, skip, and 

slide) and Object Control (two-handed strike, stationary bounce, catch, kick and the overhand 

throw).  Each skill defined by the TGMD-2 consists of components that together constitute 

mature performance of that skill. 

After a standard warm-up, each skill was performed three times and measured with three to 

four observable criteria based upon typical movement patterns identified from motor 

development literature and suggested by Ulrich (2000). Each criterion was rated as zero (the 

criterion is observed on fewer than two of the three trials) or one (criterion is observable on at 

least two of the three trials). The highest total raw score for both subtests is 48. Subtest raw 

scores were then converted to standard scores (ranging between one and 20) for both subtests, 

considering the child's age at the time. Subtest standard scores (locomotion and objected 

control) are then summed and converted to calculate each child´s gross motor development 

quotient.  

As proposed by the author (Ulrich, 2000), all participants repeated the TGMD-2 one week later 

(retest) in T5, T10 and in T30. All evaluations were conducted by two researchers familiar with 

the TGMD-2 battery, including the evaluation criteria for each fundamental motor skill. Even 

so, we performed several training sessions in our laboratory. One small pilot study was also 

conducted using a restricted sample of five children (4.9 ±0.5 years), not considered in the 

analysis. These five children were evaluated twice in a weekly timeframe. The intra-class 

correlation coefficients (as a measure of reliability) were very high for all measured skills 

(ranged from 0.80 to 1.00). 

All assessments were recorded on video (Sony camera, HDR-CX115 model) that was used only 

for the purpose of this study. The two observers analyzed the images obtained and reviewed 

the individual performance for each motor skill, according to the proposed criteria. Then, it 

was given an opportunity to discuss each performance and the respective score.  

Tests and retest were applied effectively in T5, T10 and T30, always under the same conditions 

(outdoor sport field), at the same time of day and with similar weather conditions (without 

rain, light breeze and on a mild air temperature). Participants wore shorts and t-shirts. 

 

4.4.3 Swimming and soccer practice 

Training sessions for swimming and soccer occurred at the same time, twice a week (between 

6h00 and 6h45 pm). In both sports the intervention program was elementary, following mostly 

a mixed pedagogical concept using games to incite children to engage into learning activities 

but also some individual analytical motor tasks. 

Swimming lessons were carried out in deep pool (plus than 1.30m) with a water temperature 

of 31.5ºC (the air temperature was 29°C±1 and the relative humidity was 65%). The aquatic 



 

 

 

72 

program aimed to improve children’s aquatic readiness by teaching basic aquatic fundamental 

skills. At the beginning of the study all children were in a state of total inaptness to the aquatic 

environment with no ability to perform intended propelling actions. The pedagogical 

intervention was based on Langendorfer and Bruya (1995) and Canossa et al., (2007). The 

following aquatic motor skills were developed: water entry; water orientation and adjustment 

at vertical position; breath control - immersion of the face and eye opening; horizontal 

buoyancy; body position at ventral gliding; body position at dorsal gliding; body position at 

longitudinal rotation in gliding; body position at front and back somersaults; leg kick with 

breath control at ventral body position, with flutter boards and without any flutter device; leg 

kick with breath control at dorsal body position with flutter boards and without any flutter 

device; feet-first and head-first entry; autonomous in deep pool (legs and arms displacement); 

vertical buoyancy at deep water and deep-water immersion.  

The soccer practice was conducted in the outdoor school sports field with synthetic grass. The 

sessions were planned following a coherent pedagogical approach with the latest models of 

soccer teaching (e.g., Bunkerm &amp;amp; Thorpe, 1982; Costa et al., 2011; Holt, Strean, &amp;amp; Bengoechea, 

2002). Throughout the soccer study teaching program sought to develop three major 

capabilities: the ability to select appropriate solutions before different game problems 

(decision making); the ability to perform effectively (technical training to enhance dribbling, 

passing, shooting, finishing and also the weak foot for youth soccer players) and the ability to 

play as a team (communicate and cooperate). Hence, children’s specific technical skills were 

developed (mastery of body movement with/without the ball) but also their tactical awareness. 

Training sessions for swimming and soccer occurred at the same time, twice a week (between 

6h00pm and 6h45pm). In both sports, the intervention program was elementary, following 

mostly a mixed pedagogical concept using games to incite children to engage into learning 

activities, but also some individual analytical motor tasks. 

 

4.4.4 Analysis 

Descriptive statistics were the mean and standard deviation. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was 

used to evaluate the normality of the distribution of the variables. The Mann-Whitney U test 

was used to compare differences between two independent groups. Kruskal-Walli?s test was 

used for multiple group comparisons. The intra-group difference between assessment moments 

was tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank-sum test. The analyses were adjusted using the 

Holm’s sequential Bonferroni correction (Holm, 1979); according to this sequential multiple 

test procedure, the adjusted p-value for n paired comparisons is: pBonferroni C = (C ? i + 1) × 

p; where C correspond to number of comparisons and i rank of the pair in terms of degree of 

significance. The nonparametric effect size was obtained from the following equation 

(Rosenthal, 1994): r = Z/?N. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used as a measure 



 

 

 

73 

of consistency of ratings over time. To establish statistical significance, a p?.05 criterion was 

used. All data were analyzed using the software SPSS 22.0. 

 

4.5 Results 

Table 14 presents the subtests scores (raw and standard scores) and the gross motor quotient 

for all groups and assessment moments separately. Both experimental groups showed 

significant improvements between T5 and T10 in the gross motor quotient and in the standard 

scores of both subtests. The control group shows no significant improvement in this regard. 

Significant differences were found (p&gt;0.05) between groups at T5, T10 and T30 for the object 

control standard score and also for the gross motor quotient. Inter-group differences were also 

found between swimmers and soccer practitioners for the locomotor standard score (at T10, 

p=0.009, r=0.79), for the object control standard score (T5, p=0.022, r=0.69; T10, p=0.000, 

r=1.11; T30, p=0.014, r=0.74) and for the gross motor quotient (T10, p=0.001, r=1.04; T30, 

p=0.022, r=0.69).

Note. All p-values were corrected according to the Holm-Bonferroni procedure. (a) = significant (p&lt;0.05) 
differences in motor proficiency between groups; (b) = significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in motor 
proficiency between swimmers and soccer players; (N.S.) = not significant; (¥) = ICC was not calculated 
because one of the component variable has zero variance and is removed from the scale. 

 

Table 15, presents the distribution of descriptive ratings for the gross motor quotient by each 

group and assessment moment. Following what already mentioned, these data showed a 

distribution of participants that tends to higher levels of motor development among swimmers, 

but particularly in soccer practitioners. In fact, at T10 and T30, most participants (swimmers 

and soccer practitioners) were ranked above average levels.

Table 16 presents the results for each locomotor fundamental skill for all groups and evaluation 

moments separately. Between T5 and T10, one can note significant improvements (p&lt;0.05) in 

running proficiency, in control participants. During this period, the soccer practitioners 

improved significantly their standard scores in hopping. In turn, the swimmers showed 

improvements (p&lt;0.05) in running, galloping and hopping but not in leaping, horizontal jumping 

and sliding. Between T10 and T30, soccer players showed no significant improvements in these 

skills. Within a longer range (T5 versus T30), swimmers were able to improve their motor 

proficiency in running, galloping and hopping. As for the soccer players, locomotor skills 

improved significantly (p&lt;0.05) between T5 and T30 only for hopping. At T5, the inter-group 

comparison showed no significant differences between groups in these skills. However, groups 

differ from each other in T10 (p&amp;lt;0.05) in almost all locomotor skills, being the group of soccer 

practitioners more proficient (p&amp;lt;0.05) than swimmers in hop (p =0.47, r=0.68). After 30 months 

of sport practice, no significant differences (p &gt;0.05) were found between both experimental 

groups.

Table 17 shows the mean and standard deviations raw and standard scores for each object 

control fundamental skill, for all groups and evaluation moments. Following the trend observed 

in the locomotor subtest, between T5 and T10 the control group didn’t show any significant 

variations in these object control skills. During this period, soccer players show proficiency 

increases on most evaluated fundamental skills, except in underhand roll and catch (the 

proficiency level in T5 for the catch skill was already maximum). However, the swimmers were 

able to improve their motor proficiency in striking a stationary ball, in stationary dribble and 

also in underhand roll. Between T10 and T30, no significant variations were identified in soccer 

player’s motor proficiency for any object control skills, due to the high level already achieved 

in T10. In turn, the swimmers showed a significant evolution in almost all the skills tested during 

this period. In a long-term perspective (T5 vs. T30), both experimental groups show significant 

improvements in most object control skills. At T5 and T10, significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were 

found between groups, in most object control skills, except for striking a stationary ball (T5 

and T10) and for overhand throw (T5). Actually, at T5 and T10 the group of soccer practitioners 

were even more proficient than swimmers in stationary dribble (T5, p=0.021, r=0.69; T10, 

p=0.002, r=0.95), catch (T5, p=0.002, r=0.95; T10, p=0.002, r=0.93), kick (T5, p=0.010, r=0.78; 

T10, p=0.002, r=0.92) and underhand roll (T5, p=0.001, r=1.05). At T30, following the trend of 



 

 

 

76 

the previous subset, no significant differences were found between the practitioners of 

swimming and soccer.

4.6 Discussion 

This study sought to describe the longitudinal changes in motor development resulting from 

swimming and soccer practice during childhood. In general, our results showed a positive 

impact of these two sports participation in motor proficiency.  

Assuming development as a dynamic system, different practice opportunities and even small 

differences in beginning states can amplify and lead to large individual differences in motor 

development (Smith &amp;amp; Thelen, 2003). So, motor performance seems notably fragile and context 

dependent. This is an important reason why we should understand the processes by which sports 

activities are influenced, leading to changes on a longer time-scale. This research aims to 

contribute to this particular need, enabled us to obtain a more systematic view of the effect 

of sports practice over time.  



 

 

 

77 

First, we want to point out that even in a context of lack of sports participation (control group), 

five months (between T5 and T10) were sufficient to induce a significant impact on running 

ability (p=0.039). This seems consistent with the qualitative changes that often follows the 

body size growth, leading to increased levels of strength and coordination that inherently 

improve running performance (Haywood &amp;amp; Getchell, 2004). Indeed, raw scores for five, six and 

seven years old children are expected to increase significantly with age (Afonso et al., 2009; 

Aponte, French, &amp;amp; Sherrill, 1990; Ulrich, 2000). However, five months were not enough to 

identify significant variations in the other eleven fundamental motor skills that seem more 

stable over the times. In fact, our results showed no significant decreases in the raw score 

means for various skills, including the standard score mean for the object control subtest (see 

table 14). Although we have controlled the participation in sportive activities, the 

circumstances and the peculiarities of the children’s play weren't assessed. We recognize that 

this can, eventually, influence the results, just like the majority of the studies in this area. 

Nevertheless, it seems justified to note that the expected evolution in motor development with 

age isn't merely dependent on the children’s growth and maturation, but is also highly 

influenced by environmental conditions (different practice opportunities) and suitability of the 

motor stimulation (e.g., Gallahue &amp;amp; Ozmun, 2005; Clark, 2007). 

The fast evolution of motor proficiency in the first few months of sport participation (between 

T5 and T10) seems to be another important point to note in our results. Indeed, both 

experimental groups showed significant improvements between five and ten months of practice 

in locomotor and object control raw scores and also in the gross motor development quotient 

(see table 14). Between T10 and T30, motor proficiency is clearly less improved in both 

practitioners, but particularly in soccer practitioners. This is due to the fact that they have 

reached near maximum levels of proficiency in several fundamental motor skills at T10. In fact, 

we found that all soccer practitioners reach a “very superior” descriptive rate for the gross 

motor development in T10. The TGMD-2 battery has a high degree of reliability and low-test 

error (Wiart &amp;amp; Darrah, 2001), but it seems to have little sensitivity to age-related improvements 

in participants with high or maximum motor development levels. In our opinion, this seems to 

be the most plausible reason for the decrease in both subtest standard scores (and also in the 

gross motor quotient), between T10 and T30, when the raw score in most fundamental motor 

skills increases and reaches maximum values (or nearly that). This score limitation at the top 

of a scale is commonly termed “ceiling effect” (Wang, Zhang, McArdle &amp;amp; Salthouse, 2009). 

The inter-group differences in motor proficiency are also an important outcome that should be 

highlighted. The results show inter-group differences that are more evident for object control 

skills in T5 and for locomotion skills in T10. This seems to mean that object control skills are 

more sensitive to the effects of soccer practice than actually locomotion skills, at least in these 

ages. In fact, in T5 no differences in locomotion skills were noticed between groups. Despite 

the difficulty in comparing these results due to lack of studies about this subject, the 

interpretation appears to be related to the comparability of training stimulation in interaction 



 

 

 

78 

with biological factors (Malina &amp;amp; Bouchard, 2001). The object control skills are clearly 

developed through stimulation that requires different levels of organization (e.g.: two or more 

children to play and different forms of playing), and objects availability. In turn, locomotor 

skills tend to be held more trivially, spontaneously and less dependent on environment and 

gender differences. For that reason, the locomotion subtest raw scores are converted into 

standard scores, regardless of gender, and the same isn’t true for the object control skills.  

The results regarding the continued evolution in object control proficiency in swimmers seem 

consistent with the data presented by Martins et al. (2015). These authors showed that previous 

swimming practice seems to induce a positive effect on several gross motor skills, but 

particularly on objects control skills. Games are used, mainly, as a natural methodological 

approach to teach aquatic readiness, because they combine both motivation and educational 

effectiveness and often the handling of several teaching materials for specific recreational 

purposes (Rocha et. al., 2014).  

Notwithstanding, for the relevance of the present results, this study has several limitations. 

First, no information about the children’s play habits and/or objectively measured physical 

activity levels and patterns were available; these data would be very helpful in explaining the 

results, namely the motor proficiency increases with age. Second, no follow-up assessments 

after a period of no sport-specific intervention were conducted; this would allow us to observe 

if these effects in motor proficiency are well founded. Third, no baseline data about the 

participant’s motor proficiency, before sport practice; this would be valuable to understand 

the initial (first five months) effects of the practice of both sports. We may also point to a 

fourth and final limitation that seems to arise by the lack of sensitivity of the TGMD-2 battery 

to discriminate improvements in children of high-level motor proficiency. Further research 

attention is needed to explore possible methods of dealing with this ceiling effect in TGMD-2 

longitudinal data. 

 

4.7 Conclusion 

In conclusion, the present study shows that sport practice during childhood seems to contribute 

to a higher motor development. Despite of the improved motor skill competence of soccer 

practitioners at short and long-term, swimming practitioners show an on-going motor 

development particularly on object control skills.

Chapter V: Overall conclusions, 

limitations and recommendations 

5.1 Conclusions 

In the first investigation topic in this thesis, we have proposed to describe the way the 

swimming teaching is implemented in the context of the Expression and Physical Motor 

Education discipline, in the elementary school, in Portugal. This was a descriptive research. 

With the results from that study we could find some deficiencies in the integration of swimming 

practice in the elementary school’s program and probably those are limitations of the efficiency 

of the teaching method adopted, in respect to the acquisition of more complex aquatic skills. 

Elementary schools with swimming practice in their educational program are doing it 

exclusively for students of the third and fourth level/year (in line with the indications from the 

Portuguese Ministry of Education), with weekly sessions and classes with too much students. 

The swimming sessions are used basically to develop basic aquatic skills and the will of 

practicing this sport, using some didactic material occasionally. In those elementary schools 

were swimming practice is out of school program, budget restrictions and difficulties to get 

transportation for students between school and swimming pool are reasons given to exclude 

swimming practice.   

The second investigation topic is related to the pedagogy of swimming. We have proposed to 

analyze the influence of an important variable of context – water depth – in the acquisition of 

basic aquatic skills by children. In that respect, the results have shown that we get a better 

performance in shallow water than in deep water, after six months of practice. We have found 

significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) between the sample groups, with respect to the motor 

proficiency of five aquatic skills: breath control, immersion of the face and eye opening (Sk3); 

horizontal buoyancy (Sk4); body position at ventral gliding (Sk5); body position at dorsal gliding 

(Sk6); leg kick with breath control at ventral body position, without any flutter device (Sk9). 

The body position during gliding was the main relevant predictor (r = 0.535). Therefore, it’s 

probably more suitable to teach swimming in shallow water, during the initial phase of practice. 

If we have access only to deep swimming pools, we suggest that the swimming teaching program 

should focus on developing the acquisition of aquatic skills that normally draw less attention 

from teachers, like gliding, for instance. 

The third as last investigation topic of this thesis is related to the motor development. With 

this study, we had the objective of knowing the importance of sports in the gross motor 

development, by describing the impact brought by the practice of swimming or soccer, in the 

short, mid and long term (five, ten and 30 months, respectively). The results indicate that 

sports during childhood have an important contribute to the gross motor development. Soccer 



 

 

 

84 

seems to have great influence on the motor development, because, after ten months of 

practice, soccer practitioners have achieved the highest proficiency levels in several 

fundamental motor skills (both at the locomotor level and object control). The impact of 

swimming practice on terrestrial fundamental motor skills is positive, contributing to a gradual 

motor development, especially in respect to skills of object control. 

 

5.2 Limitations and directions for future research 

This thesis has some relevant limitations. The critical observation of those limitations is not 

just desirable from a scientific accuracy perspective, but, above all, it will help opening the 

door for future research based on or in the sequence of the object of this thesis. 

In relation to the first study hereby presented, the major limitation is related to the size of the 

sample used. Although we have collected and analyzed the data from 30% of Portuguese 

municipalities, this data is not fully representative of the current situation nationwide.  

Because the major part of the inquired municipalities didn’t answer our survey, we weren’t 

able to get a wider perspective. The same has happened with the inquired teachers. Besides 

that, our study only presents descriptive data and there’s no records about the effectiveness 

of the swimming programs used, in the long run.  

For future research, we consider it’s very important to analyze the level of aquatic 

development of Portuguese children, in the school context. For child safety reasons, the follow-

up of aquatic development during childhood is not just relevant from a scientific perspective, 

but, most important, should be considered a social and political concern. It is also important 

to evaluate the effectiveness of the swimming teaching programs used. In the second and third 

years of elementary school, swimming is considered as an optional complementary activity 

(sport practice at school). The characteristics of that practice and, in particular, its connection 

to local entities, like swimming clubs and collectivities, should be taken as an important subject 

of future study in more detail, with the objective of developing the practice of swimming. 

The second study has three important constraints, as we have earlier mentioned: (i) the 

evaluation of the effectiveness of swimming teaching within a period of six months only, which 

is not enough to accurately assess its impact in the development of swimming skills of the 

practitioner, related to the context variable “depth level” (shallow water, deep water), in the 

long run; (ii) the small size of sample in both experimental groups; (iii) the lack of time control 

of motor involvement in both kind of session. This limitation is our strongest recommendation 

for future studies around this subject – lesson time control in the context of different kind of 

teaching and different methodologies, especially with programs using both depth options 

(shallow water and deep water – a very common practice, as we have demonstrated in the first 

study). We consider it is also very important to measure the influence of other variables in the 

effectiveness of swimming teaching: number of practitioners per class, number of sessions per 

week (intensive blocks vs. less intensive blocks), or the use the usage of didactic material. We 



 

 

 

85 

believe it is necessary to have a clearer understanding of the impact of different pedagogical 

approaches of swimming teaching in the motor, social and cognitive development of children, 

especially the richness of stimulations that we see in aquatic recreation programs. Finally, we 

think it is also important to point out that, although the teaching program used in both depth 

levels is identical, the development of swimming practice in deep water seems to have specific 

constraints, especially to beginners – the sense of unsafety (risk of drowning) is undoubtedly 

higher in deep water, which may represent an inhibition factor to children, with a critical 

influence in the development of basic aquatic skills, during the initial phase of swimming 

learning, which main objective is to make the child to be more confident in the aquatic 

environment. We haven’t evaluated the stress level resulted from a more “intensive” swimming 

learning context; this is, therefore, a relevant subject for future studies, especially the 

measure of the neuro-endocrine reaction before and after each swimming session and during 

the whole program.  

In respect to the last study, one of the major limitations is the lack of data about the ludic 

habits and the physical condition of children that have participated in the study. Such data 

would be very useful in having a clear understanding of the results achieved with this study, 

especially with regards to the motor proficiency, with the increasing age. The lack of data 

about the gross motor development in the initial phase of the swimming program (until five 

months of practice) represents another important constraint, although both experimental 

groups have initiated the program at the same time and with the same weekly frequency and 

duration. As we have mentioned earlier, we have faced some limitations in the TGMD-2 

evaluation program in identifying improvements of motor proficiency close or even above an 

advanced level. From our perspective, the solution for this issue is a good subject for future 

studies, exploring possible methods to overcome the “celling effect” in the TGMD-2 program, 

with longitudinal data. We also consider a very good subject for future studies the elaboration 

a clear set of factors to define the motor development during childhood, by combining physical 

aspects, contexts and opportunities of learning and stimulation programs. This will bring 

important guidance into the definition of school and non-school swimming programs. Given the 

fact that the motor development is qualitative, sequential and even cumulative, it would be 

very important to know better the relationship between the progress of motor proficiency in 

fundamental physical skills and the progress of the acquisition of specific skills in different 

sports, including swimming.
