RESUMO 

Materiais com poros interconectados são comumente usados em 
diversas aplicações de filtragem, como, por exemplo, purificação de 

água, filtração de metais fundidos e filtração de gases quentes. Se por 
um lado, os filtros devem conter uma estrutura de elevada porosidade 
aberta; em contrapartida, esses materiais devem apresentar resistência 

mecânica suficiente para suportar a queda de pressão durante o processo 
de filtração. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a viabilidade de 
produção de tubos porosos, em compósitos de matriz cerâmica e 

metálica reforçados por fibras, via extrusão termoplástica de pós, para 
aplicação em processos de filtração. A extrusão termoplástica é um 

processo contínuo, capaz de promover um alto nível de alinhamento de 
fibras na direção de extrusão, sem que haja excessiva fratura de fibras 
durante o processamento. Pós de alumina e superliga de níquel foram 

selecionados para formar a matriz dos compósitos de matriz cerâmica e 
metálica, respectivamente. Fibras curtas de alumina foram utilizadas 
como reforço. Como componentes do sistema ligante foram utilizados 

polietileno de baixa densidade (LDPE), parafina (PW) e ácido esteárico 
(SA). Diferentes proporções entre LDPE-PW-SA foram estudadas a fim 

de desenvolver um sistema ligante apropriado ao processo. A evolução 
da viscosidade da mistura em função do teor de sólidos foi estudada e 
comparada a diversos modelos de viscosidade. Após o desenvolvimento 

do feedstock de extrusão, 30 % em volume de fibras foram adicionadas 
a mistura. Tubos com 4,5 a 10,0 mm de diâmetro, com 0,6 e 1,0 mm de 
espessura foram então extrudados com sucesso, após sucessivas etapas 

de ajuste dos parâmetros de extrusão. Análises microscópicas 
confirmaram o alinhamento satisfatório das fibras. Finalmente, após a 
sinterização dos tubos a 1300 ºC durante 60 minutos, meso e 

macroporosidades foram identificadas através de análises porosimétricas 
por intrusão de mercúrio, totalizando um volume de poros de, 

aproximadamente, 41 e 36 % nos tubos de matriz cerâmica e metálica, 
respectivamente. O nível de porosidade, bem como o tamanho médio de 
poros, foi considerado adequado à aplicação em certos processos de 

filtração, em especial a filtração de gases quentes.

ABSTRACT 

Materials with interconnected pore network are commonly used in 
several filtering applications, e.g. water purification, molten metal 

filtration, and hot-gas filtration. On one hand filters must contain a 
highly open porous structure; on the other hand these materials must 
have sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the pressure drop 

during the filtration process. The objective of this work was to study the 
feasibility to produce short fiber reinforced porous ceramic and metal 
matrix composites tubes, processed by powder thermoplastic extrusion, 

for application in filtering processes. The powder thermoplastic 
extrusion is a continuous process, able to promote high alignment of 

fibers in the extrusion direction, without excessive fiber breakage. 
Alumina and nickel superalloy powders have been selected to form the 
matrix of the ceramic and metallic matrix composites, respectively. 

Short alumina fibers have been used as reinforcement. Low density 
polyethylene (LDPE), paraffin wax (PW) and stearic acid (SA) formed 
the binder system. Different proportions of LDPE-PW-SA have been 

studied in order to develop a binder system suitable for the extrusion 
process. The evolution of the feedstock viscosity as a function of the 

solids content was studied and compared to various viscosity models. 
After the development of the extrusion feedstock, 30 vol.% of fibers 
were incorporated to the mixture. Tubes with 4.5 and 10.0 mm of 

diameter, with 0.6 and 1.0 mm of thickness, were then successfully 
extruded, after the complete extrusion parameters adjustment. 
Microscopy analysis confirmed the satisfactory fiber alignment. Finally, 

after sintering the tubes at 1300 °C for 60 minutes, meso and 
macroporosity were identified by mercury intrusion porosimetry 
analysis, with a total pore volume of, approximately, 41 and 36 % in the 

ceramic and metal matrix composites, respectively. The porosity level, 
as well as the average pore size, have been considered adequate for the 

application in certain filtration processes, particularly in hot-gas 
filtration.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Porous materials, more specifically interconnected porous 
materials, are used in several applications, in particular filtering. 

Examples of filtering process are the water purification, oil filtration, 
aerosols filtration, hot-gas filtration and molten metal filtration 
(FERNANDO, et al., 2002; FERNANDO, et al., 2005; STUDART, et 

al., 2006). Filtration is a very important process for several fields, in 
particular for the petrochemical, mining and chemical industries 
(FERNANDO, et al., 2005). 

For its application to be successfully attended, a porous material 
used for filtering must fulfill the following requirements (DUO, et al., 

1999): 

i. Presence of an interconnected porous network; 
ii. Pore size distribution according to the size of the filtered 

particulate; 
iii. Permeability to the filtered fluid; 
iv. Sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the fluid 

pressure drop; 
v. Thermal resistance to withstand high temperatures, up to 

1000 °C, in the case of hot-gas filtration; 
vi. Corrosion and oxidation resistance. 

On one hand these materials must contain high open porosity, 
according to the application, on the other hand, high mechanical 

strength is also required for the component to withstand the pressure 
drop imposed by the filtering process. 

The introduction of short fibers is an intelligent solution to 

improve the mechanical strength, without jeopardizing the permeability 
of the component. In the search of appropriate materials for the 

production of porous components, short fibers were found to be good 
precursors for membranes used in hot-gas and aerosols filtration 
(FERNANDO, et al., 2005). 

One way to optimize the utilization of fibers is to align them in 
the direction of the highest tensile strain imposed to the component. It is 
well known that powder injection molding (PIM) and powder extrusion 

have the ability to align short fibers in the direction of the viscous flux 
of the material (CHAWLA, et al., 2006; YE, et al., 2008). The 



36 
 

alignment is parallel in contracting flow and perpendicular in expanding 

flow (YE, et al., 2008). The same benefit can be obtained by the powder 
thermoplastic extrusion. 

The fiber alignment achieved by extrusion processes is one of the 
reasons why this route was chosen to produce short fibers reinforced 
porous tubes. Furthermore this process shows other important 

advantages such as: 

i. Fiber length maintenance (fiber breaking occurs only 
during the mixing step); 

ii. Possibility to produce thin wall tubes without shape 
collapse; 

iii. It is a continuous process, which is a very important 
issue for industry in terms of time and process 
variability; 

iv. Possibility to produce components with a high 
length/thickness ratio. 

In the present work alumina short fibers were added to alumina 

powder and a nickel based alloy powder, to produce ceramic matrix 
composite (CMC) and metal matrix composite (MMC) porous tubes, 

respectively. The idea was to validate a process that could suit several 
different applications in which ceramic or metallic filters are required.

 610 alumina fibers were chosen due to purity and 

availability at the EMPA laboratory where this project was carried out. 
Alumina powder was chosen for its well known thermal and chemical 
stability, adequate for filtering applications (FERNANDO, et al., 2002). 

The IN718 nickel superalloy was chosen for its high thermal and 
corrosion resistance.

1.1. OBJECTIVES 

1.1.1. General objectives 

The aim of this work is to study the feasibility to produce short 

fiber reinforced porous CMCs and MMCs tubes, processed via powder 
thermoplastic extrusion. 

1.1.2. Specific objectives 

i. Development of a feedstock with tailored solids content 
and binder system, which is adequate for subsequent 
extrusion and debinding steps. The feedstock should be 

common for alumina and IN718 powders, not to double 
the amount of work necessary to achieve the further 

objectives; 
ii. Investigation of the influence of the fibers on feedstock 

mixing and debinding; 

iii. Investigation of the influence of cylinder temperature, 
die temperature and piston speed on the extrusion 
pressure and extrudate visual aspect; 

iv. Control of extrusion parameters in order to obtain defect-
free extruded tubes; 

v. Comparison of debinding behavior between disk shaped 
and tubular shaped samples; 

vi. Definition of a debinding route that is able to maintain 
tube geometry until sintering step; 

vii. Characterization of sintered MMC and CMC tubes 
regarding microstructure, porosity and crystalline phases.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 

2.1. COMPOSITES 

Composite materials comprise any material that has at least two 

chemically or physically distinct phases. The combination of the two 
different phases usually provides  a combination of properties that 
cannot be obtained by the components individually (CHAWLA, et al., 

2006). The continuous phase is the matrix, while the distributed phase is 
the reinforcement, which can be in the form of particles, whiskers, fibers 
or laminate (CHAWLA, 2003) as shown in Figure 1. 

 
Figure 1 – Classification of composites according to the reinforcement form. 
Source: Chawla (2003). 

Both matrix and reinforcement can be polymeric, ceramic or 
metallic. According to the matrix material is convenient to separate the 

composites into three groups: polymer matrix composites (PMC’s), 
ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and metal matrix composites 
(MMCs) (CHAWLA, 2003). 

Normally a composite performs its function as far as the fiber is 
loaded via fiber/matrix interface. Therefore the interface in composites 
has so much importance (MILEIKO, 1997). 

In a composite, there are two types of bonding at the interface of 
matrix and reinforcement, mechanical and chemical bonding. In PMC’s 
and MMCs it is important that both types of bonding are present, in a 



40 
 

way that the load can be transmitted from the weaker matrix to the 

typically stiffer reinforcement. Whereas for CMCs mechanical bonding 
is more desirable than chemical bonding so that a series of fracture 

mechanisms such as crack-bridgind, crack deflection, fiber fracture and 
fiber pull-out can take place. The energy consumed in these fracture 
mechanisms leads to an enhanced fracture toughness and a non-

catastrophic failure mode (CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006). 
The main advantage of CMCs and MMCs have in common, in 

comparison with PMC’s, are the higher temperature ranges that these 

materials can be submitted (CHAWLA, et al., 2006). 
A metal matrix composite has usually a ductile matrix. The most 

efficient fibers are graphite, boron, carbides, and oxides, which are 
brittle. In the case of ceramic matrix composites, usually both matrix 
and fibers are brittle (MILEIKO, 1997). 

This work relates with short alumina fibers reinforced CMCs and 
MMCs. The characteristic of such materials will be described in the 
following sections. 

A big variety of processing routes are available to produce CMCs 
and MMCs such as (CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006; 

GERMAN, 1990; SURESH, et al., 1993; CHOU, et al., 1985): 

i. Cold pressing and sintering; 
ii. Hot pressing; 

iii. Injection molding; 
iv. Conventional extrusion; 
v. Forging; 

vi. Rolling; 
vii. Reaction and diffusion bonding; 

viii. Casting or liquid infiltration; 
ix. Squeeze casting or pressure infiltration; 
x. Spray co-deposition 

xi. Direct oxidation – Lanxide™ process; 
xii. In-situ chemical reaction techniques; 

xiii. Sol-gel; 
xiv. Polymer infiltration and pyrolysis – PIP; 
xv. Self-propagation high temperature synthesis – SHS; 

xvi. Electrophoretic deposition; 
xvii. Explosive shock consolidation;

Compared with these processes, thermoplastic powder extrusion 

features two main advantages regarding the processing of fibrous 
composites. First it is a process, like others related feedstock processing 

routes, which induces fiber alignment (GERMAN, 1990; SHENOY, 
1999; CALOW, et al., 1972). The fiber alignment can be good to tailor 
properties such as strength and creep resistance in a preferential 

direction (CALOW, et al., 1971). Figure 2 shows schematically the 
concept of fiber alignment obtained with PIM processing. 

 
Figure 2 – Schematic diagram showing fiber alignment due to contracting and 

expanding flow during injection or feedstock extrusion process. 

Source: German (1990). 

Fiber alignment is not an exclusivity of feedstock processing, 
other routes including conventional extrusion, rolling, forging and 

squeeze casting may also grant an oriented microstructure (CHAWLA, 
et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993). Figure 3 shows a quantitative 

analysis of the degree of orientation of SiC particles in a conventionally 
extruded MMC.

an extruded 2080 aluminum alloy matrix composite with 20 vol.% of 
reinforcement fraction. The degree of orientation is defined by the angle of a 

given article to loading axis. 
Source: Chawla, et al (2006). 

However, because of the high strains associated with process 
such as rolling, forging and conventional extrusion, fracture of short 

fibers and even particles take place, which can be detrimental to the 
properties of the composite (CHAWLA, et al., 2006). The fracture of 
fibers leads to the second advantage of feedstock processing, e.g. 

thermoplastic powder extrusion, because due to the low viscosity of the 
feedstock at molding temperatures, both fibers and particles are 

subjected to lower strains, as compared with conventional extrusion, 
which avoids fiber breaking (GERMAN, 1990). 

The breaking of fiber is acceptable until the fibers reaches a 

minimum length at which it is still effective, i.e. contributes to increase 
the strength and stiffness of the composite. This length is called critical 

length lc, and depends on the fiber diameter df, the fiber strength ?f* and 

on the interface shear strength ?i*, according to Equation 1 (MILEIKO, 
1997; CALLISTER, 2006; CALOW, et al., 1972).

2.1.1. Alumina based fibers as reinforcement 

Ceramic fibers are very attractive for reinforcement of both 

CMCs and MMCs. They combine high strength, high modulus, 
chemical resistance, high temperature capabilities, being ideal 
candidates for high temperature applications (CHAWLA, 2003). 

Due to the small cross section and large aspect ratio, ceramic 
fibers have two very important features: their high degree of flexibility 
and higher strength than the bulk material of the same composition 

(CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006). 
A big problem of high temperature applications is the oxidation 

when the material is exposed to oxidizing atmosphere (LEV, et al., 
1995). Carbon fibers oxidizes easily at temperatures above 400 °C. 
Silicon carbide (SiC) fibers are also prone to oxidation at temperatures 

higher than 1200 °C (CHAWLA, 2003). A solution to the oxidation 
problem demands the use of oxide fibers (LEV, et al., 1995). Oxide 
fibers are available since 1970s and have been thoroughly investigated 

(CHAWLA, 2003). 
Among the oxides, alumina is one of the most stable in a variety 

of environments, although its melting point, 2050 °C, is not one of the 
highest. Its thermodynamically stable phase is the hexagonal ?-Al2O3 
(CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006), which the structure is 
shown on Figure 4.

Since decades many companies produce in high scale 

polycrystalline alumina fibers, being the fibers produced by Du Pont, 

Sumitomo Chemical Co., and 3M Co. (formerly known as Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing Co.) among the most commercialized 
(CHAWLA, 2003). 

The highest performance fibers that are now available in adequate 
quantities and at reasonable cost are fine-grained high-purity alumina 

(Nextel™ 610) and alumina/mullite (Nextel™ 720) fibers produced by 
the 3M Co. The Nextel™ 610 has the highest strength (~3.3 GPa) and 
higher corrosion resistance, while the Nextel™ 720 shows better creep 

resistance, being stable at higher temperatures, 1200 °C for Nextel™ 
720 against 1100 °C for The Nextel™ 610 (MARSHALL, et al., 2001). 

Table 1 shows the data of some of the commercially available 

alumina fibers.

Nextel fibers are polycrystalline which gives them isotropic 
properties, e.g. isotropic thermal expansion, what can make easier to 



46 
 

avoid thermal expansion mismatch between matrix and fibers 

(CHAWLA, 2003). 
Sintering of alumina fibers should not exceed 1300 °C. Above 

this temperature the properties of the fibers reduces due to degradation 
(LEE, et al., 2003). 

2.1.2. Metal matrix composites 

Metal matrix composites development has been impelled by some 
advantages with respect to unreinforced metals. Comparing with the 
analog unreinforced metal, MMCs may enhance the following 

properties (CHAWLA, et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993): 

i. Specific strength; 
ii. Specific modulus; 

iii. Dimensional stability; 
iv. Reduced coefficient of thermal expansion; 
v. Creep resistance; 

vi. Fatigue resistance; 
vii. Wear resistance; 

viii. Isotropy. 

When compared with CMCs, metal matrix composites have as 

advantage higher thermal, electrical conductivity and fracture toughness 
(SURESH, et al., 1993; CHAWLA, 2003). 

Examples of metals commonly used as the matrix on composites 

are: aluminum and aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, magnesium and 
magnesium alloys, cobalt, iron and iron alloys, copper, silver, nickel and 
nickel alloys, including nickel superalloys, niobium, and intermetallics

1
 

(CHAWLA, et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993). 
For high temperature applications the matrix systems are mainly 

nickel-, niobium-, and cobalt-based alloys, as well as intermetallics. The 

MMCs with these matrix systems are developed for applications at 
temperatures over 800 °C (SURESH, et al., 1993).

 The chemical bond in intermetallics is actually not metallic, but ionic or covalent in nature. 

Intermetallics are formed when two dissimilar metals are combined following chemical 

valence rules, i.e. ionic or covalent rules (CHAWLA, et al., 2006). 



47 

 

The two main routes to produce MMCs are via liquid state 

processing and solid state processing. The advantages of the solid state 
processing, which is mostly based on powder metallurgy techniques, is 

the control of reinforcement distribution, uniformity of matrix 
microstructure, and lower degree of interfacial reaction between matrix 
and reinforcement which can be detrimental to the reinforcement 

(CHAWLA, et al., 2006). 
Increasingly MMCs are used in several areas including 

aerospace, automotive and railway industries; electronics; thermal 

management; filamentary superconducting magnets; power 
transmission; sporting goods; and wear-resistant materials (CHAWLA, 

et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993). 

2.1.2.1. Alumina fibers reinforced nickel based composites 

The study and development of alumina reinforced nickel based 

composites was driven the high temperature and oxidation resistance of 
nickel alloys and the availability of alumina whiskers. A promising 
application for such composites was high temperature turbine blades. 

However problems with thermal expansion compatibility (see Table 2), 
whiskers degradation and weak interface bond made retarded the 

development of these composites (CALOW, et al., 1972; CALOW, et 
al., 1971; MILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et al., 2004).

Chemical interaction between fiber and matrix is inevitable if 

there is no thermodynamic equilibrium between them. The consequence 
will be an interface region containing substances with properties 

different from the matrix and fiber (MILEIKO, 1997). 
Nevertheless difficulties on predicting and avoiding those 

interactions arise for many reasons. First because phase diagrams of 



48 
 

complex systems elements used in MMCs are unknown. Secondly the 

kinetics cannot be described without experiments. Thirdly the influence 
of the interface on the properties of the composite can be varied and 

depends on the type of load (MILEIKO, 1997). 
For systems forming interfaces, such as Ni and Al2O3, it is 

important to predict those product phases formed by diffusion bonding 

during sintering. However, even if all the thermodynamic data are 
known, it is still hard to determine which phases will be present in the 
interface. In the case of the system Ni-Al-O, two different situations can 

exists, as shown in Figure 5. In high vacuum conditions, with activity of 
oxygen under 10

-12
, the diffusion path (path I) follows the side of an 

aluminum rich phase, poor in oxygen, and no product phase is formed. 
On the other hand, if the activity of oxygen is higher, the diffusion path 
follows the tie line that connects the nickel and the spinel (path II), and 

spinel is formed (SURESH, et al., 1993). For pure nickel matrix, 
substantial amount of spinel nickel aluminate, NiAl2O4, can form above 
1100 °C (CALOW, et al., 1971). 

 
Figure 5 – Ni-Al-O isothermal phase diagram at 1600 K. 

Two reaction paths are possible when nickel is bonded to 
Al2O3. (I) low oxygen activity, no reaction product form. 

(II) high oxygen activity, spinel forms.

49 

 

One of the consequences of the interaction between the ceramic 

fiber and the metal matrix is the degradation of the fiber, leading to 
reduction of fiber strength. Degradation of alumina reinforcement in a 

nickel-based matrix has been reported (MILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et 
al., 2002a; CALOW, et al., 1971; CALOW, et al., 1972). Table 3 shows 
the critical temperature Tc and time of exposure in the critical 

temperature tc in which sapphire whiskers, i.e. monocrystalline alumina, 
starts to degrade in the presence of different nickel-based matrix.

There are three possibilities to avoid such interactions and 
degradation of the alumina fibers. The first obvious possibility is not to 
submit the MMC to a long-term exposure at high temperatures during 

fabrication, what would lead to low densification. The second possibility 
is matrix alloying; introducing alloying elements on the nickel matrix 

reduces its interaction with fibers, what has been already experimentally 
demonstrated with elements such as chromium, aluminum, 
molybdenum, tungsten, and cobalt (MILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et al., 

2002a; CALOW, et al., 1971). Another advantage of alloying the nickel 
matrix is the reduction of sintering temperature. Pure nickel sintering 
temperatures are between 1300 and 1350 °C (CALOW, et al., 1972; 

JOHNSON, et al., 2004). Nevertheless is worthy to mention that 
sintering of highly porous nickel components, with porosity up to 80 %, 
can be obtained by sintering loose carbonyl nickel powder at 

temperatures between 850 and 1050 °C (ASM International, 2000). 
The third option to minimize degradation lies on the use of 

diffusion barriers, avoiding the direct contact between fiber and matrix. 
Examples of diffusion barriers for nickel matrix composites are HfO2, 
Y2O3, TiC, ZiN, and HfC. Alumina coated with Y2O3-W-Ni has been 

also reported (MILEIKO, 1997). 
If on one hand reaction between the metal matrix and alumina 

fiber can be detrimental to the final properties of the composite, on the 

other hand, as mentioned in the previous section, a minimum of 



50 
 

chemical interaction is required for MMCs to guarantee a proper load 

transfer from matrix to the fibers. Following this approach the formation 
of a complex oxide AlxMyOz at the interface, where M is an alloying 

element of the nickel matrix, might be also desirable (MILEIKO, et al., 
2002a). Some alloying elements, e.g. chromium, improve the bond 
strength without though causing chemical reaction (CALOW, et al., 

1971). 
Tests has shown that nickel alloys reinforced with different 

alumina based fibers have higher creep resistance than any available 

non-reinforced nickel superalloys (MILEIKO, et al., 2002b; MILEIKO, 
et al., 2004). The potential for such composites is the use at 

temperatures up to 1200 °C (MILEIKO, 2002). 

2.1.2.2. Nickel superalloys 

As mentioned in the previous section, alloying the nickel matrix 

is one of the possible approaches to minimize fiber-matrix detrimental 
interactions (MILEIKO, 1997). Nickel based superalloys are well 
known for its high temperature strength and resistance. However, nickel 

based superalloys limiting temperature is below 1100 °C. The only way 
to enhance the use temperature of such alloys is reinforcing them with 

creep-resistant ceramic fibers (MILEIKO, et al., 2002a; MILEIKO, et 
al., 2002b). 

Superalloys are the class of heat-resisting alloys based on nickel, 

nickel-iron, or cobalt. These alloys exhibit a combination of strength 
and corrosion resistance at elevated and cryogenic temperatures, what 
make them useful for many applications in the aerospace, automotive, 

medical, chemical and petrochemical industries (JOHNSON, et al., 
2004). 

Their high strength and toughness make them difficult to shape 

via machining and forging. For this reason powder metallurgy 
techniques, including powder injection molding, are alternative routes 

that have been used to process these materials (JOHNSON, et al., 2004). 
Among the superalloys that have been processed via powder 

injection molding, IN718 nickel superalloy has been the most 

extensively studied. This alloy is usually sintered at temperatures 
between 1250 and 1275 °C to densities close to 100% (ASM 
International, 2000; JOHNSON, et al., 2004; VALENCIA, et al., 1997; 



51 

 

BOSE, et al., 1997; VALENCIA, et al., 1994; HAJMRLE, et al., 1980). 

The alloy IN625 is another alloy that can be processed by powder 
injection molding; however this alloy requires higher sintering 

temperatures, above 1290 °C to achieve full density (JOHNSON, et al., 
2004). 

The alloy IN718 is a precipitation-hardenable nickel-chromium 

alloy that combines corrosion resistance and high strength. It has 
excellent creep-rupture strength at temperatures up to 700 °C. Used in 
gas turbines, rocket motors, spacecraft, nuclear reactors, pumps, and 

tooling. It can form liquid phase during sintering as its melt temperature 
range is between 1260 and 1336 °C (Special Metals Corporation, 2008). 

The temperature in which sintering starts is reported to be in the range 
of ~1160 °C. At this temperature liquid phase sintering is also likely to 
take place (HAJMRLE, et al., 1980).

IN625 is nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy with an addition of 
niobium that acts with the molybdenum to stiffen the alloy’s matrix and 
thereby provide high strength without a strengthening heat treatment. 

The alloy resists a wide range of severely corrosive environments. Used 
in chemical processing, aerospace and marine engineering, pollution-



52 
 

control equipment, and nuclear reactors. Its melting point range is 1290 

to 1350 °C (Special Metals Corporation, 2008). 
The composition of IN718 and IN625 superalloys are given on 

Table 4. 

2.1.3. Ceramic matrix composites 

Although high performance ceramics have high strength, high 

hardness, excellent high temperature capabilities, chemical inertness, 
high wear resistance and all allied to low density; these materials have 
an inherent brittleness, i.e. low fracture toughness, being prone to 

catastrophic failure under mechanical or thermal stresses in the presence 
of crack-like defects (CHAWLA, 2003). Increase thermal shock 

resistance and toughness of these materials, making them damage 
tolerant by introducing reinforcement fibers is the main purpose of the 
productions of CMCs (CHAWLA, 2003; CINIBULK, et al., 2004; 

HACKEMANN, et al., 2010). The fiber reinforced CMCs may also 
show higher tensile strength, stiffness and creep than the monolithic 
ceramics (CINIBULK, et al., 2004; HACKEMANN, et al., 2010). 

For the selection of the matrix and fibers for a specific 
application, the following properties should be considered (CHAWLA, 

2003): 

i. Melting temperature; 
ii. Volatility; 

iii. Density; 
iv. Elastic modulus; 
v. Thermal expansion coefficient; 

vi. Creep characteristics; 
vii. Strength 

viii. Fracture toughness; 
ix. Chemical and thermal compatibility between fiber and 

matrix. 

Some of the items above are discussed in the following section, 
justifying the selection of the alumina-alumina CMCs used in the 
present work. 



53 

 

The production of CMCs is driven by cost reduction in terms of 

fabrication and maintenance, weight reduction (mainly for aerospace 
and automotive industry), higher operation temperatures (CHAWLA, 

2003). Examples of applications for fiber reinforced CMCs are shown in 
Table 5.

2.1.3.1. Alumina fibers reinforced alumina matrix composites 

The undesirable need for environmental barrier coatings to 
protect SiC based composites, adds motivation to develop oxide 

composite systems that are inherently stable in oxidizing environments 
(MARSHALL, et al., 2001). 

All-oxide ceramic matrix composites have currently been 

developed for long term applications at high temperature and oxidizing 
environmental conditions, e.g. combustor walls of gas turbines for 
power generation or for propulsion, exhaust components, high 

temperature ducts, thermal insulation, heat exchangers and hot-gas 
filters (HACKEMANN, et al., 2010; MARSHALL, et al., 2001). 

Despite the problem of oxidation at high temperature applications 

is solved with all-oxide composites, they show lower creep resistance, 
as compared to the covalently bonded SiC, due to their predominant 

ionic bond (HACKEMANN, et al., 2010). Nevertheless a composite 
matching oxide fiber and oxide matrix, e.g. Al2O3-Al2O3, is an answer to 
the problems of thermal expansion mismatch and chemical 



54 
 

compatibility between the elements of the composite (LEV, et al., 

1995). 
Alumina fiber reinforced alumina matrix composites should be 

sintered at temperatures below 1300 °C. Composites sintered above this 
temperature tend to fracture in a completely brittle mode due to fiber 
degradation. For non coated fiber, like Nextel™ 610, the optimum 

sintering temperature is 1200 °C, however pressure should be 
simultaneously applied to achieve high densities (LEE, et al., 2003).  

2.2. POROUS MATERIALS 

 
Porous materials are any solid material which contains cavities, 

channels or interstices. Most of the materials are porous to some extend 
and it is actually difficult to find or either prepare a real non-porous 
material, i.e. with null porosity. The degree of porosity influences 

directly on physical properties of the materials and its control is of great 
industrial importance. Porosity also affects the chemical reactivity of 
solids and the physical interaction of solids with gases and liquids 

(ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). 
Pores can be classified according to size, shape and availability to 

an external fluid. According to IUPAC, the classification of pore size is 
made as follows (STUDART, et al., 2006; ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994): 

i. Microporosity – pores width smaller than 2 nm; 
ii. Mesoporosity – pores width between 2 and 50 nm; 

iii. Macroporosity – pores width larger than 50 nm. 

According to the availability to an external fluid, pores can be 

categorized into two main groups: closed and open pores. Closed pores 
are totally isolated from their neighbors. This type of pores is 
represented by the pore (a) in Figure 6. Open pores are those which have 

a continuous channel of communication with the external surface of the 
body, like pores (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) in Figure 6. Yet, open pores can 

be sub-classified into through pores, like (c), (d) and (e), which are 
those open at two or more ends; or sub-classified as blind pores, like (b) 
and (f), open in only one extremity (ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). 



55 

 

From the shape point of view, pores can be cylindrical, like (c) 

and (f); ink-bottle shaped like (b); funnel shaped like (d); or slit shaped 
(ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). 

The region marked as (g) in Figure 6 is not a pore, but roughness. 
To distinguish pore from roughness, an adopted convention consider 
that roughness are irregularities on the solid surface whose width is 

larger than its deepness (ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). 

 
Figure 6 – Schematic cross-section of a 

porous solid showing different types of pores. 
Source: Rouquerol, et al (1994). 

. 
Applications for porous materials include (ISHIZAKI, et al., 

1998): 

i. Filters; 
ii. Burners; 

iii. Catalysts; 
iv. Bioreactors; 
v. Cells; 

vi. Grinding wheels; 
vii. Gas sensors; 

viii. Gas separators; 
ix. Electrodes; 
x. Porous metals bearings; 

xi. Thermal insulators; 
xii. Capacitors; 

xiii. Impact energy absorbers; 



56 
 

xiv. Heaters and heat exchangers; 
xv. Molds; 

xvi. Surgical implants. 

Porous materials can be produced by several routes, sintering 
powders compacts is one of them (ISHIZAKI, et al., 1998). Since the 
1940’s, porous metallic filters have been fabricated via powder-binder 

mixture extrusion. Corrosion-resistant metals, such as stainless steel, 
titanium, and nickel-based alloys, are the most suitable for filtration 
(GERMAN, 2005). In order to produce open porous materials with 

desired properties it is necessary to control powder properties, green 
body properties and sintering processes (ISHIZAKI, et al., 1998) 

The main methods to characterize porous solids are 
(ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994):  

i. Stereology; 
ii. Radiation scattering; 

iii. Pycnometry; 
iv. Adsorption from a gas phase; 
v. Methods depending on interfacial curvature (intrusion, 

suction, maximum bubble pressure); 

vi. Fluid flow; 
vii. Calorimetric determinations (immersion calorimetry, gas 

or liquid adsorption calorimetry, thermoporometry); 

viii. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC); 
ix. Xenon NMR; 
x. Ultrasonic methods. 

The replacement of solid material by voids in the component 
provides the materials some special features, such as (STUDART, et al., 
2006): 

i. Low thermal mass; 
ii. Low thermal conductivity; 

iii. Controlled permeability; 
iv. High surface area; 
v. Low bulk density; 

vi. Low dielectric constant. 



57 

 

These properties can be tailored by changing type of porosity, i.e. 

open or close, pore mean size, pore size distribution, and pore 
morphology. All this microstructural aspects are highly influenced by 

the processing route used to produce a porous material (STUDART, et 
al., 2006). 

Macroporous materials with open porosity can be made from 

particles or discontinuous fibers by partially sintering previous porous 
compacts, or by sintering powder mixtures that undergo reactions that 
lead to pore formation (FERNANDO, et al., 2005; INNOCENTINI, et 

al., 2009; STUDART, et al., 2006). These macroporous materials 
generally have porosity between 20 and 97% with pore size ranging 

from 400 nm to 4 mm (STUDART, et al., 2006). 
Applications for macroporous ceramic materials are: hot-gas 

filtration, molten metal filtration, diffusion, dispersion rolls, ink pads for 

fingerprinting, high temperature thermal insulators, burners and 
numerous others (FERNANDO, et al., 2005; PRABHAKARAN, et al., 
2005; STUDART, et al., 2006). Some of these components are made of 

ceramic materials or high temperature metal alloys (WOOD, et al., 
2008), e.g. refractory metals and superalloys. 

2.2.1. Hot-gas filters 

Hot-gas filters are porous, closed-end tubes used to remove fine 
particles in a variety of operations (CHAWLA, 2003). Advanced power 

systems, such as the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and 
pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC), requiring gas turbines, 
are technologies to produce electricity and steam from coal and other 

hydrocarbon fuels with high efficiency and reduced emissions of sulfur 
dioxide and other pollutants. Removal of particulate and other emissions 
is required for these processes to protect the gas turbines against erosion 

and corrosion. To maintain a high thermal efficiency, the gas cleaning 
should be done without a previous cooling of the gases. Filtration then 

should be carried at over 350 °C for IGCC and 750 °C for PFBC. 
Moreover the filters must withstands backpressure pulses used on filter 
cleaning, i.e. removal of filter cake from the filters (DUO, et al., 1999; 

CHAWLA, 2003; INNOCENTINI, et al., 2009). 
Other applications for hot-gas filters are coal gasification, 

incineration, catalytic recovery, catalytic processing, chemical and 



58 
 

petrochemical processing (FERNANDO, et al., 2002; CHAWLA, 

2003). 
After rapid development over the past decade, ceramic barrier 

filters have emerged as the most promising choice for hot-gas cleaning 
because of their high corrosion resistance and their ability to withstand 
high temperatures up to 1000 °C (DUO, et al., 1999). 

Membranes with pore size ranging from 0.1 to 50 ?m and 
porosity above about 40% are adequate for use in hot-gas filtration 
(FERNANDO, et al., 2005). Other requirements for hot-gas filters are: 

(DUO, et al., 1999; CHAWLA, 2003; FERNANDO, et al., 2002; 
INNOCENTINI, et al., 2009) 

i. Long-term durability; 
ii. High temperature capabilities; 

iii. Alkali corrosion resistance; 
iv. Cleanability; 
v. Thermal shock resistance; 

vi. Impermeability to particulates to be filtered; 
vii. Optimized permeability to the gas; 

viii. Lightweight; 
ix. High toughness.

Hot-gas filters membranes have been made of Saffil alumina 

fibers (90 wt.%) and a binder (10 wt.%). The pore size of these filters 

ranged from 1 to 23 ?m, and was considered adequate for fine particles 

filtration (FERNANDO, et al., 2002). The microstructure of this type of 
membrane is shown in Figure 7. 

2.2.2. Porous CMCs 

There is an unconventional approach to design microstructures of 
composites that are damage tolerant. It relies on the weakness and low 
stiffness of a porous matrix to prevent damage from extending into the 

fibers (CINIBULK, et al., 2004). In this case the interface between the 
fibers and matrix might be strongly bonded (MARSHALL, et al., 2001). 

The failure strain in such CMCs is greater than in monolithic ceramic. 
Matrix crack energy is dissipated through multiple microfractures in the 
porous matrix, through weak interparticle bonding. These materials can 

retain their mechanical properties after long-term exposure to 1100°C 
during cyclic tension and fatigue (CINIBULK, et al., 2004). Processing 
of porous CMCs is easier because a high density is not required, thus 

low sintering temperatures can be used, avoiding fiber degradation 
(CHAWLA, 2003). 

A process called WHIPOX™ (Wound Highly Porous Oxide 

CMC) was developed to produce such composites. A CMC composed 
by Nextel™ fibers in a porous mullite matrix was produced through this 

process. Rings and tubes of 20 and 250 mm long were sintered in air at 
1300 °C for 60 min. The fiber volume fraction varied from 25 to 50 %. 
The porosity of the matrix was found to be over 60 vol.%. Figure 8 

shows the microstructure of such composites (CHAWLA, 2003). 



60

WHIPOX process.

Some industries are interested in the performance of porous 

CMCs. In particular energy related components, including porous 
radiant burners and hot-gas filters, need new materials to achieve higher 
operating temperatures, higher efficiency and longer service life. 

Radiant burners transfer a substantial fraction of their energy input 
directly to the process load as infrared radiation. Increased radiant 
output and fuel efficiency are the main benefits of using CMCs in 

radiant burners (CHAWLA, 2003). 
Hot-gas filters are normally made of conventional monolithic 

ceramics that fail easily during cleaning operations, which involve 

backpressure pulses. The higher toughness, higher strength, higher creep 
resistance and thermal shock resistance of CMCs can be exploited in 

these components. Composites consisting of Nextel™ 610 or Nextel™ 
312 fibers in a silicon carbide or alumina matrix have been made for 
filtering gas streams at temperatures up to 1000 °C (CHAWLA, 2003). 

2.3. POWDER THERMOPLASTIC EXTRUSION 

Extrusion is a process used to form long shapes with continuous 
cross section, such as rods, tubes, honeycombs and other infinite variety 



61 

 

of profiles. In the industry, extrusion is a common process used in the 

fields of metallurgy, ceramics, polymers and foodstuffs 
(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 

Powder thermoplastic extrusion is the molding process of 
particulate materials, in which a feedstock, i.e. powder-binder mixture, 
is forced through a die, where the compact extruded acquires the shape 

of the die channel (GERMAN, 2005). 
After molding a debinding step is necessary to remove the 

binders and finally the component is sintered (GERMAN, 2005). 

2.3.1. Basics concepts on particulate materials processing 

The processing of materials through powder, commonly known 

as particulate materials processing (PMP), is an attractive technology 
due to its replication capabilities and the viability to tailor the product 
application through the selective placement of phases or pores. 

Moreover PMP is in many cases the most competitive available 
technology that allows the production of materials such as composites, 
high-temperature ceramics, certain polymers, copper steels, refractory 

metals, intermetallics and cermets (GERMAN, 2005). These materials 
couldn’t be processed in an economically viable way through 

conventional routes such as casting, and in many cases no other route is 
available. 

The porosity control makes PMP an useful technology to produce 

components for filtration, lubrication and energy dissipation 
(GERMAN, 2005). 

Particulate material processing consist basically on conforming or 

molding a chosen powder into a desired shape, and through a heat 
treatment called sintering, bond the particles together, making the initial 
individual particles become a solid body (GERMAN, 2005). 

Two are the major routes to form a green body, compaction or 
shaping. The green body is the name given to the compact before 

sintering, it consist of powder and usually additives, that are added to 
improve conformability and/or help the compact retain its shape and 
improve mechanical strength during manufacturing steps that take place 

before sintering (GERMAN, 2005). 
Compaction is applied for granulates and powders with low 

amount of additives, whereas shaping is applied for plastic consistence 



62 
 

feeds and slurries containing high amount of additives (GERMAN, 

2005). 
Compaction technologies can be divided into die compaction, 

cold isostatic compaction
2
, hot pressing and rolling pressing. Examples 

of shaping technologies are injection molding, plastic extrusion, 
thermoplastic extrusion, rolling, thermosetting and thermoplastic 

pressing, porcelain pressing and slurry techniques
3
 (REED, 1995; 

GERMAN, 2005). 

2.3.2. Powders 

Powder processing technologies deal generally with particles in 
the range from some dozen nanometers to hundreds of microns. The 

main aspects of the powders to be characterized are (GERMAN, 2005): 

i. Particle size and particle size distribution (PSD); 
ii. Particle shape; 

iii. Particle agglomeration; 
iv. Surface area; 
v. Interparticle friction; 

vi. Flow and packing; 
vii. Internal structure; 

viii. Composition, homogeneity and contamination. 

These characteristics are imposed by the material and especially 
by the powder synthesis and fabrication technique. 

The shape of the particles is a very important factor on the 
processing and affects directly the packing, flow and compressibility 
(GERMAN, 2005). Figure 9 gives a collection of possible particles 

shapes. The most appropriate way to characterize the particle shape is 
through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Light scattering particle

 Also known as cold isostatic pressing, CIP. A variant of CIP is hot isostatic pressing, HIP, in 

which a previously sintered body is subjected to a pressurized hot-gas (REED, 1995). HIP is 

considered an enhanced sintering process rather than an compaction process.

 Slurry techniques comprise: Slip casting, tape casting, pressure casting, slurry pressing, 

vacuum casting, centrifugal casting, gel casting, casting concrete and others.

size analyzers and gas adsorption (BET) are other important techniques 

to characterize PSD and surface area of powders (GERMAN, 2005).

2.3.3. Additives 

Additives are inorganic or organic chemicals used to tailor 
powder characteristics (GERMAN, 2005). They can be categorized as 

follows: 

i. Solvent – used as a temporary liquid to disperse other 
additives; 

ii. Dispersant or deflocculant – separate particles braking 
agglomerates; 

iii. Coagulant or flocculant- promotes particle 
agglomeration; 

iv. Plasticizer – used to lower the viscosity of the mixture 
and modifies the viscoelastic properties of a condensed 
binder film on the particles; 

v. Surfactant or wetting agent– improves binder-powder 
wetting; 

vi. Foaming and antifoaming agent – controls the formation 
of bubbles in the mixture; 

vii. Thickener – increases the apparent viscosity of the 
mixture; 

viii. Binder – provides green strength; 
ix. Lubricant – minimizes tool wear; 



64 
 

x. Preservative – reduces enzymatic degradation of a binder 
(GERMAN, 2005; REED, 1995). 

2.3.3.1. Binders 

Binders are polymers molecules that form a bridge between 
particles and provide interparticle binding action (REED, 1995). The 
combination of powder and binder is the so called feedstock 

(GERMAN, 2005). 
There are several materials that can be used as binders such as 

organic matter of clays, natural gums, waxes, vinyl, cellulose, 

polyethylene glycol, resins (thermoplastics), gels, low-temperature 
reaction bonds, hydraulic cements, and so on (REED, 1995). 

Binder’s most important function is to improve the strength of the 
as-formed product allowing it to be handled before the product is 
densified by sintering (REED, 1995). 

Polymers and waxes derived from petroleum such as low density 
polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), 
polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and paraffin wax are commonly 

used. Some natural waxes like carnauba wax (derived from the leaves of 
a Brazilian palm tree), candelilla wax and beeswax are also widely used 

(GERMAN, 2005; REED, 1995). 
Polymers resins, e.g. PE, PP and PS, are usually added to form a 

bonding matrix. The strength, melting temperature and viscosity of these 

thermoplastics increase with the average molecular weight (REED, 
1995). 

2.3.3.2. Surfactants 

Surfactants are molecules which have a polar group in one 
extremity and have a nonpolar chain on the other side. The polar group 
attracts polar molecules and is called lyophilic group. The nonpolar 

group, usually a hydrocarbon chain, is the lyophobic group (REED, 
1995). Figure 10 shows a sketch of a surfactant and its behavior on 

different means. 



65 

 

Surfactants improve the compatibility of the solid with the liquid 

medium, when adsorbed at the interface solid-liquid, reducing the 

surface tension ?SL. The driving force for the adsorption of these 

molecules at a surface or interface is the reduction of Gibbs free energy 

?G (REED, 1995). 

 
Figure 10 – Surfactant sketch showing its hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, 

and the behavior of a surfactant in different means.

Examples of surfactants are: stearic acid, ethoxylated 
nonylphenol, ethoxylated tridecyl alcohol, sodium stearate, sodium 

disopropylnaphtalene sulfonate, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride 
and sodium dodecyl sulfate (REED, 1995; GERMAN, 1990). 

2.3.3.3. Plasticizers 

Ceramic systems containing a binder are molded above the glass 
transition temperature Tg of the binder. Plasticizers usually have a 

smaller molecule than the binder. This molecules are distributed among 
the chains of the binder reduces the Van der Waals forces that binds the 
polymer molecules together. This makes the binder to soften and 

increase its flexibility, but also reduces its strength. Essentially the 
plasticizer reduces the Tg of the polymer (REED, 1995). In general the 
plasticizer have a low melting point (Tm). 

Oils and waxes are used as plasticizers in the case of 
thermoplastic binders such as PE and PS. Stearic acid and oleic acid 

behave as plasticizers for waxes (REED, 1995). 



66 
 

2.3.4. Rheology 

Rheology is the science of deformation and flow (REED, 1995). 
The study of the rheological behavior of a fluid material is of high 

importance for the design and selection of the equipments for processing 
a feedstock (GERMAN, 1990). 

The most important rheological property of a feedstock is the 

viscosity. The second important property is the elasticity. Elastic 
materials exhibit a shape memory effect, which implies that part of the 
submitted deformation is recovered after the stress is ceased. Feedstocks 

exhibit both viscous and elastics characteristics and are therefore termed 
viscoelastic fluids (GERMAN, 1990). 

One of the effects of the viscoelasticity of polymers is the 
phenomenon known as extrudate swell

4
, in which the diameter of the 

extrudate out of the die is considerably higher than the diameter of the 

die orifice. This occurs because the viscoelastic fluid recovers part of its 
deformation – the elastic portion – underwent when it was forced into 
the die (SHENOY, 1999) 

2.3.4.1. Shear flow 

The steady simple shear flow can be described by the scheme of 

Figure 11. The situation describes a fluid being sheared by two plates of 
area A separated by a distance dx2. The lower plate moves with a 
velocity v1 and the upper plate with a velocity v1+dv1. The differential 

velocity dv1 is imposed by the force f. 

The velocity gradient    [s
-1

] is also called shear rate and can be 

defined as shows Equation 2, where the term dx1/dx2 describes the shear 

strain ?. The shear stress ? [Pa], necessary to shear the fluid and 
maintain a laminar flow, can be defined as it is shown on Equation 3. 

Finally Equation 4 defines the viscosity ? [Pa?s], referred to as steady 
state viscosity, which correlates shear rate and shear stress.

 Also known as die swell, jet swell, Barus effect or Merrington effect (SHENOY, 1999).

Equation 4   
   

  
 

Viscosity is the resistance of the fluid to any irreversible 

positional change of its volume elements (SHENOY, 1999). In other 
words, viscosity is the resistance of the fluid to shear. Equation 4 is 

valid for Newtonian fluids in which the shear stress ? is linearly 
dependent on the velocity gradient    (REED, 1995). Nevertheless the 
nature of the polymers and the filled polymers bring them to the 

category of non-Newtonian fluids (SHENOY, 1999). 



68 
 

2.3.4.2. The effect of shear rate and time on non-Newtonian fluids 

For non-Newtonian fluids, the viscosity can be a function of 
shear rate and time (SHENOY, 1999), and the linear relationship 

between shear rate and shear stress may not exist. 
In general non-Newtonian fluids exhibit one of the following 

features: 

i. Shear rate dependent viscosity in certain shear rate 
ranges, with or without elastic behavior; 

ii. Yield stress; 
iii. Time-dependent viscosities at fixed shear rates 

(SHENOY, 1999). 

Depending on which of the previous characteristics a fluid 
exhibit, it can be classified in one of the following models (REED, 
1995; SHENOY, 1999): 

i. Pseudoplastic – its viscosity decreases with increasing of 
shear rate, also called shear thinning fluids,         ; 

ii. Dilatant – its viscosity increases with increasing shear 
rate, also called shear thickening fluids,         ; 

iii. Bingham – flows just after the shear stress exceeds a 
yield stress, then shows a linear relationship between 
shear rate and shear stress; 

iv. Pseudoplastic with yield stress – its viscosity decreases 
with increasing of shear rate and additionally exhibits a 
yield stress; 

v. Dilatants with yield stress – its viscosity increases with 
increasing of shear rate and additionally exhibits a yield 
stress; 

vi. Thixotropic – exhibits a reversible decrease in shear 
stress with time at a constant temperature and shear rate; 

vii. Rheopectic – exhibits a reversible increase in shear stress 
with time at a constant temperature and shear rate; 

viii. Viscoelastic – possesses an elastic component apart from 
the viscosity, showing properties of viscous liquids and 
elastic solids. 



69 

 

Figure 12 shows the variation of shear stress with shear rate for 

some of non-Newtonian fluids models. Polymers – filled or not – can be 
pseudoplastics with or without yield stress, thixotropics and 

viscoelastics (SHENOY, 1999). 

 
Figure 12 – Newtonian and non-Newtonian models of fluid 

behavior. 

Adapted from: Reed (1995) 

Fluids containing large molecules and suspensions containing 

non-attracting anisometric particles, when undergo a laminar flow may 
have the molecules or particles oriented. As orientation reduces the 
resistance to shear, the stress necessary to increase the shear rate 

diminishes with increasing shear rates (REED, 1995). This gives the 
pseudoplastic characteristic of the feedstocks, in which the particles 
have a major effect on the mixture behavior (GERMAN, 1990). 

2.3.4.3. Effect of temperature 

The viscosity of most of the fluids is temperature and pressure 
dependent. The viscosity of a fluid decreases with the increase of 

temperature. And the viscosity ? varies exponentially with the absolute 
temperature T as shown in Equation 5, where T is the temperature in 

Kelvin, ?0 is the viscosity at a reference temperature T0, k is the 



70 
 

Boltzmann’s constant, and E is a material specific constant which 

represents the activation energy for viscous flow. High values of E 
indicate a high sensibility to temperature change (GERMAN, 1990). 

Equation 5          
 

 
  

 

 
 

 

  
   

Figure 13 illustrates the application of Equation 5 for a binder 
system composed by polyethylene and stearic acid, with activation 

energy of 32 kJ/mol (GERMAN, 1990). The plot of the natural 
logarithm of the viscosity, versus the inverse of the temperature is the so 
called Arrhenius plot.

viscosity for a polyethylene and stearic acid mixture.

Polymers loaded with particles, in spite they exhibit higher 
viscosity, are more temperature sensitive than pure polymers. This 
happens because of the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of 

the polymers and the particles. The polymer expands more than the 
particles and the solid volume fraction decreases with the increase of 
temperature. This means that the apparent activation energy Ea is larger 

for loaded systems (GERMAN, 1990). 



71 

 

2.3.4.4. Effect of solid volume fraction 

The viscosity of a loaded polymer increases with the addition of 
powder in the system. Furthermore, there is a limit of solids that can be 

added before the viscosity becomes essentially infinite, and the mixture 
gets too stiff to be considered viscous. For monosized spheres, this limit 
is equal to the maximum random packing condition of 63,7 vol.% of 

solids (GERMAN, 1990), as shown in Figure 14. 
Einstein provided an equation to predict the viscosity of 

suspensions with low solid volume fraction in which the relative 

viscosity ?r, that is the viscosity of the loaded fluid divided by the 
viscosity of the pure fluid, has a linear relationship with the solid 

volume fraction ?, as shown in Equation 6 (GERMAN, 1990), where 
       . 

Equation 6           

Einstein’s viscosity equation postulates a suspension so diluted 
that there is no interaction between particles (MOONEY, 1951). 

Therefore this equation fits well just with low content of solids, i.e. less 
than approximately 15 vol.%, and the relationship between relative 
viscosity and solid volume fraction departs from the linearity with 

higher contents of solids (GERMAN, 1990), as can be seen in Figure 14. 

 
Figure 14 – Relative viscosity versus volume 

fraction of monosized glass spheres.

72 
 

Many other models have been proposed so far, most of them 

based on Einstein’s viscosity equation, to predict the change in viscosity 
with particles loading on a powder-binder mixture. Most of the models, 

nevertheless, assume hard, solid and spherical particles (GERMAN, 

1990), and many of them express ?r as a function of the relative solids 

loading ?r, that is the ratio ?/?m. Moreover, the models have in common 
two boundary conditions that must be satisfied. 

First, the relative viscosity ?r, must be equal to unity for pure 

binder, i.e. the viscosity of the mixture ? approaches the viscosity of the 

binder ?b for solid contents close to zero, as represented by Equation 7. 

Equation 7               

Second, there is a maximum solid volume fraction ?m, and the 
viscosity approaches to infinite when the solid volume fraction 

approaches ?m, as it is shown on Equation 8 (GERMAN, 1990). 

Equation 8                

This happens because, when the solids content is too high, the 
particles are practically in permanent contact with each other, and the 

amount of liquid is sufficient only to fulfill the interstices between the 
particles, as shown in Figure 15, and do not contribute to decrease the 
viscosity of the system. This liquid in the interstices is immobile and 

don’t participates on the basic flow process, therefore the viscosity 
increases dramatically when the solid content reaches this condition. A 

little amount of liquid is enough to form a film between the particles and 
play the role of a lubricant. This mobile liquid reduces the frictional 
interaction of the particles reducing radically the system viscosity. 

Therefore, the suspension viscosity depends on the amount of mobile 
fluid and not on the total amount of fluid (GERMAN, 1990).

liquid when the solid volume fraction ?

Although viscosity data for suspensions of solid spheres are quite 
numerous, the agreement among the various investigations has been 

rather poor, specially on the high concentration regime (FRANKEL, et 
al., 1967), i.e. high filling level. This makes it difficult to predict the 

behavior of suspension with high contents of solids and generate a 
universal model. 

Reasons pointed for the conflicting results are: wall effect in 

capillary viscometers, slip at particle surfaces, insufficient dispersion, 
adsorption, turbulence, sedimentation, and others (FRANKEL, et al., 
1967). 

Some of the suggested models that represent the relative viscosity 
as a function of solid volume fraction are given by Equation 9 to 
Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden. that follows, 

where A, B, k and n are constants that depend on the system (GERMAN, 
1990; REED, 1995).  

Equation 9 represents the model proposed by Eilers. It is an 
empirical based model in which the constant A is a factor related with 

the inverse of the maximum filling level ?m, suggested to be 1.35 by 
Eilers as the inverse of 0.74, that is the packing factor for monosized 
spheres on its close-packed structure. His experimental data however, 
fitted better for a factor of 1.28 and 1.30, what would lead to packing 

factors of 0.78 and 0.77 respectively (EILERS, 1941; EILERS, 1949).

where   
 

  
 

 

    
      

Mooney has also made his contribution and proposed the model 
of Equation 10. This model introduced the concept of crowding factor 

???, which is a function of the ratio r1/r2 of the particle radius in a 
bimodal particle size distribution. Mooney calls the crowding effect the 
occupancy of the remaining free volume, between particles of size r1, by 

the particles of size r2. The constant k is a particular value of ??? called 
the self-crowding factor, which by a purely geometric argument must be 
higher than 1.35 and smaller than 1.91 (MOONEY, 1951). 

Equation 10        
    

    
  

where             

The model of Krieger and Dougherty, Equation 11, takes into 
consideration the non-Newtonian behavior, attributed to ability of the 
shear stress, transmitted through a continuous medium, to orient or 

distort the suspended particles in opposition to the randomizing effects 
of Brownian motion. The variation of viscosity with shear rate is the 
result of the decrease of resistance to flow offered by the oriented or 

distorted arrangement. The appearance of this non-Newtonian behavior 
is related with crowding. Such affirmation derives from the fact that 
these systems show Newtonian behavior up to relatively high 

concentrations, 20 vol.% (KRIEGER, et al., 1959). 

Equation 11       
 

  
 
      

 

Krieger and Dougherty’s model derived from a modification of 

Mooney’s functional analysis, where the constant [?] is the “intrinsic 
viscosity” and should be close to 5/2 (KRIEGER, et al., 1959). 

Frankel and Acrivos achieved one purely theoretical model, with 
no empirical constants. Their model, shown on Equation 12, is valid for 

high concentrations and can be applied for suspensions where ?r 



75 

 

approaches to unity, in other words, when ? tends to ?m (FRANKEL, et 
al., 1967). 

Equation 12      
      

 
  

        
 

  
  

On Equation 12 the constant A is related with the region of 

influence of the particle. The region of influence, called cell by the 
authors, can be of different geometries. Therefore, the constant A can 
represent different numerical values, being fairly sensitive to the 

assumed geometry of the cell. For instance, a spherical cell results in a 

value of 9/8 and a cubic cell results in a value of 3?/16 (FRANKEL, et 
al., 1967). 

Chong and co-workers have also achieved an empirical model, 
Equation 13, of the same type of Eilers’, however with a different 
constant (CHONG, et al., 1971). 

Equation 13            
    

      
  

 
 

Quemada proposed also an equation including the 

pseudoplasticity in his model, like Krieger and Dougherty did, but 
furthermore considered the diffusion coefficient D of particles in the 
medium. So his general formulation considered that viscosity and 

diffusion are both functions of the solid volume fraction ? and shear rate 
  , in mathematical notation         and         (QUEMADA, 1977). 

The model of Quemada assumed a rectangular concentration 
profile with no effective diffusion (QUEMADA, 1977), and a 
rectangular velocity profile. This assumptions were based on a two-

phase flow with a concentrated axial core and a marginal layer, close to 

the wall, with null concentration, ? = 0. Another bound condition was 
that when     , not only    , but also         
(QUEMADA, 1977). Quemada’s approach leads to a very simple 
model, represented by Equation 14.

The models discussed above can be used to predict the relative 

viscosity for a certain solid loading, but there is a range of solid loading 
considered the optimal loading for processing. In practice, this optimal 

loading contains less powder than the maximum filling level 
(GERMAN, 1990).  

One of the reasons is the extremely high viscosity close to the 

maximum filling level. Another reason is that the difference between 
densities of powder and binder implies in a large sensitivity to the 
inherent fluctuations that occurs in compounding a mixture, which is 

made in a weight basis (GERMAN, 1990). That means that a small error 
on weighting of powder and binder during compounding, represent a 

considerable change in volume fraction when working near the 
maximum filling level, as shown in Figure 16. 

 
Figure 16 – Powder volume fraction versus powder weight 

fraction. A small error in the weight is amplified in the 

volume loading near the maximum loading.

Since the viscosity of the mixture changes very rapidly with the 
solid volume content in the region close to the maximum filling level, 

small differences of solid volume fraction can be amplified into large 
viscosity shifts as shown in Figure 17 (GERMAN, 1990).

loading. Small error in volume loading represents large 

changes in viscosity near maximum loading. Relative 
viscosity can become infinite for errors that achieves 

higher loading than the maximum.

2.3.4.5. Effect of particle characteristics 

The size of the particles influences the viscosity of the mixture. 
The smaller the particle size, the higher is the surface area and higher is 
the interaction between particles, increasing the interparticle friction. 

For this reason the viscosity of feedstocks is inversely proportional with 
the particle size. This, though, has just a considerable effect for 

submicrometer particle size (GERMAN, 1990). 
More relevant than the particle size is the particle size 

distribution. PSD influences considerably the viscosity of the system. 

Mixing powder with different sizes improve the packing density and 
thereby decrease the viscosity at any given solid volume fraction 
(GERMAN, 1990). This is because the small particles can occupy the 

interstices of the larger ones, once occupied by immobile fluid. The 
excess of fluid becomes mobile fluid and is available to contribute with 
the flow process. Moreover smaller particles can be interposed between 



78 
 

larger particles and act as a lubricant facilitating the rotation of larger 

particles (SHENOY, 1999). 
The greater the packing density, the lower the relative viscosity 

for the same solid volume fraction. Therefore a wide PSD will give a 
lower viscosity than a narrower one, allowing a higher solid loading 
(GERMAN, 1990). Figure 18 shows the effect of the percentage of 

small particles mixed with larger particles on the viscosity, with a size 
ratio of 21 and solid content of 55 vol.%. 

 
Figure 18 – Effect of the percentage of small particles on 

relative viscosity for a bimodal mixture of spheres at a 

solid content of 55 vol.% and a size ratio of 21. 
Source: German (1990). 

The shape of the particles is also crucial and non-spherical 
particles increase the viscosity of the systems due to the lower inherent 

packing density and higher interparticle friction. Irregular particle shape 
and agglomerated particles decreases the maximum packing density, 
increasing therefore the relative viscosity (GERMAN, 1990). 

The presence of fibers in the feedstocks will increase the 
viscosity, increase the shear thinning effect, due to alignment, and 
increase the strength of the green body after solidification (GERMAN, 

1990). 
As more the ratio lengh-diameter L/D departs from the unit, 

lower is the maximum loading and higher is the relative viscosity for a 
same solid content (GERMAN, 1990), as can be seen on Figure 19.

viscosity for a suspension of glass particles in water. The

influence.

2.3.4.6. Rheometry 

Rheometry is the measurement arm of rheology and is used to 

quantify the rheological parameters of practical importance. A 
rheometer can measure the force generated to an applied deformation 

mode, or measure the deformation caused by an applied force mode 
(SHENOY, 1999). 

Rheometers can be divided into rotational and capillary types. 

The most common tests applied to polymer-powder mixtures are 
(GERMAN, 1990; SHENOY, 1999): 

i. Capillary plunger extrusion; 
ii. Capillary screw extrusion; 

iii. Rotating coaxial cylinders; 
iv. Rotating parallel plates; 
v. Torque measurements in mixing rheometers – torque 

rheometer; 

vi. Rotating cone-on-plate tests. 



80 
 

A capillary rheometer measures the pressure drop and the flow 

rate associated with the forced flow through a small capillary cylinder 
(GERMAN, 1990). Figure 20 shows the main features of a constant 

plunger speed with circular orifice capillary rheometer. 

 
Figure 20 – Schematic diagram of a 

constant plunger speed with circular orifice 
capillary rheometer.

The torque rheometer is also an instrument that allows 

rheological studies in the basis of torque measurements as a function of 
temperature, time and rotation speeds. It consists in melting the mixture 

inside a chamber and, with two rollers rotating in opposite directions, 
mix the melt measuring the torque necessary for the mixing. Different 
types of rollers, that impose different shear stresses to the mixtures, can 

be also selected. The problem of the torque rheometer is that its 
geometry and the three-dimensional nature of the flow field in the 
chamber make it difficult to evaluate rheological properties of melts 

(CHENG, et al., 2001), in a way that torque and rotation speed data 
cannot be easily converted into shear stress and shear rate, respectively. 

Another issue is that, differently from other rheometers, the mixer 

chamber of the torque rheometer is usually only partially filled – 
65~90% of the chamber volume, while 70% is a standard value 



81 

 

(CHENG, et al., 2001). The cavities present in the partial filled chamber 

influence the measurement. Figure 21 shows a schematic diagram of a 
torque rheometer chamber.

2.3.5. Mixing 

Mixing is the first step in the preparation of the feedstock for 

molding. Uniform quantities of particles and binder are needed in all 
portions of the mixture, and intensive mixing is needed to ensure that 
each interstice between the particles contains a representative 

combination of the binder components. For particulate materials 
processing it is desired that every portion of the mixture contains an 
equal concentration of powder and the same particle size distribution 

(GERMAN, 1990). 
The inhomogeneities can occur in two forms, separation of binder 

from powder, and segregation according to particle size, shape or 
density within the binder. The segregation leads to uneven densities and 
distortion of the final product. Size segregation is more problematic for 

high particle size ratios or wide particle size distributions, and in 
practice, segregation can be minimized by maintaining a high binder 
viscosity (GERMAN, 1990).  

Many indexes for mixture homogeneity have been proposed, 
including measurements of the torque and energy during mixing, shear 

modulus, viscosity, density, concentration and particle size in the 
mixture. From a rheological point of view, pseudoplastic behavior is 
associated with a well mixed system, while instability with shear rates 

relates to poorly mixed systems (GERMAN, 1990). 



82 
 

2.3.5.1. Mixing kinetics and practice 

The initial action of mixing is to break clusters by shear. With 
continued mixing, cluster size decreases and binder becomes dispersed 

between the particles (GERMAN, 1990).  
The mixing torque can be used to determine the homogeneity of 

the mixture as shown in Figure 22. Initial low torque corresponds to the 

plain binder. When the powder is added the torque increases to a high 
level. As the agglomerates break apart and the immobilized liquid is 
released the torque decreases. As more liquid is released the torque 

decreases, initially in an exponential manner. At the steady-state, i.e. no 
change in torque with time, the rate of mixing equals to the rate of 

demixing. After achieving the steady-state, any change in the mixer 
speed or temperature will cause a torque shift (GERMAN, 1990). 

 
Figure 22 – Mixing  torque as a function of 

mixing time. Steady-state torque is associated 
with mixture homogeneity. 

Source: German (1990) 

To attain homogeneity, several details must be considered in 

practice. First the temperature must be enough to both lower the 
viscosity and to reduce the yield point of the mixture. Cavitation defects 
may occur if the temperature is too low and the effects of the yield 

strength are still present. A too high temperature can degrade the binders 
or cause separation of powder from the binder (GERMAN, 1990). 

The practice of mixing should occur as follows (GERMAN, 
1990): 



83 

 

i. The binder of highest melting point is added to the 
preheated chamber; 

ii. Selectively lower temperature binders are added with 
appropriate temperature reductions when necessary, to 
avoid evaporation or degradation; 

iii. As the chamber becomes fuller, mechanical work 
increases and considerable heating may occur. 
Temperature control is important in this case; 

iv. The powder is then added. 
v. At this point the temperature may reduce drastically if 

the powder has a high heat capacity (metallic powders 

mainly); 
vi. The mixing torque, after the powder has been added, 

becomes relatively higher, because of inhomogeneities, 

interparticle friction, and decrease in temperature; 
vii. As temperature and homogeneity increases, the torque 

reduces fast; 

viii. Finally, when temperature is stable and a good level of 
homogeneity is achieved, the torque reaches a steady-

state value; 

2.3.6. Extrusion molding 

The extrusion process consists basically in pushing or forcing a 

material through an opening. Extruder die refers to the part of the 
machine containing the opening through which the material is forced. 
As the material is squeezed through the die, it acquired the shape of the 

die opening. The extruded product is referred to as the extrudate 
(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 

Extruders are the most important piece of machinery in the 

polymer processing industry, but also many different materials can be 
formed through extrusion process, e.g. metals, clays, ceramics, 

foodstuffs, etc. Materials can be extruded in the molten or in the solid 
state. Polymers are generally extruded in the molten state; nevertheless, 
the solid state extrusion can be used for some specific applications 

(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 



84 
 

2.3.6.1. Plunger extruders 

Plunger or ram extruders are simple in design, rugged and can 
only operate in a discontinuous fashion. Figure 23 shows schematically 

a plunger extruder used in powder thermoplastic extrusion. Plunger 
extruders are able to generate very high pressures (RAUWENDAAL, 
1986). 

 
Figure 23 – Sketch of a plunger extruder used in 

thermoplastic powder extrusion. 
Source: German (1990). 

This type of extruder is being used for small shot size molding 
machines and other applications that take advantage of its outstanding 

pressure generation, e.g. extrusion of ultrahigh molecular weight 
polyethylene (UHMWPE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that 
requires pressures in the order of 300 MPa (RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 

Another well known application of plunger extrusion is the solid 
state extrusion. This technique was borrowed from the metal industry, 

where solid state extrusion has been used for decades. Solid state 
extrusion consists in force the polymer through a die in a temperature 
below its melting point. This causes a drastic deformation in the 

material, which leads to an accentuated chain orientation, more effective 
than that which occurs in conventional melt extrusion. Thus 
extraordinary mechanical properties can be attained (RAUWENDAAL, 

1986). 
Apart from the extraordinarily high mechanical properties, solid 

state extrusion provides some other benefits such as (RAUWENDAAL, 
1986): 



85 

 

i. Virtually no extrudate swell occurs; 
ii. Higher surface quality and low surface friction 

coefficient can be obtained; 

iii. Polymers maintain the high tensile strength at higher 
temperatures; 

iv. Melting point of the polymer is increased with the high 
molecular orientation. 

2.3.6.2. Extrusion pressure 

Die forming is a pressure consuming, in other words, it requires 

pressure to occur. The pressure necessary for the extrusion process to 
occur depends on (RAUWENDAAL, 1986): 

i. Geometry of the flow channel; 
ii. Flow properties of the material to be extruded; 

iii. Temperature distribution in the material to be extruded; 
iv. Flow rate throw the die. 

2.3.6.3. Extrudate swell 

It is a typical phenomenon on the polymer melt extrusion process 

which consists in the swelling of the extrudate as it leaves the die, as can 
be seen in Figure 24. The responsible for this phenomenon is the 

viscoelasticity of the polymer, more precisely the elastic recover of the 
deformation through which the polymer was submitted in the die 
(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 

The amount of swelling that the extrudate undergoes depends on 
(RAUWENDAAL, 1986; CHEREMISINOFF, 1987; DEALY, et al., 
2000): 

i. Shear rate; 
ii. Polymer molecular weight. 

iii. Time during which the extrudate is held under 
deformation; 



86 
 

iv. Temperature; 

Extrudate swell is intimately related with the polymer chains 
orientation. When the extrudate undergoes higher shear rates, the 

polymer chains orient more and consequently more elastic recover can 
occur. Moreover, if a polymer has longer chains, i.e. higher molecular 
weight, elastic recover is even higher due to rearrangement of oriented 

chains, consequently, the extrudate swell is also higher 
(CHEREMISINOFF, 1987). 

The elastic recover is time-dependent, which means that it only 

occurs after a limited time subsequent to the undergone deformation. In 
other words, the deformation can be recovered to a large extent shortly 

after the occurrence of the deformation. However, after longer times the 
recoverable deformation reduces. That is the reason why short length 
dies create larger swelling than long length dies. In longer dies, a certain 

amount of relaxation occurs in the polymer structure before it leaves the 
die (RAUWENDAAL, 1986).

swelling in the die exit region. Note that the 

velocity profile changes from parabolic to 

straight.

2.3.6.4. Die flow instabilities 

The two most common flow instabilities that affect extrudate 

products are shark skin and melt fracture. 



87 

 

Shark skin is the occurrence of a mat surface. It is generally 

formed in the channel or in the die exit. The cause of the occurrence of 
this problem is related with the change in velocity profile, also shown on 

Figure 24. The main parameters that influence on the appearance of this 
defect are the temperature and the extrusion speed. Decreasing the 
extrusion speed and increasing the temperature can reduce the problem. 

Very low temperature may also reduce shark skin defects 
(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 

Melt fracture is a more severe distortion of the extrudate and can 

appear in many different forms such as the examples shown in Figure 
25. Melt fracture are not surface defect, like shark skin, but are 

associated with the whole body of the extrudate. The causes of melt 
fracture are not in agreement in the literature. But it was found to be 
reduced by controlling the temperature, extrusion speed or changing the 

die geometry (RAUWENDAAL, 1986).

ripple, (b) bamboo, (c) spiral and (d) random fracture.

2.3.7. Debinding 

Debinding is the removal of the binder. The binder should be 

extracted from the compact as a fluid – in the liquid or gas state – 
without distorting or contaminating the compact. This can be attained by 

six main different techniques that are divided into thermal debinding 
and solvent debinding (GERMAN, 1990). 



88 
 

Thermal debinding techniques are diffusion, permeation and 

wicking. Diffusion and permeating consist in heat the compact to a 
temperature high enough to cause the evaporation or degradation of the 

binder. Degradation can occur as decomposition, chain scission or 
depolymerization. If the compact has low porosity, diffusion is 
favorable, otherwise permeation occurs. Wicking is a technique in 

which the molten binder is extracted from the compact to the pores of a 
wicking substrate via capillary forces. In the wicking process the 
temperature should be enough to decrease sufficiently the viscosity of 

the binder (GERMAN, 1990). 
Solvent debinding techniques are divided into extraction, high 

pressure and thermally assisted. These techniques consist in immersing 
the compact in a fluid that is able to dissolve some of the binders. The 
solvent induce binder flow out of the compact based on the chemical 

concentration gradient. The role of the solvent debinding is to create a 
pore structure, promoting channels through which vapor of the 
remaining binder can flow in the subsequent debinding by evaporation. 

Extraction is the simple immersion in a solvent. The high pressure 
technique utilizes a supercritical in which vapor and liquid are 

indistinguishable. The thermally assisted solvent debinding uses heat to 
increase the kinetics of the process, the solvent in this case may be in the 
vapor state. Solvents commonly used include ethanol, ethylene chloride, 

trichloroethylene, pentane, methylene chloride, Freon, acetone, hexane 
and heptane (GERMAN, 1990). 

In practice two or more techniques mentioned above are 

combined to accelerate the debinding cycle. One key factor on 
debinding is to use multiple component binder system, allowing 
debinding to occur progressively in more than one step, so that after the 

removal of the first binder, another is still in a sufficient amount to hold 
the particles cohesively. Reactive atmospheres can reduce the binder 

removal time, but may also alter the particles composition (GERMAN, 
1990). 

Another relevant aspect is, when the binder is removed from the 

interstices of the particles, the compact becomes very fragile until it is 
sintered, though it must have sufficient strength to retain its shape 
(GERMAN, 1990). The compact after binder removal is often called 

brown part, in allusion with the green part after molding. 
Usually wax and oils are removed by solvent debinding. On the 

other hand, the polymers with higher molecular weights are usually 
thermally removed. Oils and waxes should be over 30 vol.% of the 
binder, to form a sufficient interconnectivity to the surface and, later, to 



89 

 

provide an interconnected porous network that allows the polymers to 

evaporate in a subsequent thermal debinding step (GERMAN, 1990). 
The last polymers to be removed form the so called backbone, and are 

the binder components that will retain the shape of the compact until the 
earlier steps of sintering. 

The debinding process is highly influenced by the permeability of 

the particles in the compact. The permeability in its turn is dependent on 
the packing density of the powder. Large particle size distributions lead 
to higher densities and decrease the permeability of the compact 

(GERMAN, 1990).  The low permeability caused by dense packing 
powders difficult the debinding process. 

During debinding, capillary forces act pulling particles together. 
If the compact is less dense than the critical loading, the liquid – molten 
binder or solvent – lubricates the surface of the particles that will 

rearrange migrating and sometimes agglomerating. As the binder is 
removed, the particles approach each other until contact each other, this, 
summed with possible residual binder, gives the compact strength. The 

removal of the residual binder can only occur by evaporation, i.e. 
thermal debinding, and must occur at the onset of sintering, since the 

compact cannot be handled once the binder is totally removed 
(GERMAN, 1990). 

High debinding rates can be achieved with thin compact sections, 

large particles, high porosity, large pressure gradients and high 
temperatures (GERMAN, 1990). 

2.3.7.1. Debinding rate and atmosphere 

High solid contents make debinding process slower due to 
reduced permeability of the binder through the denser particles packing. 
It is proved that shorter debinding times as well as better dimensional 

control is achieved using a solvent debinding step. Nevertheless all 
debinding routes end up with thermal evaporation step prior to sintering 

(GERMAN, 1990). 
Basically thermal evaporating rates depend on three factors: 

binder molecular weight, atmosphere, and temperature. Evaporating 

rates decreases with increasing molecular weight of the binder. 
Atmosphere is also a very important factor that influences debinding 
rates and the selection between oxidizing, inert or reducing atmosphere 



90 
 

must be carefully made. Temperature obviously affects directly the 

binder removal, and the rate increases with increasing temperatures 
(GERMAN, 1990). 

Oxidizing atmosphere makes debinding faster by oxidative 
degradation of the binder. The oxygen breaks the binder molecules apart 
increasing the evaporation rate. For most of metallic powders carry must 

be taken not to expose the material to oxygen at high temperatures, 
which would alter the surface chemistry of the particles, making 
sintering difficult (GERMAN, 1990). 

Inert or reducing atmosphere retards the evaporation of the binder 
as can be seen in Figure 26. The plain binder and a binder mixed with 

powder shows a different evaporating kinetics as can also be seen in 
Figure 26. 

 
Figure 26 – Cumulative binder weight loss versus 

temperature for plain polyethylene in Air and N2 

atmosphere; and polyethylene mixed with iron 
powder in N2 atmosphere. 

Source: German (1990). 

Commonly used atmospheres for thermal debinding are air, 

hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, methane and mixtures such as nitrogen-
hydrogen, hydrogen-argon, and nitrogen-hydrogen-water. Vacuum is 
also used, but is best performed in the presence of a partial pressure 

atmosphere (GERMAN, 1990). 
A problem closely related with atmosphere is residual carbon in 

the compact. The control of residual carbon is attained through selection 
of the debinding atmosphere, atmosphere flow rate. Heating rate has 



91 

 

also influence on the formation of residual carbon, however its role is 

not so clear and residual carbon can form either at low or high heating 
rates. There are evidences that show that, if the binder is not fully 

removed until debinding temperature reaches 450 °C, residual carbon 
may occur. As carbon control is not so simple, usually residual carbon is 
removed on the sintering step at higher temperatures (GERMAN, 1990). 

2.3.7.2. Debinding defects 

The most common defect is the compact deformation by viscous 
flow, caused by gravity and compact weight. Powder can flow under 

relative low stresses, leading to distortion during debinding as the 
binder, which previously retained the compact shape by bonding 
between the particles, is removed from the compact. Deformation is 

more likely to happen for larger particle sizes, low solid contents, and 
higher particle sphericity (GERMAN, 1990). 

Blisters, craters and vapor blowholes are other common 

problems. Vapor bubbles can nucleate during thermal debinding, if 
permeation or diffusion of vapor from the bubble to the surface does not 

occur, the pressure increases and displacement of particles may happen, 
leading to formation of such defects. Vapor diffusivity can decrease for 
higher packing density, which is influenced by particle size distribution, 

thicker sections, and larger particles. Blister, craters and blowholes are 
also particularly common when binder constituents are too volatile or if 
the heating rate is too fast. Entrapped air can also be a cause 

(GERMAN, 1990).  
Single component binder systems offer higher probability for the 

appearance of debinding defects, due to difficult extraction (GERMAN, 

1990). 

2.3.8. Sintering 

Sintering is a heating process that causes particles to bond 
together and develops the desired microstructure and properties 
(GERMAN, 2005; GERMAN, 1990; REED, 1995). The term sintering 

is often erroneously associated with shrinkage and densification. 



92 
 

Although this happens in most of the cases, for some materials and 

certain applications, e.g. porous materials, the products may actually be 
less dense after sintering and experience swelling instead of shrinkage 

(REED, 1995). 
Sintering triggers at one-half to two-thirds of the absolute melting 

temperature of the material. This temperature is sufficient to cause 

atomic diffusion for solid-state sintering (REED, 1995; GERMAN, 
2005). 

Microscopically, the first effects of sintering start to become 

evident in the formation of necks on the contact points between adjacent 
particles (GERMAN, 2005; GERMAN, 1990).  Figure 27 show the 

necks grown in the contact of nickel particles sintered at 1200 °C for one 
hour. 

 
Figure 27 – Scanning electron image of neck formed 

on nickel particles sintered at 1200 °C for 60 min in 
vacuum. 

Source: Plastics Today (2010). 

Sintering is a temperature-dependent mechanism, whose driving 

force is the reduction of the total Gibb’s free energy ?GT, which is the 

sum of change in the free energy associated with volume ?GV, 

boundaries ?GB, and surface area ?GS of grains, according to Equation 
15 (REED, 1995). 

Equation 15                 



93 

 

The major driving force component in sintering is associated with 

the free surface energy, which depends directly with surface area ?AS, 
according to Equation 16 (REED, 1995). 

Equation 16           

The reduction in free surface energy is only possible with atomic 
mobility. For atoms to move, they need to break the bond with neighbor 

atoms, and for that a minimum energy should be reached. The amount 
of atoms that have sufficient energy to move increases with temperature 

exponentially, thus sintering is faster for higher temperatures 
(GERMAN, 2005). 

Sintering is also faster for smaller particles, because of their 

higher surface area. (GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). 

2.3.8.1. Solid-state sintering stages 

Sintering evolves through three mains stages named initial, 

intermediate and final. Figure 28 shows schematically the evolution of 
loose spherical powder during sintering through the three stages. 

The initial stage of sintering is characterized by the formation and 
growth of several necks. In this stage pores are irregular and angular in 
shape. This process results on compact shrinkage that is about 3% on the 

initial stage (GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). 
Most of the shrinkage and densification occur during the 

intermediate stage and density reaches 92% of the theoretical value. It is 

during the intermediate stage that most of the properties development 
related with the sintering process occur. Pores develop a smoother and 

rounder or cylindrical shape and their sizes reduce gradually, but an 
interconnected pore network is present until the end of this stage 
(GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). 



94 
 

 
Figure 28 – Conceptual evolution of spherical 
particles through the three stages of sintering. 

Source: German (2005). 

The final stage is denoted by closed pores with spherical or lens 

shape and an extensive grain growth occurs. The original particles have 
lost their individuality and are no longer distinguishable. It is 

characterized by a slow kinetics, since most of the available energy from 
the excess surface free energy has been consumed during the previous 
stages. The porous are located on the grain boundaries intersections or 

inside the grain, isolated from each other (GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 
2005). 

2.3.8.2. Sintering parameters 

Sintering is a process inherently dependent on (GERMAN, 
1990): 

i. Particle size; 
ii. Initial powder packing uniformity and density; 

iii. Temperature; 
iv. Time; 



95 

 

v. Heating rate; 
vi. Atmosphere. 

The two first parameters are related with the material and 

previous process steps, while the other four are the parameters related 
with the sintering process itself. As mentioned in the previous section, 
sintering is faster for small particle sizes, as the reduction of the surface 

free energy is the driving force of the process (GERMAN, 1990). 
Powder packing uniformity and a high green density can improve 

sintering, because of the higher particle contact coordination and lower 

initial porosity. This leads to a faster sintering and lower shrinkage 
(GERMAN, 1990). 

High heating rates may cause distortion or cracks due to 
allotropic transformations or non-uniform heating in the case of thick 
sections. A fast heating may also cause retention of residual carbon 

(GERMAN, 2005). On the other hand, a too slow heating rate may 
cause grain growth due to long exposures time at high temperatures 
(COOVATTANACHAI, et al., 2010). 

Increased sintering time results in higher densities but bigger 
grain sizes (GERMAN, 1990), whereas high temperatures results in 

greater shrinkage and higher density, but also grain growth and pore 
coarsening (GERMAN, 1990). 

Atmosphere plays an important role during sintering. Common 

sintering atmospheres are: hydrogen, dissociated ammonia, water vapor, 
argon, helium, nitrogen, methane, propane, and mixtures of these gases. 
Vacuum is also often used, with or without partial pressure control. 

There are three mains aspects to be concerned with the atmosphere 
during sintering (REED, 1995; GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005): 

i. Non-soluble gas proceeding from the atmosphere can be 
trapped into closed pores refraining pore shrinkage and 
density improvement; 

ii. The partial pressure of the gases contained in the 
atmosphere may control the vaporization of elements or 
the stoichiometry of compounds in the particles; 

iii. Reactive gases from the atmosphere may reduce or 
oxidize the particles elements or compounds; 



96 
 

According to the reactivity of the atmosphere, they can be 

classified as (GERMAN, 2005): 

i. Oxidizing – carbon dioxide, water or oxygen; 
ii. Neutral – argon, helium or vacuum; 

iii. Reducing – hydrogen or carbon monoxide; 
iv. Hydriding – hydrogen, ammonia; 
v. Dehydriding – vacuum or argon; 
vi. Nitriding – nitrogen or ammonia; 

vii. Carburizing – methane or propane; 
viii. Decarburizing – carbon dioxide, or oxygen. 

Oxide ceramics are usually sintered in air, but most of the high-

performance materials require protective atmospheres, including even 
oxides. Metallic powders usually require a protective atmosphere – inert 
or reducing – to avoid oxidation (GERMAN, 1990).

3.2. METHODS 

3.2.1. Feedstock development 

Before the extrusion of the tubes, attention was given to the 
feedstock behavior during mixing, shaping and, especially, debinding. 

To develop the feedstock, no fibers were added in the mixture, so that 



100 
 

only the powders, binders and additives would influence the rheological 

behavior and debinding kinetics. 
Two main parameters of the feedstock were investigated and 

defined. The first was the filling level, i.e. solid volume content. The 
second parameter was the binder system, i.e. the types and proportions 
of binders and additives. Hereafter binder system must be considered a 

mixture of all binders and additives, regardless if a component of the 
mixture has the binder function or not. The idea was to develop a 
feedstock that could be used for both alumina and IN718 powders. As a 

starting point, preliminary tests were performed performed with a 
feedstock composed of LDPE70 and 54 vol.% of solids. 

Mixing was always carried out in the kneader adding first the 
binder with highest melting point and subsequently the binders with 
lower melting point. After all the binders were molten, the powder was 

added. The chamber effective volume was 69 cm
3
, however only 70 % 

of the volume was used, i.e. 48.3 cm
3
. The procedure was in agreement 

with the literature (GERMAN, 1990; CHENG, et al., 2001). Mixing 

occurred in 2 steps. First, a pre-mixing at 180 °C for 30 minutes, then a 
final mixing at 152 °C for 40 minutes. The rotation speed was 10 RPM 

in both steps. The first step was responsible for mixing the binder 
components and adsorbing binder to powder and breakage of fibers. The 
second step, at lower temperature and consequently higher shear stress, 

was responsible for breakage of agglomerates and fibers. 
The prepared feedstock was then granulated in a capillary 

rheometer at 140 °C through a cylindrical die with diameter of 1.0 mm 

and length of 28 mm. Granulation was performed at three different 
piston speeds, with the corresponding shear rate and granulation speed 
shown in Table 9. Granulation speed means the velocity at which the 

extrudate comes out o the die
5
. During granulation, cylinder pressure 

and piston force were measured. 

Table 9 – Granulation parameters.

 Granulation speed was calculated with a simple geometric relation between the area of the 

cylinder and the area of the die channel cross sections. By knowing the speed of the piston 

inside the cylinder was possible to calculate the speed of the extrudate on the die channel. 



101 

 

During feedstock development, no tubes were extruded. Instead, 

the feedstock granules were warm pressed into disc-shaped samples of 
28 mm of diameter. The amount of granules pressed was calculated to 

produce discs with thickness of 0.8 mm, however, due to feedstocks loss 
through the gaps between die and punchers, the thickness was slightly 
lower than that. The samples were pressed under 10 kN (corresponding 

pressure of 163.9 bar) at various temperatures, weighted and their 
densities were measured by the Archimedes method. 

Debinding of the disc samples was made in a tube furnace with 

controlled atmosphere. The debinding program was defined according to 
the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) used for the 

characterization of the binders. The following debinding atmospheres 
were used under atmospheric pressure: 

i. Reducing – forming gas (N2 + 8%H2) with a flow rate of 
0.2 l/min; 

ii. Oxidizing – air without forced flow; 

Figure 29 schematically shows the experimental procedure 

followed in the feedstock development.

development. (a) Mixing, (b) granulation, (c) warm-pressing and (d) debinding. 

  



102 
 

3.2.1.1. Filling level definition and maximum filling level 
determination 

To define the solid volume content and determine the maximum 

filling level several feedstocks, with a simple binder system, composed 
of plain LDPE, were prepared. The solids content varied between 54 and 
62 vol.%, that is roughly the same range usually used in PIM 

(GERMAN, 1990). Mixing was carried out in the kneader at 152 °C. 
To define the maximum filling level, in which viscosity 

approaches infinite, and so as the mixing torque, a relationship between 

the solids-binder ratio and the inverse of mixing torque was used. This 
method was developed in the group of Clemens and is going to be 

shown in a later section. For this method, the torque data of unfilled 
LDPE, i.e. no powder addition, was also included. To validate the 
results and the method, data was compared with different viscosity 

models. 
The following characteristics were considered during the 

definition of the filling level: 

i. Mixing torque; 
ii. Maximum filling level; 

iii. Debinding behavior. 

Mixing torque should not be too high, close to the limit of the 
kneader, because although the addition of paraffin wax in the binder 

system during binder system definition would reduce the torque, the 
fiber addition for tube extrusion would, on the contrary, increase it. 
What effect would be predominant was difficult to estimate, so that a 

safety margin should be given. The defined filling level should also be, 
obviously, below the maximum filling level (GERMAN, 1990). 

All samples were warm pressed at 140 °C under 10 kN 

(corresponding pressure of 163.9 bar). 
The debinding behavior was analyzed considering the presence of 

defects in the samples after the debinding cycle, such as deformation, 
edge rounding and blisters. 
  



103 

 

3.2.1.2. Binder system definition 

After defining the filling level, the binder system had to be 
developed. A three component binder system composed by low density 

polyethylene (LDPE), paraffin wax (PW) and stearic acid (SA) was 
used. A multi-component binder system would, according to the 
literature, permit faster debinding less prone to the formation of 

debinding defects. 
As surfactant, SA was used in a small amount, fixed in 5.0 vol.% 

of the total amount of binder, as used in many others similar PIM binder 

systems (GERMAN, 1990). So what had to be investigated was the 
volume fractions of LDPE and PW.  

Several amounts of PW content were investigated varying from 
zero to 95 vol.%. SA was used in a fix value of 5 vol.%. The balance 
was LDPE. 

The warm pressing temperature was empirically determined in a 
way that perfect discs were produced. With too low temperatures, the 
feedstock could not fill the mold properly, while with too high 

temperatures an excess of flash was produced and material was lost 
through the gap of the mould. The temperature varied from 95 to 140 

°C. Pressing was performed under 10 kN (corresponding pressure of 
163.9 bar). 

The amount of PW was defined based on the debinding behavior, 

i.e. absence of deformation, edge rounding and blisters. 

3.2.2. Tube extrusion 

After feedstock development, 30 vol.% of Nextel™ 610 fibers 

were incorporated into the solids content of feedstock, being the other 
70 vol.% alumina or IN718 powder. This amount was also fixed 
according to previous studies for other CMCs and MMCs (CHAWLA, 

2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993; MILEIKO, 1997). 
Figure 30 shows schematically the composition of the feedstock after 

binder system definition and the introduction of fibers. 



104 
 

 
Figure 30 – Schematic graphic of feedstock composition. Question marks 

denote the amount to be defined during feedstock development. 

Tube extrusion was also carried out in the capillary rheometer 

adapted with special tube production dies. Three different tube 
geometries were produced as follows: 

i. 10.0 mm of external diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness; 
ii. 10.0 mm of external diameter and 0.6 mm of thickness; 

iii. 4.5 mm of external diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. 

Figure 31 illustrates the three different tube geometries. 

 
Figure 31 – Sketch of the three different geometries of the 

extruded tubes. 



105 

 

The adapted capillary rheometer permitted the control of three 

process parameters: 

i. Cylinder temperature – ranging from temperatures under 
and above the LDPE melting temperature (108 °C); 

ii. Die temperature – also ranging from under and above 
LDPE melting temperature; 

iii. Extrusion piston speed – ranging from 0.39 to 2.00 
mm/min. 

The extrusion parameters were controlled until a perfect 

extrudate, without any visual defects, such as warping and extrudate 
fracture. After a perfect extrudate was produced, samples were analyzed 

by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to check the fiber 
alignment. 

3.2.3. Tubes debinding 

Tubes samples were cut, weighted and had their length measured 
prior to debinding. Priority was given to a simple program of thermal 
debinding. Solvent debinding would have been used only in the case of 

failure of the fully thermal debinding, i.e. appearance of debinding 
defects, such as deformation and blisters. 

Thermal debinding of the extruded tubes was performed 
according to TGA analysis of the feedstock constituents.  

3.2.3.1. Solvent debinding 

Solvent debinding was used to extract PW and SA before the 
thermal extraction of the backbone (LDPE). The samples were held in 
an ethanol bath at 60 °C for 5 hours. 

After solvent debinding, the samples were weighted to check the 
percentage of binder removed. Then a normal thermal debinding cycle 
was used to extract the LDPE. 



106 
 

3.2.4. Tubes sintering 

The tubes were sintered in the same furnace used for thermal 
debinding. All the tubes were sintered at 1300 °C for 60 minutes, with a 

heating rate of 5.0 °C/min. The temperature was chosen to provide a 
certain degree of sintering without, though, damaging the Nextel™ 
fibers that starts to degrade above 1300 °C (LEE, et al., 2003). For the 

same reason, a short period of exposure to high temperature, 60 minutes, 
was stipulated. At this temperature and time a porous structure, similar 

to those produced by WHIPOX™ process, was expected to be produced 
(CHAWLA, 2003). The following sintering atmospheres were used 
under atmospheric pressure: 

i. Reducing – forming gas (N2 + 8%H2) with a flow rate of 
0.2 l/min; 

ii. Oxidizing – air (only for CMCs) without forced flow; 

After sintering samples were weighted and, afterwards, broken 

transversally and parallelly to extrusion direction for SEM analysis. The 
samples were broken instead of cut in order to expose the fibers on the 

surface, making it easier to visualize their alignment. 

3.3. INSTRUMENTS 

3.3.1. Processing instruments 

For the feedstock production and characterization a torque 
rheometer (kneader) Thermo Scientific model Haake PolyLab OS 
RheoDrive 4 was used. The chamber volume without the rotors was 120 

cm
3
. The rotors used were Roller-Rotors R600 type, shown in Figure 32. 

With these rotors the chamber effective volume was reduced to 69 cm
3
. 

The maximum speed and maximum torque of this equipment was 250 

RPM and 160 Nm, respectively.

The disc-shaped samples were warm-pressed in a manual press 

from Paul-Otto Weber GmbH, model not specified, with a maximum 

force of 200 kN. A cylindrical die with diameter of 28.0 mm was heated 
up to pressing temperature by means of a heating band with controlled 
temperature. Figure 33 shows the die and punches used and Figure 34 

shows the setup made for warm pressing, composed by press, die, 
heating band and temperature controller.

The feedstock granulation and tube extrusion have been 

performed in a capillary rheometer from Bohlin Instruments Rosand, 
model RH7 Flowmaster, shown in Figure 35. For granulation a die with 
length of 28.0 mm, diameter of 1.0 mm and entrance angle of 0° was 

used, see Figure 36. In the case of tube extrusion dies with an entrance 
angle of 45°, with 10.0 and 4.5 mm of diameter were used. Three 
different pin diameters were used, 2.5 mm, 8.0 mm and 8.8 mm in 

combination with the two dies to produce the three different tubes 
geometries. Table 10 shows the combination of dies and pins, with the 

respective produced tubes geometries. Figure 37 shows a sketch of the

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

4.1. MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION 

The IN718 and alumina powders were characterized as received. 

Figure 39 and Figure 40 show the SEM image of the IN718 (2
nd

 batch)
6
 

and alumina powders respectively. 

 
Figure 39 – SEM images of IN718 powder in four different magnifications, 
10000, 5000, 2000 and 1000x. 

From the images is possible to see differences in morphology, 
size and particle size distribution of the two different powders. Most of 

the atomized IN718 particles have an almost perfect spherical shape,

 As the morphological characteristics of the particles of the first and second batches were 

almost identical, in the present work SEM images of only one of them were shown. 



114 
 

despite some irregular, yet rounded, particles are also present. On the 

other hand the particles of the alumina powder are overall of polygonal 
shape. Another evident difference is the mean size of the particles, 

which is larger for the IN718 powder. 

 
Figure 40 – SEM images of alumina powder in four different magnifications, 

10000, 5000, 2000 and 1000x. 

The particle size and PSD of the powders were measured by a 
laser light scattering particle size analyzer and the results can be seen in 
Figure 41 and Figure 42. Surprisingly a bimodal PSD was found for all 

the powders, being more evident on the alumina powder. The particles 
found in the submicrometric scale in the alumina powder might be an 
analysis error due to the method used (Fraunhofer diffraction), which is 

not the most adequate for ceramic particles. In the case of the metallic 
powder it is hard to say what is the reason for the detection of 

submicrometric particles. Helium pycnometry and BET analyses were 
also performed and the results are summarized in Table 11.

Figure 43 – SEM images of Nextel™ 610 alumina fibers. Magnification: 110 
and 1000 x. 

The temperature of degradation/evaporation of the binders was 
characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Samples were 

analyzed in a forming gas atmosphere, from room temperature to 600 
°C, with a heating rate of 5.0 °C/min. The results are shown in Figure 44 
to Figure 47. As it can be seen, both LDPE’s evaporate/degrade at more 

or less the same temperature range, with maximum mass loss rate at 459 
°C for LDPE70 and 470 °C for LDPE02. The LDPE’s show the higher 
extraction temperatures and are completely removed close to 490 °C. 

Paraffin wax and stearic acid show their maximum mass loss rate at 305 
and 263 °C, respectively. Above 330 °C, nearly all paraffin wax is 

removed, whereas most of stearic acid is removed at 270 °C.

4.2. PRELIMINARY TESTS 

4.2.1. Alumina and IN718 feedstocks with plain LDPE70 

4.2.1.1. Mixing 

The starting point of the study was a feedstock with 54 vol.% of 
solids a LDPE70 binder system. Figure 48 to Figure 51 show the plot of 

the torque and temperature versus time during pre-mixing and mixing of 
the nickel-based and alumina powders. The conditions of pre-mixing 
and mixing were the same for both powders, as described in the 

previous section.  
As it can be seen in Figure 48 to Figure 51, the mixing of both 

powders followed a typical behavior (GERMAN, 1990), showing first 

an increase of torque, with a decrease of temperature as the materials 
were introduced in the mixing chamber. As the temperature increased, 

either by the heating elements or by interparticle friction, the torque 
decreased until a certain homogeneity level in which both torque and 
temperature stabilized, which denotes good mixing. It can be also

during mixing, for both alumina and IN718, since the temperature 
during pre-mixing was higher than during mixing.

of both materials was quite similar, in terms of torque curve shape, the 

difference in average torque is very clear, 5.94 Nm for alumina and 3.07 
Nm for IN718. The higher torque for the alumina powder, almost twice 

higher, might be associated with the difference in powder 
characteristics, mainly particle size, PSD and powder shape (GERMAN, 
1990; SHENOY, 1999). The particle shape in this case is of great 

importance, since the polygonal shape of alumina particles offers a 
much higher inter-particle friction than the round IN718 particles 
(GERMAN, 1990). Another factor may be related with surface physics, 

e.g. wetting, which induces a different interaction powder-binder, 
causing lower or higher frictions.

4.2.1.2. Granulation 

The feedstocks have also shown a similar relation during 
granulation. Figure 53 and Figure 54 show the cylinder pressure and the 

piston force, respectively, during granulation of IN718 and alumina 
feedstocks. Each plateau corresponds to the stabilization of pressure or 
force at the three different shear rates and the corresponding granulation 

speeds. Table 12 shows the average pressure and piston force during 
granulation at the three different granulation speeds and shear rates.

Figure 55 shows the plot of the average pressure versus the shear 
rate imposed to the feedstocks. Note that both feedstocks show roughly 

the same sensitivity to the shear rate, showing nearly the same 
increment on pressure with the increase of shear rate, which means that 
the difference on morphology and PSD of the powders have virtually no 

influence on the pseudoplasticity of the feedstocks for this shear rates 
range.

The granules were then analyzed by TGA and compared with the 
TGA results of plain LDPE70. Again TGA was performed in forming 
gas from room temperature to 600 °C, with a heating rate of 5.0 °C/min. 

Figure 56 shows the TGA results of plain LDPE70, alumina-LDPE70 
feedstock and IN718-LDPE70 feedstock. A slightly higher onset 

evaporation/degradation temperature could be noticed for the IN718-
LDPE70 feedstock, probably related with the PSD of IN718 powder 
(GERMAN, 1990).

Alumina based feedstock was also analyzed in an oxygen rich 

atmosphere (air). The comparison between the TGA in the two different 
atmospheres is shown in Figure 57. It is clear the difference in kinetics 

behavior for the two different atmospheres. For an oxidizing 
atmosphere, the evaporation/degradation of the polymer occurs more 
gradually, during a larger temperature range, starting at a lower 

temperature (~250 °C) in comparison with a reducing atmosphere (~350 
°C). The difference of degradation kinetics under reducing and 
oxidizing atmosphere is in agreement with the literature (GERMAN, 

1990).

4.2.1.3. Warm-pressing 

After granulation, disc-shaped samples were produced via warm-
pressing. Figure 58 shows examples of IN718 and alumina warm-

pressed samples. Densities achieved were close to theoretical as shown 
in Table 13. The theoretical density was calculated with the densities 

and volumes of particles and binders used to produce the feedstocks, 
considering a total absence of voids. This table also shows the average 
thickness of the samples. Note that the thickness was lower than 0.8 

mm, which was the calculated thickness according to the amount of 



126 
 

granules pressed. This happened due to loss of feedstocks through the 

gaps between die and punchers.

Figure 59 and Figure 60 show the SEM images of the green

be seen that the LPDE and the powders were homogeneously 
distributed, with no segregation or clusters formation. Wetting of the 
powders by LDPE was also good.

4.2.1.4. Thermal debinding 

According to the TGA analyses of LDPE70 and the feedstocks, 
the debinding program should be carried until a temperature of at least 

500 °C. To assure the complete binder removal, a basic program was 
defined to be at 600 °C, with a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min and a dwell 
time of 60 min. The low heating rate was defined to avoid as much as 

possible the formation of blisters, without however impractically 
extending the debinding cycle. 

Debinding of alumina samples was carried out in oxidizing 

atmosphere (air) and in reducing atmosphere (forming gas), whereas 
debinding of IN718 was performed only in reducing atmosphere. The 

pictures of the samples after debinding are shown in Figure 61. As it can 
be seen, the alumina sample submitted to debinding in air has shown a 
perfect defect-free sample, with no blisters, no deformation, no warping, 

no edge rounding and no color change. On the other hand, both alumina 
and IN718 discs, submitted to debinding in reducing atmosphere, 
underwent edge rounding, deformation and blister formation. These 

defects are more likely to happen in single component binder systems, 
such as the one used (GERMAN, 1990). The alumina sample debinding 

in forming gas has shown also a slight darkening due to carburization, 
which can also be seen in the alumina support (in the picture 
background). It is presumed that IN718 samples have also undergone 

carburizing, since the binder system and debinding cycle were the same, 
however it is not visible due to the originally dark color of the IN718 
feedstock. 

       
 (a) (b) (c) 
Figure 61 – Picture of disc-shaped samples after thermal debinding. (a) Alumina 
in oxidizing atmosphere, (b) alumina in reducing atmosphere and (c) IN718 in 

reducing atmosphere. 

The difference in debinding behavior in air and in forming gas 
was somehow predicted, due to the difference observed in the TGA of 



129 

 

alumina samples showed in Figure 57. As the evaporation/degradation 

rate of LDPE70 in air is lower and happens in a larger temperature 
interval, it avoids the formation of blisters. Blisters happen when the 

rate of formation of vapor or degradation gases is faster than the rate of 
diffusion of these gases through the compact towards the surface 
(GERMAN, 1990). 

Edge rounding, on the other hand, is related with the temperature 
in which debinding starts. As shown in Figure 57, for debinding in air, 
polymer extraction starts at 250 °C, whereas for debinding in forming 

gas considerable amount of polymer starts to be extracted just at 350 °C. 
Considering a lower heating rate, 0.5 °C/min, when the material reaches 

350 °C in air, a great amount of binder, if not all of it, has already been 
removed. When the debinding is carried in reducing atmosphere, at 350 
°C nearly no binder has yet been removed and, as the viscosity of the 

binder reduces drastically with temperature, deformation and edge 
rounding at such higher temperatures is much more likely to occur. 

Moreover edge rounding and deformation is also closely related 

with the inter-particle friction. As the polygonal shape of the alumina 
particles offers a much higher inter-particle friction than the round 

IN718 particles, the IN718 samples underwent considerably higher 
deformation and edge rounding, as it can be seen in Figure 61c. 

All programs have successfully removed all the binder. For the 

debinding of the alumina sample in air, 100.00 % of binder was 
removed

7
. In forming gas, 100.00 % and 98.53 % of the binder was 

removed from the alumina and IN718 samples, respectively. 

Finally, various debinding programs were used to test the 
possibility of reducing defect formation during debinding of IN718 disc-
shaped samples. Table 14 shows the programs used and images of the 

samples afterwards. 
Program #1 shows that an oxidizing atmosphere, although 

detrimental to the metallic powder due to oxidation, reduces 
deformation and eliminates blister formation. However, edge rounding 
still occurred, which shows that this type of defect is more influenced by 

the powder characteristics. 
  

                                                         
7
 The actual values of removed binder for the alumina samples after debinding in air and in 

forming gas were 102.51 % and 101.59 %, respectively. However the maximum amount of 

binder passive to be removed is, obviously, 100.00 % and therefore this was the reported value 

for both samples.

From program #2 it is still possible to see that the amount of 

blisters reduced significantly by reducing the heating rate, which is 
coherent and expected, since the extraction gases have more time to 

diffuse through the compact, nevertheless some blisters still occurred. 
To remove them an even lower heating rate would be necessary, what 
would be impracticable; the debinding time for program #2 was already 

95 hours. 
The result of program #3 shows that a higher heating rate seemed 

not to be relevant for blister formation and deformation. The results 

were roughly the same as for the basic program. 
The idea of program #4 was to reduce the exposure time of the 

sample to high temperature before the extraction of the polymer was 
triggered, in an attempt to reduce deformation and edge rounding. This 
program seemed to be effective and deformation was reduced; however 

another type of defect occurred, and the sample showed a peeling defect. 
Finally program #5 has been made just to confirm that until 250 

°C, temperature at which debinding of PW triggers, no deformation, 

edge rounding or blisters occur. 

4.2.2. Alumina feedstock with plain LDPE02 

In order to avoid the formation of defects during debinding, an 
alumina based feedstock with a LDPE02 was investigated. The proposal 
was to check if the debinding defects, such as edge rounding, 

deformation and, eventually, blisters formation would be reduced with 
the use of a low melt flow index LDPE. 

4.2.2.1. Mixing 

Figure 62 and Figure 63 show the plot of torque and temperature 
versus time during pre-mixing and mixing of the feedstock of alumina 
powder with 54 vol.% of solids with plain LDPE02 binder. The mixing 

behavior was the same as for the feedstock with LDPE70 as binder, with 
an initial increase of torque as the temperature decrease, followed by a 

period of torque and temperature stabilization.

4.2.2.2. Granulation 

The granulation of the feedstock was carried out the same way 
and in the same conditions as previously described for the feedstocks 
using LDPE70 as binder. Figure 65 and Figure 66 show the cylinder 

pressure and the piston force, respectively, during granulation of 
LDPE02 and LDPE07 based feedstocks. Each plateau corresponds to 
the stabilization of pressure or force at the three different shear rates and 

their corresponding granulation speeds. Table 15 shows the average 
pressure and piston force during granulation at the three different 
granulation speeds and shear rates.

Figure 67 shows the plot of the average pressure versus the shear 
rate imposed to the feedstocks. Note that again both feedstocks show 

roughly the same sensitivity to the shear rate, showing nearly the same 
increment on pressure with the increase of shear rate, which means that 
both LDPE’s have the same influence on the pseudoplasticity of the 

feedstocks for this shear rates range.

4.2.2.3. Warm-pressing 

After granulation, warm-pressed disc-shaped samples were also 
produced for the alumina feedstock with LDPE02 as binder. This time, 

to achieve high densities and defect-free warm-pressed samples, a 
higher pressing temperature (148 °C) had to be used. This happened 
because of the higher viscosity (lower melt flow index) and higher 

melting point of LDPE02. Table 16 compares the characteristics of the 
warm-pressed discs of alumina with LDPE02 and LDPE70 as binder. 
What is worthy to highlight here is the higher thickness of the LDPE02 

samples. This is related with the smaller amount of feedstock slipping 
through the gaps between die and punchers during warm-pressing, 

which is another consequence of the higher viscosity of LDPE02.

4.2.2.4. Debinding 

Warm-pressed samples of alumina feedstock with LDPE70 and 

LDPE02 binders were submitted to the basic debinding program at 600 
°C, with a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min and a dwell time of 60 min, in 
forming gas. The program successfully removed 100.00 % of the binder 

in both samples, with LDPE70 and LDPE02
8
. Figure 68 shows the 

pictures of both samples after debinding. As it can be seen, the use of 
LDPE02 did not help to remove the defects found in the samples with 

LDPE70, i.e. blisters, edge rounding and deformation, and both samples 
showed apparently the same amount of such defects. The use of 

LDPE02 was thus discontinued and LDPE70, with lower viscosity 
(higher melt flow index), was the only polyethylene used as binder

 Again the real calculated values of the binder removal was 101.70 % for the sample with 

LDPE70 and 101.27 % for the sample with LDPE02.

further in this work. The selection of the LDPE with lower viscosity was 

not to reach too high pressures during the extrusion of the tubes, whose 
feedstocks would have incorporated fibers, which would by itself 

increase the extrusion pressure.

4.3. FEEDSTOCK DEVELOPMENT 

4.3.1. Filling level definition 

To define the solid volume content, alumina has been chosen to 
be the powder tested for two reasons. Firstly, an economical reason, the 

lower price and the larger amount of this powder available. The second 
reason, from an engineering point of view, was the higher viscosity of 
the alumina feedstock with 54 vol.% of solids, compared with the 

viscosity of the IN718 feedstock shown in the preliminary tests. The 
higher torque of the alumina feedstock could, eventually, limit the solid 
content to a level that the mixing torque would not exceed the 

equipment maximum permitted torque. Here it is worthy to remember 



138 
 

that both feedstocks, for alumina and IN718 powders, would have in the 

end the same characteristics, i.e. filling level and binder system 
composition. Plain LDPE70 was the only polymer used in the binder 

system for the filling level definition. 

4.3.1.1. Mixing 

The range of solids volume content tested was, as mentioned 

previously, 54, 56, 58, 60 and 62 vol.%. Figure 69 and Figure 70 show 
the plot of the torque versus time during pre-mixing and final mixing of 
the alumina powder with LDPE70. The conditions of pre-mixing and 

final mixing were the same for all filling levels as described in the 
previous section.

Figure 70 – Plot of mixing torque versus time during final mixing of alumina

The evolution of the mixing torque with increase of filling level 
occurred as expected, i.e. the higher the filling level, the higher the 

mixing torque (GERMAN, 1990). Another expected characteristic was 
the level of noise in the curves that increased for higher filling levels, 
that can be noticed clearly in the mixing curves of the feedstocks with 

60 and 62 vol.% of solids. The level of noise for increased filling levels 
is due to the increasing interaction of particles as they get closer to each 
other as the binder amount decreases. Figure 71 shows the average 

torque of the final mixing and the corresponding error bars, which are 
associated with the level of noise in the data. In Figure 70, the mixing 
torque of the feedstock with 58 vol.% has overcome the mixing torque 

of the feedstock with 60 vol.%, however, the level of noise of the latter 
may confuse the results, as shown by the error bars in Figure 71. 

Moreover, an error associated with the calibration of the machine may 
have influenced the average torque of both curves, 58 and 60 vol.%.

4.3.1.1.1. Maximum filling level calculation 

To calculate the maximum filling level the volume content ratio 

between LDPE70 and Alumina powders (LDPE/Al2O3) was plotted 
versus 1/torque, as shown in Figure 72. The extrapolation of the line to 

the point where the inverse of torque is equal to zero, i.e. torque is 
infinite, gives the minimum LDPE/Al2O3 ratio where the amount of 
Al2O3 is maximum. The minimum LDPE/Al2O3 ratio value was 

calculated with the regression equation of Figure 72. Table 17 shows the 
values of the inverse of torque and LDPE/Al2O3 ratio, including the 
extrapolated value. Using this method, the maximum filling level was 

found to be 71.4 vol.% of solids.

4.3.1.1.2. Viscosity models comparison 

From the various proposed viscosity models found in the 

literature, six among the most cited models were chosen to be compared 
with the torque data versus filling level discussed in the previous sub-
session. The chosen models were the following: 

i. Eilers’ model – Equation 9; 
ii. Mooney’s model – Equation 10; 

iii. Kriger and Dougherty’s model – Equation 11; 
iv. Frankel and Acrivos’ model – Equation 12;

v. Chong’s model – Equation 13; 
vi. Quemada’s model – Equation 14. 

Note that all these models correlate solids load and the apparent 

viscosity. In this work, no viscosity data was calculated, and the solids 
load was correlated with the mixing torque instead. It was thus assumed 
that the torque and the apparent viscosity are directly proportional for 

the feedstock in question. Moreover, for all the models the constant ?0 
had to be defined, which is the apparent viscosity of the unfilled binder. 
For that a mixing run of plain LDPE70, under the same conditions of the 

feedstock mixing, was made. The average torque for the plain LDPE70 

was 0.61 ± 0.02 Nm. In the models the maximum filling level ?m, 
calculated in the previous section, is also included. The remaining 

empirical constants of the models were arbitrarily chosen to best fit the 
results. 

Figure 73 shows the plot of the fitted models and the measured 
torque data as a function of the filling level. For low volume fractions 
(low filling levels), until approximately 0.3, all the models showed more 

or less the same behavior. From 0.3 on, Mooney’s and Quemada’s 
models exhibited a much faster torque increase with volume fraction. 
The models of Chong, Krieger-Dougherty and Eilers have shown an 

almost identical behavior. On its turn, the model of Frankel and Acrivos 
was definitely the one that best fitted the results of the present work. 

Figure 74 show a detail from the curves of Figure 73 around the volume 
fraction of the measured data, to show the fitting of the models in this 
region.

4.3.1.2. Granulation 

Granulation was performed under the same conditions as before. 
Due to high abrasion effect of the feedstock, the o-ring around the 

piston, which avoids back-flow of the feedstock during granulation 
(extrusion), has broken during granulation of all different feedstocks, 
yielding no good results. For this reason these data were not considered 

in this work. 

4.3.1.3. Warm-pressing 

Disc shaped samples, with filling levels varying from 54 to 62 

vol.%, were warm-pressed at 140 °C. Table 18 summarizes the 
characteristics of the produced discs.

4.3.1.4. Debinding 

The samples with different filling levels were submitted to the 

basic debinding program. The program successfully removed 100.00% 
of the binder

9
 in samples with filling level from 54 to 60 vol.%; the 

sample with 62 vol.% of solid had 99.70 % of the binder removed. 

Figure 75 shows the pictures of the samples after debinding. As it can be

 The real calculated values were 100.53, 101.10, 100.20 and 100.25 % for the samples with 

54, 56, 58 and 60 vol.% of solids, respectively.

seen, the filling level did not have any influence on the blisters. 

However, with increasing of filling level, edge rounding has been 
significantly improved. The sample with 62 vol.% of solids showed no 

edge rounding. Based on these results, the filling level was defined to be 
62 vol.% for further studies in the present work. This value is also much 
lower than the calculated maximum filling level (71.4 vol.%), which is 

good to avoid amplified volume errors due to weighting errors 
(GERMAN, 1990), as shown in Figure 16. The optimal filling level 
should have 2 to 5 vol.% less powder than the maximum filling level 

(GERMAN, 1990); however, as fibers would be introduced in the 
system afterwards, and the high aspect ratio of the fibers would decrease 

the maximum filling level (GERMAN, 1990), it was decided to keep the 
filling level at 62 vol.%, which is about 9.6 vol% lower than the 
calculated maximum filling level.

4.3.2. Paraffin wax content definition 

To define the paraffin content, feedstocks with alumina and 
IN718 powders were prepared with binder systems composed by 5.0 

vol.% of stearic acid and different amounts of paraffin wax, with the 
balance of LDPE70. The PW volume contents tested are shown in Table 
19 and Figure 76.

Figure 79 shows the evolution of mixing torque with the PW 

volume content. As it can be seen, the influence of PW on the mixing 
torque is very high, and with 20 vol.% the mixing torque, for both 

alumina and IN718 feedstocks, have drop to roughly one third of the 
torque without PW. The torque keeps decreasing fast with addition of 
PW until an amount of 47.5 vol.%, i.e. LDPE/PW ratio equals to unit. 

After that, the feedstock viscosity is approximately the same as a 
feedstock composed only of PW (95 vol.%) and SA (5 vol.%). 

 
Figure 79 – Evolution of mixing torque with increase of PW volume content 

and corresponding decrease of LDPE70 content. The amount of SA was fixed in 

all binders at 5 vol.%. 

4.3.2.2. Granulation 

The granulation of the alumina and IN718 feedstocks was 
performed such as previously done for the feedstocks with plain 
LDPE70. Nevertheless the granulation pressures were too low, lower 

than the measuring range of the pressure transducers. For this reasons, 
this data were not explored.

4.3.2.3. Warm-pressing 

The decrement of viscosity with the addition of PW has had a 
very high effect on the facility of the feedstock to flow from the warm-

pressing die, through the gaps between punchers and die. For this reason 
the warm-pressing of the feedstocks containing SA and PW was carried 
in lower temperatures compared with the feedstocks with plain LDPE. 

Table 20 summarizes the characteristics of the produced warm-pressed 
discs, as well as their pressing temperature.

4.3.2.4. Thermal debinding 

Alumina and IN718 warm-pressed discs with the different binder 
systems, summarized in Table 20, were submitted to the basic thermal 

debinding program in forming gas atmosphere. Table 21 shows the 
percentage of binder removed from all discs. As it can be seen, the 
debinding process successfully removed almost all the binder of the 

discs. A lower percentage of binder removal from the IN718 discs may 
be attributed to a slight oxidation of the samples, which increases the 
weight of the metallic powder. The weight increment input an error in 

the calculation of the binder removal percentage that is made by 
weighting of the samples. This explains the lower binder removal value 

of the IN718 sample with 47.5 vol.% of PW. For this sample, the o-ring 
that seals the furnace probably have not been correctly positioned, 
allowing more oxygen entering the furnace and contaminating the 

atmosphere.

IN718 discs with different binder systems.

Figure 82 and Figure 83 show the discs after the debinding 

process. As it can be seen, the introduction of PW and SA in the binder 
system solved the problem of blister formation. This happened because 
the removal of binder occurred in two steps. First, the SA and PW were 

removed at temperatures around 260 and 300 °C, respectively, leaving a 
porous structure behind that allows the free flow of LDPE degradation 



152 
 

gases, which are produced in the second step of the thermal debinding, 

at temperatures around 460 °C. 
It can also be seen that the minimum amount of PW for alumina 

and IN718 feedstocks is different, 25 vol.% for the alumina feedstock 
and 30 vol.% for IN718 feedstocks. Below these values blisters starts to 
disrupt on the surface of the samples. The different limits of PW content 

are correlated with the difference in powder morphology and PSD 
which leads to a different powder packing factor (GERMAN, 1990), 
probably denser for the IN718 powder. Denser packing makes 

debinding slower for the IN718 powder, which makes the samples of 
this powder more prone to blister formation. With this results the PW 

volume content has being defined to 30 vol.% of the binder system, so 
that both alumina and IN718 show no blister formation during 
debinding. This result is in agreement with what is found in the 

literature, which states that a minimum of 30 vol.% of low molecular 
binder should be used to form a sufficient interconnected network, 
alloying efficient solvent debinding, which could later provide an 

interconnected porous network for the subsequent thermal debinding 
(GERMAN, 1990).

4.3.3. Ultimate extrusion feedstock 

With the results of the two previous sections the extrusion 
feedstock was defined to be as shown graphically in Figure 84. For the 
ultimate extrusion feedstocks 30 vol.% of Nextel™ 610 fibers were 

incorporated in the solids content. 

 
Figure 84 – Schematic graphic representing the ultimate extrusion feedstock 

composition. 

4.3.3.1. Mixing 



154 
 

Figure 85 and Figure 86 show the pre-mixing torque of the 

ultimate alumina and IN718 feedstocks with Nextel™ fibers. For both 
feedstocks, the pre-mixing curves show a different behavior than 

previously observed for the feedstocks without fibers. This can be seen 
in the stabilization time that is much longer, with a torque decrease 
during almost all pre-mixing time. This is associated with fiber breaking 

during mixing, i.e. as the fibers break and have their average length 
decreased, the mixing torque decreases correspondently. 

Figure 87 and Figure 88 compare the final mixing torque of the 

feedstocks with and without fibers, for alumina and IN718 feedstocks, 
respectively. The compared feedstocks have the same binder system, i.e. 

65 vol.% of LDPE, 30 vol.% of PW and 5 vol.% of SA. As expected, 
the feedstocks with fibers show higher mixing torque than their 
correspondent feedstocks without fibers. Nevertheless this effect was 

more evident for the IN718 feedstocks, for which the mixing torque has 
almost doubled and remained higher after mixing for 40 minutes. 

For the alumina feedstock, the mixing torque started higher, 

however, fiber breakage has still occurred during final mixing, leading 
to a torque decrease until the end of mixing. In the end the mixing 

torque of the alumina feedstocks with and without fibers were nearly the 
same. It seems that the particle-particle friction and particle-fiber 
friction are of the same magnitude when the fibers break to shorter 

lengths. This effect that is observed for the alumina feedstock but not for 
the IN718 feedstock may be related with the powder composition, but 
also with the powder morphology and particle size distribution, which 

are all different comparing both powders. 
Nevertheless it should be also emphasized that the mixing torque 

of the feedstock without fiber has also shown an unusual increase of 

mixing torque during the last minutes, what cannot be clearly explained 
and this contributes to the equalization of torque for the feedstocks with 

and without fibers. Normally a feedstock should show a thixotropic 
behavior (GERMAN, 1990), i.e. exhibits a decrease in shear stress with 
time at constant shear rate, but in this case a rheopectic behavior has 

been observed.

Figure 89 and Figure 90 show the TGA results of the ultimate 

alumina and IN718 feedstocks with fibers. The analyses were performed 
in forming gas atmosphere, from room temperature up to 600 °C, with a 

heating rate of 5 °C/min. Both curves, for alumina and IN718 powders, 
are nearly the same showing no influence of the different powders on 
the kinetics of binder thermal extraction. The low molecular weight 

binders, SA and PW, were extracted before, at the temperature range 
from 200 to 300 °C. As the extraction temperature range of both SA and 
PW are nearly the same, no separation of the extraction peaks was 

noticeable, which means that they were extracted simultaneously. The 
remaining binder, LDPE, that correspond to 65.46 wt.% was extracted at 

temperatures above 400 °C.

4.3.3.2. Granulation 

The attempt to granulate the feedstocks with fibers has not been 
successful. Fibers have clogged the narrow orifice of the granulation 

die, which had 1.0 mm of diameter. Thus rough chopped feedstock has 
been used for the warm-pressing of discs. 

4.3.3.3. Warm-pressing 

Table 22 shows the characteristics of warm-pressed discs of 
alumina and IN718 feedstocks with fibers. Pressing temperatures were 
the same used for the correspondent feedstocks without fibers. As it can 

be seen, the fiber content has not interfered negatively in the pressing 
process, allowing high densities to be achieved. The theoretical density

The warm-pressed samples have been submitted to the basic 

debinding program in forming gas atmosphere. The program 
successfully removed 95.10 % and 96.95 % of the binder for the IN718 
and alumina samples, respectively. The remaining binder is expected to 

be carburized at higher temperatures during the sintering step. Figure 91 
shows the pictures of the samples after the debinding process. Again no 
blisters, deformation or edge rounding have been observed. Such result 

indicates that the fibers do not play a significant role in the debinding 
mechanism.

4.4. TUBES EXTRUSION 

The extrusion of tubes has been performed with the ultimate 
alumina and IN718 feedstocks developed and showed in the previous 

sections. The following sections describe the approach to achieve 
uniform and visually defect-free tubes produced via extrusion. As 
mentioned before, extrusion was carried out in a capillary rheometer 

adapted with tube extruding dies in three different configurations, 
allowing the production of three different tube geometries. 

As the extrusion equipment was relatively simply built, only two 

parameters could be controlled, namely cylinder temperature and piston 
speed. A third parameter, die temperature, has also been investigated, 

however, no electronic automated control was originally built in the 
machine, and a cooling setup with the use of a refrigerant fluid, has been 
adapted, which has given the die temperature two states, cooled and not 

cooled. The control of these three parameters, which is going to be 
discussed in the following sections, was the most important aspect on 
the extrusion optimization, and has been done mainly in an empirical 

way. 

4.4.1. Cylinder temperature control 

The cylinder temperature has been set in six different 
temperatures: 90, 95, 100, 110, 120 and 140 °C. Considering the melting 
point of the high molecular polymer, LDPE70, that is 108 °C, the 

temperature varied from below to above the melting point of this 
polymer, which is the backbone of the system. Thus the tubes were 
extruded in the solid and molten states. The solid state extrusion is of 

industrial practice and is only possible with plunger type extruders 
(RAUWENDAAL, 1986), with a configuration similar to the adapted 
capillary rheometer used in the present work. 

With this temperature variation, differences were expected on the 
surface finishing of the tubes, as well as some deformation and, of 

course, differences on extruding pressures. During the control of 
cylinder temperature, no die cooling has been applied and the piston 
speed was fixed at 1.0 mm/min. 

The first aspect noticed was that there was no possibility to 
extrude the tubes at 140 °C. The viscosity of the feedstock in the exit of 



161 

 

the die was so low at such high temperature, that the tubes were 

collapsing, and any attempt to improve the process, reducing for 
example the extruding speed, was useless. So without controlling the die 

temperature, extrusion was only possible at low temperatures, close to 
the melting point of the backbone. 

The second aspect observed was that the cylinder temperature 

affects tremendously the extrusion pressure. Figure 92 shows the 
influence of cylinder temperature on extruding pressure for alumina 
tubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of wall thickness, with 

piston speed of 1.00 mm/min. The figure shows that the pressure 
decreases drastically with increasing temperatures. Very low pressures, 

below 1.0 MPa, could be achieved at temperatures above the melting 
point of the backbone polymer. The low pressures reflect the very low 
viscosity of the feedstock at such temperatures, which makes difficult 

the maintenance of extrudate shape once it exits the die. Moreover low 
pressures imply low shear rates that could possibly not be sufficient to 
align the fibers properly.

tubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of wall thickness. Piston speed: 

1.00 mm/min. 

Making use of Equation 5 and adjusting the activation energy E, 
it was possible to fit the curve generated by the equation with the 
experimental data in the Arrhenius plot of Figure 93. The equation

correlates viscosity with temperature, however, it fitted quite well the 

experimental data, which correlates extrusion pressure with temperature. 
The activation energy of the feedstock, also shown in Figure 93, was 

much higher than that of the plain binder, which are 4.4 kJ/mol for PW 
and 19.0 kJ/mol for PE (GERMAN, 1990). This is because of the 
difference in the thermal expansion of the binders and particles, which 

makes the feedstock much more thermal sensitive than the unfilled 
binders (GERMAN, 1990).

versus the inverse of extrusion temperature T. The measured data are from the 

extrusion of alumina tubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of wall 
thickness with a piston speed of 1.00 mm/min. 

Extruding temperature also showed to be an important parameter 
regarding the surface visual aspect of the tubes. Temperatures above 120 

°C, which is above the melting point of the backbone, have yielded 
tubes with rough surface and banana shape (warping). Figure 94 shows 
examples of tubes extruded at high temperatures with such defects.

On the other hand, extrusion at temperatures below or close to the 
melting point of the backbone resulted in tubes with polished surface, 
however with two other surface defects: (a) fish scale, also known as 

bamboo (RAUWENDAAL, 1986), and (b) stains, which are similar to 
the surface defect known as shark skin, associated with both extrusion 

temperature and speed (RAUWENDAAL, 1986). Figure 95 show 
examples of these two defects proceeding from extrusion at low 
temperatures.

4.4.2. Die temperature control 

As already mentioned, the equipment used in this work had no 
die temperature control. Without any cooling, the die achieved roughly 

the same temperature of the cylinder. As showed in the previous section, 
no matter what temperature of the cylinder has been used, tubes with 
different defects have been produced and no defect-free product has 

been achieved this way. 
To solve this problem, a refrigerant fluid has been used to cool 

down the die. For that, a beaker full of fluid was positioned right under 

the die exit, in a way that the refrigerant fluid was in permanent contact 
with the die, just as it is shown in Figure 96. Water and ethanol have 

been chosen as refrigerants, being the former used exclusively with 
alumina tubes and the latter for both alumina and IN718 tubes, to avoid 
oxidation of the nickel alloy in water. 

      
 (a) (b) 
Figure 96 – Pictures of die cooling setup showing: (a) the refrigerant fluid 
(ethanol) inside the beaker in contact with the extrusion die to reduce its 

temperature; and (b) detail of the die submerged in the ethanol bath and the 

alumina extrudate exiting the die. 

With this setup it was possible to cool the lower part of the die 

down to the boiling temperature of the chosen refrigerant fluid, i.e. 100 



165 

 

°C for water and 78 °C for ethanol. So what has been done was to set 

the cylinder to high temperature, i.e. above melting point of LDPE, and 
cool the die end with the refrigerant. 

Although using the die cooling setup the die end could be kept at 
a temperature close to the boiling point of water or ethanol, the die 
entrance had still roughly the same temperature of the cylinder. This 

means that the feedstock was being shaped into the die in the molten 
state, and only in the very end of the die, where no more shape change 
was imposed to the feedstock, the extrudate was cooled down below the 

melting point of the backbone, but still inside the die. With this the 
surface finishing of the extrudate should be the same as the surface 

finishing of the die walls, in a process close to solid state extrusion, in 
which a much better surface quality is also attained (RAUWENDAAL, 
1986). Moreover, an increase in pressure has been experienced with the 

use of the die cooling setup, related the higher friction between the 
solidified extrudate and the die walls. Higher pressures lead to a more 
compacted extruded structure, with higher particle contact, which 

increases the shape stability, especially during debinding and sintering. 
On the other hand a more compacted extruded structure may also have 

residual stresses that would be detrimental to shape maintenance during 
reheating. 

The results seemed much better with the use of this setup, even 

allowing the temperature of the cylinder to be set as high as 140 °C, 
what was impracticable without cooling the die. Some results can be 
seen in Figure 97. The tubes produced without the use of the die cooling 

setup have a rough surface and show a banana shape deformation, 
defects that are solved with the use of the cooling setup.

tubes have 10.0 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. 

4.4.3. Piston speed control 

The influence of piston speed on extrusion pressure is shown on 

Figure 98. As it can be seen the pressure inside the cylinder increases 
more or less proportionally with the increase of piston speed until a 
piston speed of 2.00 mm/min. Above this speed the pressure seems not 

to increase relevantly, which may be related with the shear thinning 
behavior (pseudoplasticity) of the feedstock.

Figure 98 – Plot of extrusion pressure versus piston speed of 
IN718 tubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of wall 

thickness extruded at 120 °C using the die cooling setup with 

ethanol. 

The influence of piston speed on the extrudate has shown to be on 

both surface finishing and shape maintenance. Extrusion speed is 
directly proportional to the piston speed. It was observed that the lower 
the extrusion speed, the better is the surface and lower is the curvature 

of the banana shape defect. 
To make it clear, piston speed is the velocity with which the 

piston presses the feedstock against the die during the extrusion process. 

Piston speed is set by the operator and controlled automatically by the 
device. Extrusion speed is the velocity with which the feedstock is 

extruded, i.e. the velocity of tube production, and depends on the piston 
speed, piston section area and die section area. Larger die section areas 
allow higher volumes of material to be extruded, producing thus, for a 

certain piston speed, lower extrusion speeds. Smaller die section areas 
allow lower volumes of materials to be extruded, producing, for the 
same piston speed, higher extrusion speeds. 

A simple geometric analysis was used to estimate the extrusion 
speed as a function of piston speed. No extrudate swell or viscoelastic 

behavior of the feedstock was included in the calculation, which gives 
only an approximate value as a reference. 

The volume of feedstock displaced by the piston VP depends on 

the piston speed vP, piston section area AP and time t, according to 
Equation 17.

Equation 17             

In the same way, the extruded volume VE depends on the 
extrusion speed vE, die section area AD and time t, according to Equation 

18. 

Equation 18            

But the extruded feedstock volume VE is equivalent to the 
feedstock volume displaced by the piston VP: 

Equation 19       

So, substituting Equation 17 on Equation 18: 

Equation 20                  

Then vE is given by: 

Equation 21    
     

  
 

Equation 21 shows that the extrusion speed vE is directly 
proportional to the piston speed vP and inversely proportional to the die 

section area AD. The calculated section areas of the piston and the dies 
are given in Table 23.

For the quality of the extrudate, what really matters is the 

extrudate speed vE. With a piston speed vP of 1.00 mm/min it was 
possible to produce defect-free tubes with the die of 10.0 mm of 

diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness, as shown before in Figure 97. 
However, using the same piston speed for the other two dies, fish scale 
and banana shape defects were evident on the tubes, as it can be seen in 

Figure 99.

All tubes were produced with the use of the die cooling setup with ethanol as 
refrigerant. 

The defects shown in Figure 99 (a), (b) and (d) were produced 
due to the high extrusion speed imposed to the tubes. Applying Equation 

21 the extrusion speed vE is calculated for the three different dies 
geometries, using a piston speed vP of 1.00 mm/min. The results are 
shown in Table 24.

As defect-free tubes could be produced with a vE of 15.7 mm/min 

for the die of 10.0 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness, it was 
expected to produce defect-free tubes also with the other two dies at the 
same vE. Table 25 shows the calculated vP for the dies to produce a vE of 

15.7 mm/min.

Extruding tubes with any of the three dies using up to a maximum

4.4.4. Ultimate extrusion conditions 

After several extrusion trials, to study the control of the 
parameters described in the three previous sub-sections, the ultimate 

extrusion conditions have been defined as follows: 

i. Cylinder temperature – 120 °C; 
 

ii. Die temperature – using the die cooling setup with 
ethanol; 
a. Die entrance – 120 °C (cylinder set temperature); 
b. Die exit – 78 °C (ethanol boiling point); 
 

iii. Extrusion speed – 15.7 mm/min; 
a. Die of 10.0 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness 

– Piston speed of 1.00 mm/min required; 

b. Die of 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of thickness 
– Piston speed of 0.61 mm/min required; 

c. Die of 4.5 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness 
– Piston speed of 0.39 mm/min required; 

Figure 101 show the tubes produced under the above ultimate 

extrusion parameters. It can be seen that tubes with high length/diameter 
ratio could be extruded. Tubes longer than 15 cm were not produced due 
to mere limitation of the ethanol beaker height.

No extruded tube showed the effect of extrudate swell. According 
to what could be found in the literature, the reasons for this phenomenon 
not to occur are the following: 

i. Low die-end temperature – as the die end is at a 
temperature below the melting point of the backbone, 
which is the main binder of the system, its molecules are 

already with too low mobility by the time the extrudate 
leaves the die. This is what happens in solid state 

extrusion, which also shows virtually no extrudate swell 
(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 

ii. Low extrusion speed – molecular alignment is associated 
with high shear rates, which on its turn happens under 
high extrusion speeds. With low degree of alignment of 
the molecules, a lower elastic recover shall occur 

(CHEREMISINOFF, 1987). Moreover, even if the 
molecules could have been sufficiently aligned, the long 

residence time inside the die avoided the elastic recover 
that is time-dependent and can only occur after a limited 
time subsequent to the undergone deformation 

(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). 



174 
 

iii. Low molecular weight binders – the considerable amount 
of PW and SA, which are binders with short chains, must 
have diminished the amount of extrudate swell which is 

proportional to molecule length (CHEREMISINOFF, 
1987). 

iv. Nextel™ fibers content – the alumina fibers, which have 
a relative high rigidity, could have also worked as 
anchors, refraining the elastic recover. 

Figure 102 and Figure 103 show the SEM images of the 

longitudinal section of the alumina and IN718 green tubes, respectively. 
In the images, it can be seen the good fiber alignment of the Nextel™ 

fibers in the direction of extrusion. This evidence shows that the shear 
rate was high enough to produce fiber alignment, although it was not 
sufficient to align the molecules.

A good distribution of particles along both the longitudinal and 

transversal sections can be seen, which indicates low level of 
agglomeration or segregation. The samples have been broken 

transversally, to avoid fiber cutting that would happen using any cutting 
instrument. In Figure 103b, it can be seen the original sites of fibers that 
have been pulled out during sample breakage. Note that at these sites 

some particles emerge from the binder, indicating that, before 
debinding, good particle-particle and particle-fiber contact already 
existed due to the high filling level used (62 vol.%). Another important 



175 

 

fact observed in the SEM images is that the fibers, once 30 mm long, 

have been broken during kneading down to lengths of approximately 0.5 
mm.

4.5. TUBES DEBINDING AND SINTERING 

In this section the steps of debinding and sintering were put 

together for a reason. With the disc-shaped samples it was noticed that, 
after debinding at 600 °C, the green strength of the samples was too low 
for any handling. Every attempt to handle the samples and remove them 

from the alumina support has resulted on sample fracture. Thus, to avoid 
any tube fracture, all the samples have been sintered directly after 
thermal debinding. 

The sintering program for all samples was from 600 to 1300 °C, 
with a heating rate of 5 °C/min and a dwell time of 60 min at 1300 °C. 

4.5.1. Thermal debinding and sintering without previous solvent 
debinding 

As the warm-pressed discs have presented good results with fully 

thermal debinding, the first approach for tube debinding was a simple 



176 
 

thermal cycle. So just like the warm-pressed samples, the tubes were 

submitted to the basic thermal debinding program and subsequently 
sintered at 1300 °C in forming gas atmosphere. 

The thermal debinding and sintering program has successfully 
removed 100.47 ± 3.31% of the binder of the alumina tubes

10
. In the 

case of IN718 tubes, a mass gain apparently due to oxidation, 

carburization or even nitriding, has disguised the effect of binder 
removal, so that the calculated binder removal by weight loss was only 
of 59.95 ± 6.18%, which might not be true and a value close to 100% 

would be the reality. The hypothesis of oxidation is going to be 
discussed further on.

 The maximum expected value of binder removal was 100.00%, however, due to error 

associated with weighting and sample mass loss on handling, this value can exceed 100.00%. 



177 

 

Figure 104 and Figure 105 show pictures of tubes after the 

debinding and sintering programs. All samples have undergone 
unacceptable deformation. The IN718 tubes have undergone the most 

severe deformation, collapsing completely. 
Alumina tubes were also submitted to thermal debinding and 

sintering in air. But the results were not better, as it can be seen in 

Figure 106. The measured binder removal in this case was 98.11 ± 
0.90%. Again the tubes have undergone deformation, except the tube 
with 4.5 mm of diameter (c), that seemed to have undergone no 

deformation. Nevertheless these results were unacceptable and to solve 
the problem a solvent debinding step was proposed.

The dark edges of tubes (a) and (b) are contamination originated from the 

cutting disc. The curvature of the tube (c) is not related with the debinding and 
sintering, but was already present on the green tube. 

4.5.2. Solvent debinding followed by thermal debinding and 
sintering 

In order to diminish the deformation during thermal debinding, 
the samples were submitted to a cycle of solvent debinding. Ethanol 

heated at 60 °C was used as solvent. The samples were submerged in 
ethanol bath for 5 hours. Solvent debinding was able to remove 90.96 ± 
4.35 % and 92.44 ± 3.17 % of the low molecular weight binders of the 

alumina and IN718 tubes, respectively.  
Samples of the tubes after solvent debinding were analyzed via 

SEM. The comparative images are shown in Figure 107 and Figure 108. 



178 
 

The microstructure of the alumina tubes after solvent debinding did not 

have significant alterations, except some channels that seem to have 
appeared after solvent debinding, but are somewhat confused with some 

cracks originated during the transversal breakage of the sample. On the 
other hand, for the IN718 tubes, a noticeable difference on the 
microstructure is evident and a more porous structure is observed after 

solvent debinding. This shows that solvent debinding was fulfilling its 
role on letting a porous structure with channels, allowing the backbone 
polymer to be easily extracted by thermal evaporation/degradation.

 (a) (b) 
Figure 108 – SEM images of extruded IN718 tubes (a) before solvent debinding 
and (b) after solvent debinding. Magnification: 5000x. 

After solvent debinding, the samples were submitted to thermal 
debinding and sintering the same way as in the previous section. The 



179 

 

alumina tubes submitted to thermal debinding and sintering in forming 

gas had 97.58 ± 2.30% of the binder removed. The IN718 tubes had 
again the same problem of weight gain previously discussed, most 

probably due to oxidation, carburization or nitriding, and the calculated 
value of binder removal, which might be false, was only 60.46 ± 4.02%. 
Alumina tubes were also submitted to thermal debinding and sintering 

under air atmosphere and had 100.22 ± 4.09% of the binder removed
11

. 
Figure 109 and Figure 110 show pictures of alumina and IN718 

tubes after solvent debinding, thermal debinding and sintering in 

forming gas. Figure 111 shows pictures of alumina tubes after thermal 
debinding and sintering in air atmosphere. As it can be seen, solvent 

debinding was indeed helpful on avoiding deformation during thermal 
debinding. All the alumina tubes, submitted to thermal debinding and 
sintering, both in forming gas and air atmosphere have undergone no 

deformation. 
In the case of the IN718 tubes, only the smallest tube, with 4.5 

mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness, has not deformed during 

thermal debinding and sintering. The tube with 10.0 mm diameter with 
thicker wall (1.0 mm thick) shows a much lower deformation comparing 

with the sample without solvent debinding, but still a certain amount of 
deformation is evident. The tube with thinner wall (0.6 mm thick) has 
deformed considerably more than the thicker one. In fact the sphericity 

of the IN718 particles, which is much higher than the alumina particles, 
makes the tubes of the former much more likely to undergo deformation 
during thermal debinding (GERMAN, 1990). 

Another reason for the deformation during thermal debinding 
could be related with the too low evaporation/degradation temperature 
of the backbone (around 450 °C). At this temperature, virtually no neck 

was formed before the last LDPE molecules were removed. Efficient 
thermal debinding should allow the backbone to be removed at the onset 

of the sintering temperature of the powder, so that sintering necks would 
provide strength to the compact before the backbone is completely 
removed (GERMAN, 1990). Nevertheless this is only possible with low 

temperature metallic alloys. For refractory alloys, such as nickel 
superalloys, and ceramics, the onset of sintering temperature is far 
beyond the degradation temperature of the available polymers.

contamination originated from the cutting disc. 

Some attempts have been made to diminish the deformation of 
IN718 tubes by means of changing the thermal debinding program. 
Faster heating rates trials have been made under the reasoning that 

holding the sample longer times above the melting point of the 
backbone would produce higher deformation. Besides, at higher heating 
rates, the binder removal should happen at higher temperatures, shifting 

the thermal debinding to temperatures closer to the onset of sintering, so 
that neck formation would increase the stability of the compact 

(GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). 
Table 26 shows the different programs tried and the picture of the 

samples after the tests. No program has succeeded. For test #3 the 

heating rate has been increased only on the beginning of the heating 
ramp, avoiding the unnecessarily long exposure time above the melting 
point of LDPE and below the extraction temperature range. Above 350 

°C, when the LDPE started to be extracted, the heating rate was 
decreased to the standard 0.5 °C/min. This program has also failed, 

making it evident that a faster program would not help, and the 
deformation was increasing with the increase of heating rate. A slower 
heating rate could have solved the problem, but it was operationally 

impracticable.

4.5.3. Sintered tubes characterization 

4.5.3.1. SEM analysis 

Figure 112 and Figure 113 show the SEM images of alumina and 

IN718 tubes after sintering at 1300 °C for 60 min. These tubes have 4.5 
mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. At this sintering temperature 
and time, some sintering necks were expected on both alumina and 

IN718 particles. The necks on the alumina particles are not visible with 
this magnification, but they were presumably formed, as the resistance 
to fracture of the samples has increased considerably and were not 

breakable by hand. Analytical mechanical resistance tests were not 
performed due to lack of measurable samples. In the case of the IN718 

sample, the necks are noticeable, though very small. 
Sintering at 1300 °C for 60 minutes was not enough, as would 

suggest the literature (JOHNSON, et al., 2004; CALOW, et al., 1972), 

being necessary higher sintering temperatures or times to allow neck 
growth. It seems that no neck formation occurred between the particles 
and the fibers for both alumina and IN718 powders. Moreover the fibers 

might have refrained the shrinkage of the compact, and consequently 
avoided neck growth in both cases. Additionally, the oxidation of the 

nickel based powder also restrained sintering.

4.5.3.2. XRD analysis 

Figure 114 shows the XRD analysis results of the sintered and 
green tubes of alumina. Peaks of alpha alumina crystal, originated from 

the alumina powder and Nextel™ fibers, were identified along with 
peaks of (CH2)x, originated from PW and LDPE of the binder. No 
significant difference was indentified between the three XRD patterns, 

excepting the peaks of (CH2)x found in the green tube. It may also have 
occurred an increase in crystallinity of the sintered tubes in comparison 

with the green tube, which can be noticed on the slightly narrowing of 
the peaks on the sintered samples. However this difference can also be 
mere sampling error. No difference at all could be noticed between the 

tubes sintered in air and in forming gas. 



185 

 

 
Figure 114 – XRD analyses of green and sintering alumina tubes. Sintering 

atmospheres: forming gas and air. 

Figure 115 shows the XRD results for the green and sintered 
IN718 tubes. On the green sample peaks of alpha alumina crystals, 
originated from the Nextel fibers, were identified along with peaks of 

FeNi alloy, originated from the IN718 powder and related with the two 
main elements of the alloy. Not surprisingly, on the sintered XRD 
pattern two other peaks were identified, chromium nitride (Cr2N) and 

iron oxide (Fe0.902O). The abundant nitrogen from the forming gas 
atmosphere reacted with chromium, which is one of the most important 

alloying element (18.5%) of the IN718 nickel superalloy; the reaction 
product was stable chromium nitride. On the same way, oxygen 
contamination in the atmosphere has oxidized iron, the most abundant 

alloying element of IN718 (18.9%). The oxygen may have been 
adsorbed on the walls of the furnace. Oxygen may also have entered the 
furnace during sintering, because the sealing of the furnace was not 

efficient, and gaps were sometimes detected. 
The spinel phase (NiAl2O4), expected to be formed in the alumina 

and IN718 interfaces (CALOW, et al., 1971; SURESH, et al., 1993; 
MILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et al., 2002a), has not been detected in the 
XRD analysis.

Figure 115 – XRD analysis of green and sintered IN718 tubes. Sintering 

atmosphere: forming gas. 

In order to investigate the influence of the alumina fibers on the 
sintering of IN718 based tubes, a sample of IN718 without fiber has also 
been analyzed by XRD after sintering. The comparative results are 

shown in Figure 116. Niobium and Niobium carbide (NbC) peaks have 
been identified in the sample without fibers, showing that carburizing 
was also another effect on the sintering conditions of the present work. 

Niobium is another important alloying element of the superalloy (5.0%) 
and reacted with carbon proceeding from the binders. Carburizing was 

indeed occurring and the alumina support and the alumina tube of the 
furnace have been clearly carburized, after every thermal debinding and 
sintering run, showing a typical graphitic color. The carbon on the 

alumina support and alumina tube of the furnace is an evidence that the 
atmosphere was rich in carbon during thermal debinding, and a higher 
gas flow should be helpful to decrease the atmosphere carbon content 

(GERMAN, 1990). Thus the carbon, which formed the carbide found in 
the XRD analysis, can be originated from the atmosphere that was rich 

in carbon after thermal debinding or, eventually, from residual carbon 
that is likely to happen for low heating rates and in cases where the 
binders are removed above 450 °C (GERMAN, 1990). 

Apart from the different compounds formed, no difference on the 
characteristic peaks of the nickel superalloy has been identified. The

different carbides, oxides and nitrides formed seem more to be sampling 

difference and might not have any relationship with the presence or not 
of alumina fibers during sintering. So far no literature was found 

reporting the influence of alumina in nickel superalloys on compound 
formation. 

 
Figure 116 – XRD analysis of sintered IN718 samples with and without 
Nextel™ fibers. Sintering atmosphere: forming gas 

The oxides, nitrides and carbides found in the IN718 samples 
explain the weight gain discussed previously that have disguised the 

mass loss during binder extraction. For this reason, the IN718 samples 
did not reach mass loss equivalent to 100% of binder removal, and 
values close to 60% have been measured. 

Another interesting aspect that might be related with the 
oxides/nitrides/carbides formation during sintering of the IN718 alloy is 

a shift of the FeNi peaks, as shown in Figure 117. The three 
characteristic peaks have all shifted to higher angles after sintering, 
probably due to distortions in the crystal lattices with the removal of 

certain amount of iron, chromium and niobium atoms from the alloy, 
which were previously in solid solution. The peaks shift should have 
been confirmed with the introduction of a small amount of silicon 

during the analysis, which would be used as a reference peak, however 
this procedure was unknown by the author by the time the samples were 
analyzed.

4.5.3.3. Porosimetry analysis 

The porosity of alumina and IN718 sintered tubes were analyzed 
by mercury porosimetry and the results are shown in Figure 118 and 
Figure 119. A considerable amount of mesoporosity has been detected, 

i.e. pores between 2 and 50 nm. But in both alumina and IN718 the 
biggest amount of porous was in the range of macroporosity, i.e. larger 
than 50 nm. 

A higher degree of porosity has been measured in the alumina 

tube, 40.57 %, with an average pore diameter of 0.62 ?m. For the IN718 
sintered tube a total porosity of 36.27 % was measured, with an average 

pore diameter of 1.98 ?m. The measured average pore diameter and 
level of porosity for both alumina and IN718 sintered tubes is adequate 

for some filtering applications, such as hot-gas filtration, for which a 

pore size ranging from 0.1 to 50 ?m and porosity about 40% are 
required (FERNANDO, et al., 2005). However, sintering should be 

improved to allow neck growth between particles and neck formation

5. CONCLUSIONS 

Regarding the preliminary tests: 

i. The production of disc-shaped samples via feedstock 
warm-pressing technique showed to be an easy, fast and 
versatile route for feedstocks development; 

ii. A binder system composed uniquely of LDPE showed to 
be inadequate for non-oxide powder processing, for 
which a reducing or inert atmosphere must be used 
during thermal debinding; 

iii. The use of a LDPE with higher MFI, i.e. higher 
viscosity, does not solve the problems of blisters 

formation, edge rounding and deformation, originated 
during thermal debinding in non-oxidizing atmospheres 
of warm-pressed samples with a binder system consisted 

of plain LDPE; 

Regarding feedstock development: 

iv. Deformation and edge rounding could be eliminated by 
increasing the solids content in the feedstocks; 

v. The viscosity model of Frankel and Acrivos showed to 
be the best model to describe the viscosity as a function 
of solids content for the alumina powder used in the 
present work; 

vi. The elimination of blisters could only be achieved by 
introducing at least 30 vol.% of PW in the binder system; 

vii. The introduction of fibers into the feedstock increased 
considerably the torque during mixing of IN718 
feedstock, but not for alumina feedstock. This difference 
might be related with powder composition, particle shape 

and particle size distribution; 
viii. Fiber breakage occurred during kneading and was 

evident on torque decrease of mixing curves. After 
extrusion, SEM images showed that fiber length has 
decreased from 30 mm to about 0.5 mm; 

ix. The fibers did not alter the debinding behavior of the 
warm-pressed samples; 



192 
 

Regarding powder thermoplastic extrusion: 

x. Higher extrusion pressures, which leads to higher 
feedstock compaction, are achieved with low cylinder 

temperature, low die temperature and high piston speed; 
xi. Cylinder temperature should be kept slightly above the 

backbone melting point. For the feedstock of the present 

work, the temperature of 120 °C is adequate. Above this 
temperature rough surface and banana shape defects 
happen, whereas below this temperature fish scale and 

stains appear in the extruded tube. 
xii. Die temperature should be kept below the backbone 

melting point, otherwise the extruded tubes show rough 
surface and banana shape. In the present work 78 °C has 
shown to be an adequate temperature; 

xiii. Extrusion speed should be kept as low as possible in 
order to avoid defects such as fish scale and banana 
shape. For the present work extrusion speeds equal or 

lower than 15.7 mm/min showed to be adequate, no 
matter the die geometry used; 

xiv. Piston speed should be controlled in order to guarantee 
the same extrusion speed for different die geometries; 

xv. Fiber alignment was successfully achieved with the use 
of powder thermoplastic extrusion for the production of 
short fibers reinforced composites; 

Regarding tubes debinding: 

xvi. Thermal debinding of tubes showed to be more critical 
than thermal debinding of warm-pressed discs, and tubes 
were more prone to undergo deformation; 

xvii. Deformation during thermal debinding could be 
diminished for IN718 tubes and completely avoided for 

alumina tubes with the use of a solvent debinding step, 
before thermal debinding; 

xviii. LDPE showed not to be the ideal binder for alumina and 
IN718 powders, since the onset of sintering temperature 
is considerably higher than the temperature of LDPE 
thermal removal (around 450 °C). 



193 

 

xix. Ethanol showed to be a good solvent for solvent 
debinding, being able to extract more than 90% of SA 
and PW from the compacts; 

Regarding tubes sintering and tubes characterization: 

xx. Sintering at 1300 °C for 60 min is enough for neck 
formation but not enough for neck growth of the used 

alumina and IN718 powders. Sintering temperature or 
time should be increased to develop mechanical strength 
of the tubes; 

xxi. XRD analysis of alumina tubes has shown that no 
unexpected phase or crystallinity change has occurred 

after sintering of alumina powder together with alumina 
fibers; 

xxii. XRD analysis of IN718 tubes has shown that the 
expected, but undesired, spinel phase was not formed on 
IN718 particles and alumina fiber interfaces. On the 
other hand, undesired carbides, nitrides and oxides have 

been formed, reducing the amount of this elements in the 
alloy and, consequently, causing a peak shift on the alloy 

XRD pattern. The formation of these compounds has 
showed that the thermal debinding and sintering 
conditions were not appropriate; 

xxiii. Porosimetry analysis have shown that, despite the 
sintering conditions, temperature and time were not 
adequate, the level of porosity and pore size distribution 

was adequate for some filtering applications, such as hot-
gas filtration. The increase in sintering level of would, 
however, decrease the porosity of the material, which 

could make the tubes inadequate for such applications. 

As a final conclusion it can be stated that the powder 

thermoplastic extrusion has proved to be a promising processing route to 
produce short fibers reinforced porous MMCs and CMCs.

SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK 

i. Study of mixing, extrusion and sintering behavior of 
different powders (e.g. nickel superalloy IN625) and 

other oxide fibers; 
ii. Investigation of the extrusion process with other binders 

systems, using for example polymers with higher 

viscosity, more adequate for the extrusion process; or 
polymers with higher evaporation/degradation 
temperature, allowing the onset of sintering to occur 

before the total removal of the backbone; 
iii. Extrusion of other profile geometries, e.g. rods and 

prisms; 
iv. Metrological analyses of the tubes after extrusion and 

after sintering; 

v. Study of the influence of sintering conditions and 
parameters on the microstructure evolution, especially 
regarding the neck growth and porosity; 

vi. Test of mechanical strength of sintered tubes and 
comparison between tubes with and without fibers, e.g. 

three point flexural strength; 
vii. Study the fatigue resistance of the porous tubes and the 

influence of the fibers on this property; 

viii. Investigation of filtration efficiency of the porous tubes; 
ix. Investigation of creep, wear and corrosion resistance of 

the porous tubes and study the influence of the fibers on 

these properties; 
x. Study other sintering techniques, such as hot isostatic 

pressing, which allows reach a full dense sintered 

compacts, for the use in other applications in which 
pores are undesirable.

ANEXO A – Resumo estendido em português 

Introdução e objetivos 

Materiais com poros interconectados são utilizados em diversas 

aplicações, em particular na filtragem. Exemplos de processos de 
filtragem são: purificação de água, filtração de óleo, filtração de 
aerossóis, filtração de gases quentes. 

Nestes processos, os materiais porosos devem apresentar as 
seguintes propriedades: 

i. Rede interconectada de poros; 
ii. Distribuição de tamanho de poros adequada; 

iii. Resistência mecânica; 
iv. Resistência térmica; 
v. Resistência a corrosão e a oxidação. 

Contudo, se por um lado estes materiais devem apresentar uma 

alta porosidade, por outro lado eles devem ter resistência mecânica 
suficiente para suportar os esforços impostos a estes componentes. 

A introdução de fibras curtas é uma maneira inteligente de 

aumentar a resistência mecânica destes componentes sem prejudicar a 
indispensável permeabilidade. 

O principal objetivo deste trabalho é a obtenção de compósitos 
tubulares porosos de matrizes metálica e cerâmica, reforçados por fibras 
curtas, através da extrusão termoplástica de pós. 

A extrusão termoplástica de pós é um processo capaz de produzir 
tubos de paredes finas, com alta razão de aspecto, isto é, tubos longos 
com diâmetro e espessura de parede muito inferiores ao comprimento. 

Além disso, a extrusão é um processo contínuo, com capacidade 
produtiva relativamente alta. No caso da extrusão termoplástica, uma 
das vantagens é a manutenção do tamanho de fibras, pois este processo 

impõe esforços cisalhantes muito inferiores se comparados com a 
extrusão convencional. Outra característica do processo em questão é o 

alinhamento das fibras na direção da extrusão. 
Além do objetivo principal, são também objetivos deste trabalho: 

i. Desenvolver um feedstock adequado aos processos de 
remoção de ligantes e extrusão; 



206 
 

ii. Investigar a influência das fibras durante os processos de 
mistura e remoção dos ligantes; 

iii. Investigar a influência dos parâmetros de extrusão, 
notadamente, temperatura do cilindro, temperatura da 
matriz de extrusão e velocidade do pistão; 

iv. Caracterizar os tubos sinterizados em termos de 
microestrutura, porosidade e fases cristalinas. 

Breve descrição experimental 

Para compor a matriz dos compósitos de matriz metálica foi 

escolhido pó de superliga de níquel IN718, com tamanho médio de 

partícula de 6,5 ?m em formato esférico. No caso dos compósitos de 

matriz cerâmica foi escolhido pó de ?-alumina, com tamanho médio de 

partícula de 2,5 ?m em formato poligonal. 
Como reforço foram selecionadas fibras comerciais de alumina 

Nextel™ 610, fornecidas pela 3M Company. As fibras foram fornecidas 

picadas no comprimento de 30 mm, com diâmetro entre 10 e 12 ?m. 
Como ligantes foram utilizados dois polietilenos de baixa 

densidade, um com índice de fluidez de 2,0 g/10min (LDPE02) e outro 
com índice de fluidez de 70,0 g/10min (LDPE70), parafina (PW) e ácido 
esteárico (SA). 

O desenvolvimento do feedstock foi dividido em duas etapas. 
A primeira consistiu em definir o teor de sólidos. Para isto foi 

utilizado somente polietileno (LDPE02 e LDPE70) e alumina, por ser o 

pó que rendia feedstocks de maior viscosidade. O teor de sólidos variou 
entre 54 e 62 % em volume. 

A segunda etapa consistiu em definir o teor de parafina no 
sistema ligante. Para isso foram utilizados como ligantes LDPE, PW e 
SA e, desta vez, feedstocks dos dois tipos de pós (alumina e IN718) 

foram produzidos. O teor de LDPE, bem como o de PW, variou entre 0 
e 95 % em volume. O teor de SA foi fixado em 5 % em volume. Nesta 
etapa foi utilizado o teor de sólidos definido na etapa anterior. 

O procedimento utilizado em ambas as etapas do 
desenvolvimento do feedstock consistiu em misturar os pós com os 
ligantes em um kneader (reômetro de torque) a 180 °C por 30 minutos e, 

em seguida a 152 °C por 40 minutos. Nesta etapa, o valor do torque 
necessário para a mistura foi importante na avaliação do teor de sólidos, 

bem como do teor de PW. Em seguida o feedstock produzido foi 
granulado em um reômetro capilar através de uma matriz de 1 mm de 



207 

 

diâmetro a 140 °C. Após isso, os grânulos foram prensados a morno (a 

temperaturas em torno da temperatura de fusão dos polietilenos) em 
forma de disco, através de uma prensa manual, sob força de 10 kN. A 

matriz utilizada apresentava 28 mm de diâmetro. A quantidade de 
grânulos prensada foi suficiente para produzir discos com espessura de 
0.8 mm. Os discos prensados foram então levados ao forno para a 

remoção dos ligantes, que se deu à 600 °C por 60 minutos, com uma 
taxa de aquecimento de 0,5 °C/min, em atmosferas redutora (no caso 
dos compósitos de matrizes metálica e cerâmica) e oxidante (somente no 

caso de compósitos de matriz cerâmica). Em seguida, os discos foram 
avaliados no tocante à de presença de bolhas e deformação, para 

definição do teor de sólidos e teor de parafina. 
Para a extrusão de tubos, as fibras de alumina foram incorporadas 

ao feedstock no teor de 30 % em volume. Tubos as seguintes geometrias 

foram extrudados: 

i. 10,0 mm de diâmetro e 1,0 mm de espessura; 
ii. 10,0 mm de diâmetro e 0.6 mm de espessura; 

iii. 4,5 mm de diâmetro e 1,0 mm de espessura. 

Os parâmetros de extrusão, isto é, temperatura do cilindro, 

temperatura da matriz de extrusão e velocidade do pistão, foram 
controlados a fim de se obter extrudados visualmente sem defeitos. 

Os ligantes foram removidos por meio de extração por solvente e 

extração térmica. A extração por solventes se deu a 60 °C em um banho 
de etanol 95 % durante 5 horas. A extração térmica se deu a 600 °C 
durante 60 minutos, com uma taxa de aquecimento de 0,5 °C/min, em 

atmosferas redutora e oxidante. 
Finalmente os tubos foram sinterizados a 1300 °C durante 60 

minutos, a uma taxa de aquecimento de 5,0 °C/min, também em 

atmosferas redutora e oxidante. 
Os tubos foram então caracterizados por microscopia eletrônica 

de varredura, difração de raio-X e porosimetria. 

Principais resultados 

Durante os testes preliminares os discos de alumina apresentaram 

defeitos após a extração do LDPE70, realizadas em atmosfera redutora. 
Os defeitos encontrados foram bolhas, arredondamentos das arestas e 
deformação. Nenhum defeito foi encontrado nos discos de alumina após 



208 
 

a remoção dos ligantes em atmosfera oxidante. No caso dos discos de 

IN718, os mesmos defeitos surgiram após a remoção dos ligantes em 
atmosfera redutora. Não foram realizados testes de extração em 

atmosfera oxidante para este pó, devido a potencial oxidação da matriz 
metálica. 

Não foram obtidos resultados melhores com LDPE02, e este 

polietileno não foi posteriormente utilizado, pois a viscosidade dos 
feedstocks com este ligante era muito elevada. 

Através da análise do torque durante a mistura dos feedstocks de 

alumina, com diferentes teores de sólidos, foi possível calcular o teor 
máximo de sólidos admissível para este sistema, no valor de 71,4 % em 

volume. Com base nos resultados de extração térmica dos mesmos 
feedstocks, o teor de sólidos ficou definido em 62 % em volume. 

Os valores de torque medidos durante esta etapa foram 

comparados a diversos modelos de viscosidade, sendo que o modelo de 
Frankel e Acrivos foi o que melhor descreveu o comportamento do 
feedstock em questão. 

A quantidade de bolhas nas amostras, após a extração dos 
ligantes, foi o parâmetro utilizado como critério para a definição do teor 

de parafina. Sendo assim o teor de parafina mínimo necessário para 
evitar a formação deste defeito foi de 30 % em volume. 

Por fim, o feedstock final para a extrusão foi definido, sendo 

constituído da seguinte forma: 

i. 62 % em volume de sólidos, dos quais: 
a. 70 % em volume composto de pós; 
b. 30 % em volume composto de fibras; 

ii. 38 % em volume de ligantes, dos quais: 
a. 5 % em volume de SA; 
b. 30 % em volume de PW; 
c. 65 % em volume de LDPE70. 

Durante a extrusão, a pressão interna do cilindro variou com a 
temperatura do cilindro seguindo a relação da equação de Arrhenius. 
Tubos extrudados com cilindro acima da temperatura de fusão do 

LDPE70 apresentaram empenamento e superfície rugosa. Os tubos 
extrudados abaixo da temperatura de fusão ficaram retos, contudo outros 
dois defeitos superficiais ficaram evidentes, como escama de peixe e 

manchamento. 



209 

 

A temperatura da matriz de extrusão foi controlada através do 

contato com fluido refrigerante. Os fluidos refrigerantes utilizados 
foram etanol e água. Os melhores resultados foram obtidos através do 

resfriamento da matriz com etanol e alguns tubos sem defeitos foram 
obtidos desta forma. 

Finalmente, o último parâmetro de extrusão controlado foi a 

velocidade do pistão. Foi observado que a velocidade do pistão não era 
o fator mais relevante, e sim, a velocidade de extrusão, à qual está 
diretamente relacionada a velocidade do pistão. Diversos testes foram 

feitos a diferentes velocidades e, finalmente, a velocidade de extrusão 
ótima foi definida como sendo 15,7 mm/min. 

Enfim os parâmetros de extrusão foram definidos da seguinte 
forma: 

i. Temperatura do cilindro: 120 °C; 
ii. Temperatura da matriz de extrusão: 120 °C na entrada e 

78 °C na saída; 
iii. Velocidade de extrusão: 15,7 mm/min. 

Sob as condições acima descritas, os tubos produzidos não 
apresentavam qualquer tipo de defeito visual. Diversos tubos com 

comprimento de aproximadamente 15 cm foram extrudados nas três 
diferentes geometrias. 

Em seguida, foi realizada a extração dos ligantes dos tubos. A 

tentativa inicial de remover os ligantes através de extração térmica foi 
ineficaz e os tubos colapsaram, perdendo, em alguns casos, totalmente a 
forma cilíndrica. Com base neste resultado decidiu-se por utilizar, 

previamente à extração térmica, a extração por solvente. 
A análise das amostras através de microscopia eletrônica, antes e 

depois da extração por solvente, mostrou que uma rede de poros surgiu 

nas amostras após a extração por solvente. A obtenção desta rede de 
poros tem por finalidade facilitar a permeação dos gases produzidos 

durante a posterior remoção térmica dos ligantes. 
Os resultados após a extração por solvente seguida por extração 

térmica foram satisfatórios e a maioria dos tubos não apresentou 

deformação. 
Finalmente, os tubos foram sinterizados a 1300 °C durante 60 

minutos. 

As imagens obtidas por microscopia eletrônica de varredura 
mostraram uma estrutura bastante porosa, na qual as partículas 



210 
 

praticamente não sinterizaram e o crescimento dos pescoços de 

sinterização não foi observado. 
A formação dos pescoços pode ser somente observada entre as 

partículas de IN718. As fibras, por sua vez, aparentemente não aderiram 
a nenhuma das partículas, tanto nos compósitos de matriz de IN718 
quanto nos de matriz de alumina. 

Os resultados de difração de raios-X mostraram que nenhuma 

fase diferente de ?-alumina formou-se nos compósitos de matriz 
cerâmica. Já nos compósitos de matriz metálica, picos de nitretos, 

carbonetos e óxidos foram identificados. Com base nestes resultados, 
pode-se dizer que a atmosfera redutora, rica em nitrogênio, interagiu 

com as amostras formando nitretos. O carbono, oriundo dos ligantes, 
que não foi totalmente extraído na forma de gases, também interagiu 
com as partículas metálicas, formando os carbonetos. A oxidação das 

amostras, por sua vez, mostrou que a vedação do forno não foi 
satisfatória, e uma quantidade significativa de oxigênio estava presente 
na atmosfera durante o tratamento térmico. 

Outro aspecto interessante observado na difratometria dos 
compósitos de matriz metálica foi o deslocamento dos picos 
característicos da liga de níquel. Este deslocamento se deve, 

provavelmente, a distorções na rede cristalina causada pelo 
empobrecimento da liga em relação aos elementos formadores de 

carbonetos, nitretos e óxidos. 
Finalmente, a análise porosimétrica das amostras mostrou que os 

tubos em matriz cerâmica apresentaram uma porosidade de 40,57 %, 

com um tamanho médio de poros de 0,62 ?m. Os tubos em matriz 
metálica apresentaram uma porosidade de 36,27, com um tamanho 

médio de poros de 1,98 ?m. A partir desses resultados pode-se dizer que 

os compósitos tubulares porosos de matriz metálica e cerâmica, 
reforçados por fibras curtas, obtidos através da extrusão termoplástica 
de pós, são adequados à aplicação de filtragem de gases quentes, a qual 

requer uma porosidade em torno de 40 %, com uma distribuição de 

tamanho de poros entre 0,1 e 50 ?m. 

Conclusões mais relevantes 

Em relação ao desenvolvimento dos feedstocks: 



211 

 

i. Deformação e arredondamento de arestas, após remoção 
dos ligantes dos discos prensados, puderam ser 
eliminados com o aumento do teor de sólidos; 

ii. A eliminação de bolhas pode ser alcançada somente com 
a introdução de, no mínimo, 30 % em volume de PW;  

iii. A quebra das fibras foi satisfatoriamente alcançada 
durante a preparação da mistura. 

Em relação à extrusão termoplástica de pós: 

iv. Altas pressões de extrusão, que trazem como 
consequência uma mais efetiva compactação do 
feedstock, são obtidas através de uma baixa temperatura 

do cilindro, baixa temperatura da matriz de extrusão e 
alta velocidade de extrusão; 

v. A temperatura do cilindro deve ser mantida ligeiramente 
acima da temperatura de fusão do backbone. Para o 
feedstock deste trabalho, 120 °C é uma temperatura 
adequada. Acima desta temperatura, superfície rugosa e 

empenamento dos tubos tornam-se evidentes, ao passo 
que, abaixo desta temperatura, escamas de peixes e 

manchas surgem na superfície dos tubos; 
vi. A temperatura da matriz de extrusão deve ser mantida 

abaixo da temperatura de fusão do backbone, caso 

contrário, surgem defeitos como empenamento e 
rugosidade na superfície dos tubos. Para o presente 
trabalho, 78 °C foi a temperatura adequada para a matriz 

de extrusão; 
vii. A velocidade de extrusão deve ser mantida a mais baixa 

possível, para evitar defeitos como escama de peixe e 

empenamento. Para o feedstock desenvolvido, a 
velocidade máxima que permitia a produção de 

extrudados livres de defeitos foi de 15,7 mm/min; 
viii. A extrusão termoplástica promoveu o alinhamento das 

fibras. 

Em relação à remoção de ligantes dos tubos: 



212 
 

ix. A deformação dos tubos foi evitada com a utilização de 
remoção de ligantes por solventes; 

x. Etanol é um bom solvente para extração de PW e SA; 

Em relação à sinterização e caracterização dos tubos sinterizados: 

xi. Sinterização a 1300 °C durante 60 minutos não é 
suficiente para promover o crescimento dos pescoços de 

sinterização entre as partículas e entre as fibras e 
partículas; 

xii. A análise difratométrica mostrou que nenhuma fase, 

além de ?-alumina, formou-se durante a sinterização dos 
compósitos de matriz cerâmica; 

xiii. Nitretos, carbonetos e óxidos foram encontrados nos 
compósitos de matriz metálica, indicando que a 
atmosfera utilizada não foi a mais adequada para a 

sinterização destes compósitos; 
xiv. Porosimetria mostrou que os tubos produzidos 

apresentam porosidade e distribuição de tamanho de 

poros adequada para a filtração de gases quentes. 

Finalmente, a extrusão termoplástica de pós provou ser um 
processo promissor para a obtenção de compósitos tubulares porosos em 

matriz cerâmica e metálica reforçados por fibras curtas.
