SUMMARY

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas and soil
management systems should be evaluated for their N2O mitigation potential.  This
research evaluated a long-term (22 years) experiment testing the effect of soil
management systems on N2O emissions in the postharvest period (autumn) from a
subtropical Rhodic Hapludox at the research center FUNDACEP, in Cruz Alta,
state of Rio Grande do Sul.  Three treatments were evaluated, one under
conventional tillage with soybean residues (CTsoybean) and two under no-tillage
with soybean (NTsoybean) and maize residues (NTmaize).  N2O emissions were
measured eight times within 24 days (May 2007) using closed static chambers.  Gas
flows were obtained based on the relations between gas concentrations in the
chamber at regular intervals (0, 15, 30, 45 min) analyzed by gas chromatography.
After soybean harvest, accumulated N2O emissions in the period were
approximately three times higher in the untilled soil (164 mg m-2 N) than under CT
(51 mg m-2 N), with a short-lived N2O peak of 670 mg m-2 h-1  N.  In contrast, soil N2O
emissions in NT were lower after maize than after soybean, with a N2O peak of
127 g m-2 h-1 N.  The multivariate analysis of N2O fluxes and soil variables, which
were determined simultaneously with air sampling, demonstrated that the main

RESUMO:      EMISSÃO DE ÓXIDO NITROSO DO SOLO NO PERIODO PÓS-
COLHEITA ALTERADA PELOS RESÍDUOS DAS CULTURAS DE
VERÃO E SEU MANEJO EM LATOSSOLO DO SUL DO BRASIL

O óxido nitroso (N2O) é o mais importante gás de efeito estufa excetuando o CO2, e os
sistemas de manejo devem ser avaliados quanto ao potencial de mitigação da emissão desse
gás.  O presente estudo foi realizado em experimento de longa duração (22 anos) e teve como
objetivo avaliar o efeito de sistemas de manejo nas emissões de N2O no período pós-colheita
(outono) em um Latossolo Vermelho distrófico típico situado na Fundação Centro de
Experimentação e Pesquisa Fecotrigo (FUNDACEP), Cruz Alta, RS.  Três sistemas de manejo
foram avaliados: um em preparo convencional com resíduos de soja (PCsoja) e dois outros em
plantio direto com resíduos de soja (PDsoja) e de milho (PDmilho).  As emissões de N2O foram
medidas em oito coletas de amostras de ar no período de 24 dias (maio de 2007), usando o
método da câmara estática.  Os fluxos foram obtidos pela relação entre as concentrações de
gases dentro da câmara em intervalos regulares (0, 15, 30 e 45 min), analisada por
cromatografia gasosa.  Sobre os resíduos de soja, as emissões de N2O no período avaliado
foram aproximadamente três vezes superiores no solo em PD (164 mg m-2 de N) do que em PC
(51 mg m-2 de N), atingindo pico máximo de curta duração de emissão de 670 mg m-2 h-1 de N.
Por outro lado, sobre os resíduos de milho, o solo em PD apresentou uma emissão inferior
(34 mg m-2 de N) do que após soja, atingindo valor máximo de 127 mg m-2 h-1 de N.  Variáveis
de solo foram avaliadas simultaneamente às coletas de gases, e a análise multivariada dos
resultados indicou que as principais variáveis controladoras da emissão de N2O foram a
atividade microbiana, a temperatura, a porosidade preenchida por água e o teor de NO3

- no
solo.  A inclusão do milho na rotação de culturas deve ser adotada em substituição à monocultura
de soja como estratégia de redução da emissão outonal de N2O em solos sob plantio direto do
Sul do Brasil.

INTRODUCTION

The atmospheric concentrations of the three main
greenhouse gases (GHGs) – carbon dioxide (CO2),
nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) – have
increased rapidly in the last few decades, which is a
phenomenon associated to anthropogenic activities
(Mosier et al., 1991; 1998).  Worldwide, it is estimated
that agriculture contributes with approximately 22 %
to the total CO2 emissions, 80 % to the total N2O and
55 % to the total CH4 emissions (IPCC, 2007).  On the
other hand, it is estimated that 75 % of CO2, 94 % of
N2O, and 91 % of the CH4 emissions in Brazil come
from agricultural activities (Embrapa, 2006).
Although emitted in smaller amounts, the global
warming potential of N2O is 296 times higher than of
CO2 (IPCC, 2007).  Thus, the marked contribution of
N2O emission by agriculture and the potential of this
gas to trap thermal infrared radiation justify the need

of characterization of the soil management practices
with a way to reduce soil N2O emission (Six et al., 2004).

Most N2O is produced by nitrification and
denitrification processes in the soil (Firestone &amp;amp;
Davidson, 1989).  Nitrification, which requires aerobic
conditions, depends on NH4+ supply and is mediated
by autotrophic bacteria, whereas denitrification is
performed by anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria, which
depend on the availability of labile organic C (Rice et
al., 1988) and NO3

-.  Their activity is intensified in
anaerobic environments or soil microsites with low
O2 availability (Moreira &amp;amp; Siqueira, 2006; Aita &amp;amp;
Giacomini, 2007).  In addition to these soil variables,
temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and pH
have also been identified as N2O-production-controlling
variables in agricultural soils, since they affect the
activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as well
(Maag &amp;amp; Vinther, 1996; Weitz et al., 2001; Dalal et
al., 2003).



POSTHARVEST NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM A SUBTROPICAL OXISOL AS INFLUENCED...         509

Among the agricultural practices, N fertilizers, soil
tillage, and legume grain crops have been cited
regarding their effect on soil N2O emissions.  The
inefficient use of N fertilizers and continuous legume
cropping are mainly responsible for stimulating soil
N2O emissions to the atmosphere since they increase
the soil mineral N content and influence the soil labile
C supply (Dalal et al., 2003; Gomes et al., 2009).  In
turn, soil tillage affects the majority of the N2O-
emission-controlling soil variables and higher
emissions of this GHG have usually been reported in
soils under NT than under CT (Rice &amp;amp; Smith, 1982;
Liu et al., 2007).  This finding has been attributed to
a lower O2 diffusion due to soil compaction (Vinten et
al., 2002; Baggs et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2006), mainly
in periods of frequent and intense rainfall (Jantalia et
al., 2006), and to a higher microbial biomass activity,
consuming O2 and forming anaerobic microsites
(Baggs et al., 2006).  However, most results regarding
N2O emission were obtained in temperate soils, and
limited information is available for tropical and
subtropical Oxisols, where favorable soil physical
properties of soil structure and aeration as well as
rapid water-infiltration may restrict N2O production
and emission by denitrification (Jantalia et al., 2006;
Metay et al., 2007; Jantalia et al., 2008).

The main objective of this study was to evaluate
the long-term effect of soil management systems on
N2O emissions from a Rhodic Hapludox in the
postharvest period of summer grain crops (soybean
and maize) under the subtropical climatic conditions
of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Experimental site characterization

The study was carried out in a 22-year experiment
conducted at the Fundação Centro de Experimentação
e Pesquisa Fecotrigo (FUNDACEP), Cruz Alta, state
of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil.  The research center
FUNDACEP (latitude 28 o 36 ’ S, longitude
53 o 40 ’ W, 409 m asl) lies in the center of the plateau
of the state (Rio Grande do Sul, 1994).  The soil is
classified as typic dystrophic Red Latosol by the
Brazilian Soil Taxonomy System (Embrapa, 2005),
and as Rhodic Hapludox by the USDA Soil Taxonomy
(USDA, 1999).  The regional climate is humid, type
Cfa 2a, according to Köppen’s classification (Moreno,
1961), with a mean annual rainfall of 1,755 mm (mean
from 1974 to 2006 – FUNDACEP weather station)
with an annual drainage volume of 513 mm and evenly
distributed rainfall during the year, slightly
concentrated in the spring (Maluf, 2000).  The annual
mean temperature is 18.7 °C (mean from 1998 to 2006
– FUNDACEP weather station), with a minimum
temperature of 8.6 °C in July and maximum of 30 °C
in January (Moreno, 1961).

The experiment tested two tillage systems (CT:
conventional tillage with plowing + disking operations
and NT: no-till with minimum soil disturbance) in
the main plots and three crop rotations in sub-plots
(13.3 x 30.0 m): CR-0 - wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/
soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.); CR-1 - wheat/soybean/
black oat (Avena strigosa Schreber)/soybean/black
oat+common vetch (Vicia sativa L.  Walp)/maize (Zea
mays L.)/radish oil (Raphanus sativus var.
oleiformis); CR-2 - black oat/soybean/wheat/soybean.
Crop rotation 1 was tripled and wheat, black oat and
black oat+common vetch were used as initial crops in
a way that both soybean and maize were planted in
the same summer of every year. At the beginning of
the experiment, the soil properties (0–0.20 m) were the
following: 570 g kg-1 clay, 120 g kg-1 silt, 310 g kg-1 sand,
32 g kg-1 organic matter, pH H2O = 4.5, P = 19 mg dm-3,
K = 0.21 cmolc dm-3, Al3+ = 0.12 cmolc dm-3, and
Ca2+ + Mg2+ = 0.42 cmolc dm-3.  The crops were
managed according to technical recommendations
regarding seeds, fertilization rates, sowing period, pest
and disease control, as specifically reported by Campos
(2006).

Treatments

Soil N2O emissions were evaluated in CR-1, in May
2007 in three plots in this crop rotation system.  Two
were assessed after soybean harvest, in succession to
black oat, under NT and CT, and the third after maize
harvest, in succession to black oat + common vetch,
under NT.  Maize was harvested on February 28,
2007, and radish oil was planted immediately after
the harvest, while soybean was harvested on April
18, 2007.  The cover crop used after soybean harvest
was black oat + common vetch, sown with a seed drill
SHM 1517.  Conventional tillage (CT) consisted of
plowing to a depth of 0.20 m, followed by harrow
disking to a depth of 0.15 m, within an interval of
two days between plowing and harrow disking.  In
the NT System, the winter cover crop was sown on
the maize and soybean residues and soil tilling was
restricted to the crop rows.  In each treatment, an
area of 2 x 2 m was delimited for soil N2O emission
and soil sampling.

Measurements of nitrous oxide emissions

Soil N2O emissions were evaluated eight times in
24 days with sampling intervals ranging from 1 to
5 days, immediately after soil tillage.  Air samples
for N2O analysis were taken using polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) static chambers (height 0.20 m, diameter
0.25 m).  Immediately before air sampling, the
atmosphere inside the chamber was homogenized with
an internal fan for 30 s and the internal temperature
monitored with a digital thermometer.  The chambers
were placed on an aluminum base which was inserted
0.05 m deep into the soil and maintained in the
experimental plot during the entire evaluation period.
During sampling, the internal chamber atmosphere

was isolated by filling water into a channel at the upper
part of the base upon which the PVC chamber was
supported. Three static chambers were used per treatment.

The air was sampled from 10 to 11 a.m., as
proposed by Jantalia et al. (2008), 0, 15, 30, and 45 min
after the closure of the chambers, using 20 mL
polypropylene syringes equipped with valves in the
top of the chambers.  Air samples were cool-stored
and taken to the Environmental Biogeochemical
Laboratory of the Federal University of Rio Grande
do Sul– Porto Alegre - RS, Brazil, where they were
analyzed by gas chromatography within less than 24
hours after sampling.  N2O was determined using a
gas chromatograph Shimadzu GC 2014 Greenhouse
model, equipped with an electron capture detector
(ECD), and a Porapack Q column at 70 °C, using N2
as the carrier gas at a flow of 26 mL min-1, injector
temperature of 250 °C and detector temperature of
325 °C.  N2O flows were calculated by the equation
F(N-N2O) = d[N2O]/dt x 28 x MW x P x V/ R x T,
where d[N2O]/dt is a change in the gas concentration
within the chamber in the time interval (L min-1);
MW is the molecular weight of the gas; V and T are
the volume (L) and the inner temperature (°K) of the
chamber; P is the pressure within the chamber,
assumed as 1 atm and R is the universal gas constant
(L atm K -1 mol -1).  The variation of the gas
concentration over time was obtained by the angular
coefficient of the adjusted linear regression.  The daily
mean N2O emission was calculated by the mean value
of the three chambers installed in each treatment and
the emission of the evaluation period was obtained by
the integration of the area below the curve, which
was established by the interpolation of the daily
emission values.

Soil analysis

Simultaneously to air sampling, the soil
temperature (0.10 m), gravimetric moisture, and the
NH4+ and the NO3

- contents (0–0.10 m) were
monitored.  The soil temperature was evaluated by
geothermometers and soil moisture calculated by
drying a sub-sample under forced air circulation at
105 ºC for 24 h.  The soil NH4+ and NO3

- were extracted
from the soil samples using 1.0 mol L-1 KCl solution,
determined by distillation in semi-micro Kjeldahl and
acid titration (Tedesco et al., 1995).  The microbial
biomass activity was assessed based on the
quantification of the soil CO2-C flux (Baggs et al.,
2003), determined by the concomitant CO2 and N2O
analysis of the same air samples.  In a GC 2014
chromatograph, CO2 was reduced to CH4 and
quantified by a flame ionization detector (FID) at
250 °C.  WFPS was calculated based on the values of
soil bulk density and gravimetric moisture.

Statistical analysis

The effect of the soil management systems on N2O
emissions was evaluated by descriptive data analysis

based on the mean standard deviation.  Soil N2O
emission, soil temperature, microbial biomass
activity, WFPS, and the NO3

- and NH4+ soil contents
were subjected to multivariate analysis based on
Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCA), using software
MULTIV (Pillar, 1997).  The data of each variable
were transformed by vectors (centering and
normalization) and the product moment was used as
similarity measure between the management systems
on the different evaluation dates.  Only coordinates
with eigenvalues &gt; 1 and explaining &gt; 30 % of
variability were considered.  Coefficients of correlation
&gt; 0.60 were included in the interpretation of the
principal coordinates.  The scatter diagram was
complemented with cluster analysis, which allowed
the verification of the similarity patterns among soil
management systems in each field evaluation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Meteorological conditions during the study
period

Mean daily air temperatures ranged from 4 to
18 °C during the study period, and rainfall from 0.1
to 69 mm (Figure 1).  On average, the weather
conditions were colder and wetter than in the normal
mean.  In May, the rainfall volume exceeded the
normal average of the period by 24 % (179 mm), while
the mean air temperature was 13 % (14 °C) lower than
the normal average in May.

Soil N2O emission

Soil N2O emissions were influenced by the tillage
systems and the soybean and maize post-harvest
residues (Figure 1).  From the soybean crop residues,
N2O emissions were higher in NT soil (164 mg m-2
N) than CT soil (51 mg m-2 N).  In the NT soil, the
N2O emissions peaked in the first two evaluations,
with a maximum of 670 mg N m-2 h-1 recorded
19 days after soybean harvest.  Afterwards, there was
an exponential decrease of N2O emission, although in
general slightly higher than the N2O emissions
recorded in the CT soil (Figure 1), with a N2O peak
(143 g m-2 h-1 N) on the 29th day after soybean harvest,
which was more than four times lower than the
respective value in NT soil (Figure 1).  In an Oxisol,
also in Rio Grande do Sul, Jantalia et al. (2008) found
fluxes in the range of 80 - 150 mg m-2 h-1 N for both
NT and CT in the first three weeks after sowing.  The
N2O emission ranges were therefore similar in the
cited and the present study, although Jantalia et al.
(2008) reported lower differences in soil N2O fluxes
between tillage systems and a lower N peak emission
compared to our results.  On the whole-year basis,
Jantalia et al. (2008) observed mean fluxes ranging
from 8.1 to 18.7 mg m-2 h-1 N.  In a three-year study,
Rochette et al. (2008) found that emissions from NT

plots in a poorly drained heavy clay soil were rarely
different (p &gt; 0.05) from those of moldboard plow plots
when fluxes were low, but were greater during almost
all episodes of high emissions, similarly to the trend
observed here.  In the study of Rochette et al. (2008),
a few peaks of N2O fluxes in NT plots reached
exceptionally high levels between 2.000 and
16.000 mg m-2 h-1 N.  The peaks of N2O fluxes from
temperate, poorly drained soil (Gleysoil) were much
higher than reported in our study with tropical, well-
drained soil (Oxisol).

Other studies, in agreement with the present
findings, also showed higher soil N2O emission from
NT than from CT soils (Rice &amp;amp; Smith, 1982; Smith et
al., 2001; Yamulki &amp;amp; Jarvis, 2002; Liu et al., 2006;
Liu et al., 2007; Rochette et al., 2008; Gomes et al.,
2009).  The main reasons, according to those authors,
is related to soil compaction and higher WFPS,
resulting from the higher soil moisture, and in some
cases, lower soil porosity in NT.  These variables are
inversely related to soil O2 diffusion, therefore favoring

N2O production by denitrifying bacteria activity.
Nevertheless, in the soil investigated, the small
difference in bulk density in the NT soil (1.23 Mg m-3
in the 0–0.10 m layer) in comparison to CT soil
(1.20 Mg m-3 at the same depth), and the considerable
similarity of the WFPS values (Figure 2) cannot
explain the 10 times higher N2O emissions from NT
than from CT soil in the first sampling (Figure 1).
This suggests the existence of other soil and crop
management factors controlling N2O emission in NT
soil, which will be approached by the multivariate
analysis.  At this same site, Chavez et al. (2009) and
Pes (2009) found that the seeding operation in NT
increased soil gas exchanges.  These authors suggest
that even the minimal soil disturbance by the driller
was enough to increase GHG emission.  In addition,
Varner et al. (2003) reported that mortality of fine
roots, due to their fast turnover, has the potential to
contribute significantly to N2O production and
fluxes.  Keller et al. (2005) found that soil compaction
also increased the N2O flux from a North Brazilian
Oxisol.

After maize harvest, the mean soil N2O emission
in NT soil was 34 mg m-2 N in the evaluation period,
with an N2O peak of 127 mg m-2 h-1  N (Figure 1),
which was approximately five times below the
maximum observed after soybean harvest.  The lowest
N2O soil emission in NT after maize harvest indicates,
mainly, the microbial biomass assimilation of mineral
N for high C:N maize residue decomposition, mainly
of NO3

- (Figure 2), decreasing the substrate to the
N2O production by denitrification and nitrification
processes in soil.

According to Aita &amp;amp; Giacomini (2007), the
decomposition of N-rich crop residues, eg., of soybean,
is less influenced by the lower soil-crop residue contact
in NT soils than by a high C:N ratio of the crop

residues.  This would explain the rapid increase in
the soil mineral N contents observed under NT after
soybean harvest (Figure 2).  Consequently, the input
of residues with a low C:N ratio represents a high
input of labile C, which stimulated microbial activity
and may have resulted in the considerable O2
consumption, creating anaerobic microsites in the soil
surface layer and favoring N2O production in the NT
soil (Smith et al., 2003).  On the other hand, in CT
soil this would have not occurred at the same intensity
since plowing and harrowing tillage harmonized the
crop residue distribution in the 0–0.20 m layer,
disfavoring the formation of such microsites.

The positive correlation between CO2 and N2O
fluxes (p &amp;lt;0.007, n = 8, r = 0.52) supports this
hypothesis, indicating that the highest soil N2O
emission occurred simultaneously with the peak of
soil microbial activity (Rice et al., 1988).  In studies
carried out in England and Germany, respectively,
Baggs et al. (2003) and Sehy et al. (2003) also verified
positive relations between the CO2 and N2O fluxes,
emphasizing that mulch on the NT soil surface
favored moisture conservation, besides gradually labile
C input, essential in the denitrification process.  The
relation between labile C and the denitrifying activity
in NT soil results in an increased N2O flux, as reported
previously by Rice et al. (1988) and Liu et al. (2007).

The N2O emission peaks observed in this study
were superior to those reported in earlier studies in a
South Brazilian Alfisol (Gomes et al., 2009) and Oxisol
(Jantalia et al., 2006; Metay et al., 2007; Jantalia et
al., 2008), in which soil N2O emission rates were
approximately five times lower than those found in
this study.  However, these studies were carried in
spring-summer, and the first with maize was grown
after common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), and the second
and fourth during soybean growth.  Therefore, in both
experiments the growing plants absorbed available
mineral soil NO3

- and because it uncorroborated to
N2O emission.  This study conducted after soybean
harvest possibly explains the higher soil N2O emission
rates, since in this period, emission peaks of up to
3,500 mg m-2 h-1 N have been verified elsewhere
(Yang &amp;amp; Cai, 2005; Ciampitti et al., 2005; 2008),
resulting from the large supply of labile organic C by
the crop residues and from the exudates and products
of nodule and root senescence, which are promptly
metabolized by soil microorganisms (Rochette et al.,
2004; Ciampitti et al., 2005; Yang &amp;amp; Cai, 2005).  In a
Canadian heavy clay soil, Rochette et al. (2004)
reported a short period of high emissions (up to
480 mg m-2 h-1 N) after soybean harvest, presumably
resulting from the high denitrification following the
input of available C and N substrates when the soil
water content was high.  In central Iowa (USA),
soybean fields exhibited N2O peak fluxes of 630 mg
m-2 h-1 N, after rainfall events (Parkin &amp;amp; Kaspar,
2006).  These results are similar to those found in our
study.

Multivariate analysis of the main variables
that control the soil N2O flux

The PCA analysis was used to identify the driving
variables of N2O emissions.  Through the ordination
analysis of the values of N2O emissions and the soil
variables, a scatter diagram was obtained for the three
treatments (Figure 3).  Axis 1 explained 36 % of the
data variability, and axis 2 explained 34 % (Table 1).
The variables with significant loading on axis 1 were
N2O emission, microbial activity (CO2-C), soil
temperature, and WFPS.  On axis 2, soil NO3- content
had positive loading and soil NH4+ content had a
significant negative loading (Table 1).

The soil N2O emission of the group III (1st, 2nd,
4th, and 5th samplings in NT soybean postharvest and
in the 4th in NT maize postharvest) were the highest
and were associated with soil temperature, microbial
biomass activity, WFPS, and soil NO3

- content
(Figure 3).  The relation of these variables with N2O
flux in this group indicated N2O production by
denitrification, which was favored by the high WFPS
values (Smith et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2007) and the
consumption of soil O2 due to the microbial activity
oxidizing labile organic C (Figure 2) in NT soil, and
consequent formation of anaerobic microsites.  These
results were similar to those reported by Khalil and
Baggs (2005), who claimed that the denitrification
process contributes considerably to agricultural soil

N2O emissions and that NO3
- availability is the major

driving variable regulating the magnitude of these
emissions.  On the other hand, in CT soil, the
occurrence of anaerobic microsites is not probable even
under soybean residues.  In the other samplings
(Groups I, II and IV), there was no prevailing control
factor in the N2O emission, which may explain the
lowest emission rates.  In a previous study carried
out in South Brazil, Jantalia et al. (2008) observed a
poor relationship between WFPS and N2O flux.  These
authors associate this result to frequently low WFPS,
of less than 40 %, despite heavy rain events (above
60 mm day) due to fast drainage into the Oxisol.

The findings of this study evidence the need of
enhanced crop rotations under NT after legume grain
crops, in particular soybean, to mitigate soil N2O
emissions.  For this purpose, the improvement of the
synchronism between N release by the legume crop
residues and the demand of the subsequent crop
(graminea or crucifera) with high N demand may be
a pormising strategy to reduce mineral N availability,
and consequently, reduce N2O emissions.  For the
evaluation of the effect of soil management on
reduction of soil N2O emissions in future research,
the whole crop rotation cycle should idealistically be
contemplated, taking the emission of the other GHGs
into account as well as soil C accumulation and the
CO2-C costs of crop production systems.

CONCLUSIONS

The N2O emission from soil after soybean harvest
is higher under no-tillage than under conventional
tillage. Results indicate that the denitrification process
is the major source of N2O in the wet and cool autumn
of Rio Grande do Sul, and that the main driving
variables of N2O emissions are microbial biomass
activity, soil temperature, water-filled pore space
(WFPS), and soil NO3

- content. The maximum soil
N2O emissions found in this study after soybean
harvest were higher than previously reported for
Brazilian Oxisols. Nitrous oxide emissions can be
reduced by the cultivation of maize in succession to
soybean, and by the sowing of high-N-demanding
winter cover crops immediately after soybean harvest.
