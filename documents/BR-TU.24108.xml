ABSTRACT

The Marajó Basin area presents geologic and geomorphologic features chiefly due to the Mesozoic extension

and post-Miocene neotectonics. The extension event with an Early and a Late Cretaceous phases originated

four sub-basins that constitutes the Marajó Basin, with a thick continental clastic sequence showing marine

influence. NW and NNW normal faults and NE and ENE strike-slip faults controlled the basin geometry. The

extension, related to the Equatorial Atlantic opening, propagated into the continent along crustal weakness

zones of the Precambrian Tumucumaque, Amapá and Araguaia orogenic belts. The neotectonic event is a

strike-slip regime which developed transtensional basins filled in by Upper Tertiary shallow marine (Pirabas

Formation) and transitional sequences (Barreiras Group), followed by Quaternary fluvial deposits and tran-

sitional sequences derived from the Amazon and Tocantins rivers and the Marajoara estuary. The current

landscape has a typical estuarine morphology. The coast morphology presents sea-cliffs on transitional Up-

per Tertiary sequences, while inwards dominate hills sustained by Mid-Pleistocene lateritic crust, with a flat

erosive surface at 70 m. In the eastern Marajó Island several generations of paleochannels associated with

fluvial-estuarine sequences are recognized, while a fluvial-marine plain is widespread on its western side.

Key words: Marajó Basin, structure, evolution, paleogeography, geomorphology.

INTRODUCTION

Beneath a thick Tertiary sequence in the Marajó Is-

land and adjacent areas there is a large extensional

Mesozoic rift system which consists of four major

sub-basins (Mexiana to the north, Limoeiro in the

center, and Cametá and Mocajuba in the south; Fig-

ure 1), evidenced from gravity and magnetic data

and detailed seismic interpretation (Rezende and

Geological and geophysical investigations car-

ried out by Petróleo do Brasil S.A. – PETROBRAS,

led to delineate the nature of the main structural fea-

tures of the basin, linked to the Gondwana break-

up and Equatorial Atlantic opening (Ludwig 1964,

Aguiar et al. 1966, Lana and Milani 1987). The tec-

tonic evolution is better understood if considering

important aspects of plate dynamics, basin geome-

try and rift kinematics to clarify the development of

the distinct structural compartments as well as their

heritage from Precambrian structures.

TECTONICS AND PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF THE MARAJÓ BASIN 521

The stratigraphic studies of the Marajó Basin

demonstrated that the oldest sedimentary sequence

is Paleozoic and is correlated with the Serra Grande

Group (Ipú, Tianguá and Jaicós formations) of the

Parnaíba Basin, and Trombetas Group (Autás-

Mirim, Pitinga and Manacapuru formations) of the

Amazonas Basin (Caputo 1984, Lima 1987, Carva-

jal et al. 1989) (Figure 2a).

The Marajó Basin filling is composed of a sed-

imentary pile from Early Cretaceous to the Oligo-

cene, which reaches a thickness of up to 11 km (Lima

1987). It is divided into the Rift and Post-Rift Se-

quences (Figure 2a).

The Rift Sequence is formed by two sedimen-

tary units (Miller and Avenius 1986, Carnes et al.

1989, Carvajal et al. 1989). The oldest rift unit

could be linked to the early rifting and is only rec-

ognized by seismic-stratigraphic studies; it appears

to be concordant to the upper one (Carvajal et al.

1989) and it may be Neocomian in age (Carnes et

al. 1989). The youngest unit is related to the widen-

ing of the basin, and was defined by seismic inter-

pretation and well data samples; it seems to be more

homogeneous and is characterized by discontinuous

seismic reflectors, and the borehole data indicate de-

position in continental to transitional environments,

mainly by fluvial and fluvial-deltaic systems (Breves

Formation, Itapecuru Formation in the southeastern

edge of the Cametá Sub-Basin).

The Rift column includes fanglomerates and

coarse sandstones of talus and alluvial fan deposits

(Jacarezinho Formation) deposited on the west side

of the Mexiana and Limoeiro sub-basins, and along

the Cametá Sub-Basin. Avenius (1988) mentions

the occurrence of mud-rich silt beds overlying the

Breves Formation, probably deposited in large shal-

low lakes or, alternatively, during a transgression

restricted to the Mexiana and Limoeiro sub-basins

(Anajás Formation).

The seismic signature of the Post - Rift

Sequence is characterized by continuous reflectors

formed by alternating layers of clay and silt, ev-

idenced by borehole data from the Mexiana and

Limoeiro sub-basins (Lima 1987). This sequence

includes two major units (Schaller et al. 1971):

the lower one (Limoeiro Formation), Paleocene, is

made up of sandstones and subordinate conglomer-

ates and clays; and the upper unit is formed by two

packages, deposited conformably over the Limoeiro

Formation and derived from deltaic and fluvial en-

vironments from Eocene-Pliocene (Marajó Forma-

tion) and Quaternary (Tucunaré Formation).

The upper part of the Marajó Formation is cor-

related to the Pirabas Formation, a shallow water

marine sequence, and Barreiras Group, a transitional

one, and have been interpreted as linked to the neo-

tectonics, as well as the Quaternary deposits (Tucu-

naré Formation; Costa et al. 1996).

Neotectonics comprises two sets of structural

and morphological features: (1) the Miocene-

Pliocene oldest set includes NW-trending transten-

sional basins, which resulted from displacement

along E-W and NE-SW dextral strike-slip faults; (2)

the Pleistocene-Holocene youngest set corresponds

also to transtensional structures. In the Miocene

the shallow sea (‘‘Pirabas sea’’) gradually expanded

on the continent and reached 150 km in the north-

eastern of the Pará State, followed by gradual con-

traction that allowed the development of the major

rivers. These rivers run chiefly parallel to the NE-

SW strike-slip faults that originated from the reacti-

vation of Mesozoic strike-slip faults throughout the

Quaternary.

This study, based on prospecting seismic data

and geological mapping, is meant to discuss rift ar-

chitecture, basement control on basin development

and landscape evolution related to the opening of the

Equatorial Atlantic.

STRUCTURE OF THE MARAJÓ BASIN

The disposition of Rift depocenters and depocen-

ter controlling faults suggest a half-graben struc-

tural/stratigraphic architecture of the Marajó Basin

with the sub-basins being separated and segmented

by ENE and NE-SW strike-slip faults (Carnes et al.

1989, Lara 1992, Villegas 1994).

The Limoeiro Sub-Basin is NW-trending in the

central portion of the Marajó Rift and its southern

TECTONICS AND PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF THE MARAJÓ BASIN 523

and northern boundaries, respectively with Mexiana

and Cametá sub-basins, are defined by the Arari and

Tocantins strike-slip fault zones (Figure 2b). At the

northern end of the Limoeiro Sub-Basin the major

normal faults curve northeastward to join the Arari

Zone. This sub-basin is divided by minor strike-

slip fault zones (Chaves, Anajás, Pará and Limoeiro

zones) into five distinct geometric extensional com-

partments, but their western margins are dominated

by large listric normal faults. Some listric main bor-

der faults have up to 6 km basement normal throw

(Miller and Avenius 1986, Villegas 1994).

The northwestern portion of the Limoeiro Sub-

Basin have major normal faults which curve north-

eastward to join the Arari Zone. This sub-basin is

formed on the west boundary by a series of linked

listric normal faults gently dipping to the south-

east and reaching a horizontal position at shallower

depths in the basement (Figure 3a). A roll-over is

well-developed in the hanging-wall of the detach-

ment fault, defined by rotated blocks of the base-

ment and lower Rift Sequence into the boundary.

This large anticline has been partly modified by pla-

nar and listric minor faults dipping towards the east.

The eastern flank is defined by planar and listric nor-

mal faults dipping about 60o to the west with a roll-

over on the flat-lying segment of the major fault, at

depth, which dies out gradually upwards on the steep

planar segment, where dominate an open syncline;

these features are associated with a large negative

flower structure which affects also the Tertiary pile

and is interpreted as the result of dextral strike-slip

displacement along the Arari Zone.

The central part of the Limoeiro Sub-Basin is

characterized on the west by an imbricated fan of

listric normal faults dipping to the east-northeast,

that probably become horizontal at a depth of about

15 km, where they should sole into the detachment

zone (Figure 3b). Eastwards, there is another listric

fan with a series of minor normal faults connect-

ing to the detachment at shallow depths in the base-

ment, which seems to control the development of

the youngest Rift Sequence (Figure 2a).This imply

that the Limoeiro Sub-Basin underwent high rate of

extensional collapse during later rifting, which ex-

plains also its greater width (Carnes et al. 1989). A

series of listric faults also define the east boundary

of this sub-basin, but there are normal faults cut-

ting the entire Rift pile suggesting several pulses of

faulting (Figure 3c). There are often high blocks

of the basement in the center separating the earlier

Rift depocentres near the sub-basin flanks (Figure

3d). This geometry can be followed southeastwards

until the Tocantins Zone.

A large isolated NNW-trending basement horst

block separates the Cametá from the Mocajuba Sub-

Basin (Figure 2b). The Cametá Sub-Basin displays

an asymmetric geometry formed by three smaller de-

pocenters bounded on the west flanks by planar and

listric normal faults dipping to the NNE. The roll-

over is followed on both the basement and filling,

but a synform dominates upwards on the steep seg-

ments of the major faults. The eastern margin of the

sub-basin is dominated by a broad flexural response

to the border fault system of the west since the base-

ment and lower Rift Sequence dip away from the

boundary (Figure 3e). The geometry throughout the

Mocajuba is similar to that of the Cametá Sub-Basin,

but it has been suggested that the basement horst

block may have been an effective barrier against

intrabasinal communication allowing a package of

sediments unique to the rest of the basin to be de-

posited (Carvajal et al. 1989).

The interpretation of potential field data

(Bouguer and magnetic maps) and seismic lines has

indicated the possible existence of strike-slip zones

bounding geometric distinct basin compartments.

Most of them display evidence of multi-tectonic

phases during the basin evolution, even during the

post-rift phase. They played an important role dur-

ing the normal fault propagation and, likely, con-

trolled the stratigraphy along the axis of the basin,

and can be interpreted as transfer faults since they

probably accommodated much extension parallel to

the extensional axis of the stress field. The usual

seismic signatures of these fault zones (Arari, Cha-

ves, Anajás, Pará, Limoeiro, Tocantins, Carapijó and

Santa Rosa; Figure 2b) are negative flower struc-

tures, which always cut the Cretaceous pile and can

be followed in the basement as steep, discrete zones.

The NE-SW Arari Zone is the most important

and extends from the Gurupá Arch towards the off-

shore. Seismic interpretations indicated that this

zone is defined by right-stepping en echélon pairs

of overlapping pull-apart sub-basins, of which the

Mexiana Sub-Basin is the best known feature, with

steep larger border faults on both the east and west

margins. The thick Tertiary and Quaternary sedi-

mentary piles deposited in the Mexiana Sub-Basin

implies that the Arari Zone remained active through-

out the Cenozoic. The available data suggest a multi-

phase tectonic evolution for the Mexiana Sub-Basin

which includes the following steps: (1) transtension

during the Cretaceous controlling the deposition of

a sedimentary sequence more than 5 km in thick; (2)

transpression probably in the Late Cretaceous induc-

ing chiefly folding; and (3) transtension throughout

the Cenozoic originating the Tertiary and Quater-

nary piles.

The neotectonic setting is defined by a series

of linked E-W and NE-SW dextral strike-slip faults

and NW-SE normal faults that are grouped into two

sets. The oldest set corresponds to NW-SE nor-

mal faults that controlled the deposition of the shal-

low water marine sequence (Pirabas Formation) and

transitional sequence (Barreiras Group) in the Up-

per Tertiary. The youngest set refers to a linked sys-

tem of strike-slip faults and normal faults forming

Pleistocene-Holocene pull-apart basins of variable.

Large slightly rotated blocks, which originated

by Upper Pleistocene NW-SE normal faults, domi-

nate in the current landscape of the Marajó Island.

The sea-cliffs and paleochannels widespread in the

eastern side of the island are closely related to the up-

lifted blocks, contrasting with large floodplain and

dense rectangular drainage pattern of the western

side which were developed on subsided blocks. The

Marajó Island formed due to the reactivation of the

Arari and Tocantins zones which, respectively, cap-

tured the lower courses of the Amazonas and To-

cantins rivers to the northeast throughout the Qua-

ternary.

GEOPHYSICAL SIGNATURE OF THE MARAJÓ BASIN
AND THE SURROUNDING BASEMENT

The old tectonic setting of the area around Marajó

Basin (Figure 1) is characterized by the Araguaia and

Tumucumaque orogenic or shear belts which have

been interpreted as the result of Precambrian conti-

nental collisions (Hasui et al. 1993, Costa and Hasui

1997). The continuity of the Araguaia and Tumu-

cumaque belts, respectively, to north-northwest and

southeast, coincides with the area where the Marajó

Basin was developed.

The Araguaia Belt trends N-S to NNW-SSE and

is composed of meta-sedimentary, mafic and ultra-

mafic rocks (Baixo Araguaia Super-Group), migma-

tized gneisses and granitoids (Colméia Complex),

and high-grade gneisses (Porto Nacional Complex)

in the southeastern margin (Hasui and Costa 1990,

Hasui et al. 1993). The Tumucumaque Belt, with a

NW-SE trend, is exposed from near Macapá to Para-

maribo (Suriname) and comprises various rock as-

semblages: granulitic rocks (mafic granulites, kin-

zigites, enderbitic and charnockitic gneisses) of the

Ananaí and Tartarugal Grande suites; medium-grade

tonalitic to trondhjemitic gneisses and granitoids of

the Guianense Complex; supracrustal rocks (meta-

volcanics, iron formations, quartzites, micaschists

and metagraywakes) of the Vila Nova Group (João

et al. 1979, Lima et al. 1974).

The structural framework of these belts consists

of imbricated ductile thrusts systems that are char-

acterized by a pervasive mylonitic foliation dipping

to the east and northeast. Along the Araguaia Belt

there are also NW to NNW-trending strike-slip shear

zones that have been interpreted as lateral ramps that

accommodated large amount of compression (Hasui

and Costa 1990).

Another belt (Amapá Belt), adjacent and paral-

lel to the Arari Zone, was suggested by potential field

data interpretation, but it has not been studied be-

cause it is completely covered by Tertiary and Qua-

ternary sedimentary deposits (Hasui et al. 1984).

The Bouguer map for the Marajó Basin and sur-

rounding areas is shown in Figure 4. NW-trending

positive and negative gravity anomalies are evident

526 JOÃO B. S. COSTA et al.

and they are not always coincident with the highs

and depocentres of the sub-basins. Several magnetic

anomalies also exist: the bipolar anomalies are not

related to magnetic geological bodies in the basin

filling as these are absent, and the linear anomalies

are only partly linked to the major fault zones.

As referred above, the Tumucumaque and Ara-

guaia belts are formed by large variety of litho-

stratigraphic units, which correspond to high and

low density/more and less magnetic rocks, besides

strike-slip ductile shear zones. This implies that

these rock assemblages should display positive and

negative gravity anomaly signatures, as well as bipo-

lar and linear magnetic anomalies. Therefore, the

geophysical patterns are thought to be mostly due

to the rock units and structures of the Precambrian

shear belts.

It has been also deduced that the distinct ge-

ometric compartments of the Mexiana, Limoeiro,

Cametá and Mocajuba sub-basins are closely related

to the complex patterns of the ductile thrust systems

and strike-slip shear zones of these belts. This is

supported by the detachment normal faults dipping

to the east and northeast and following the ductile

thrust systems, and by the NE-trending anomalies

along the Arari Zone coinciding with the strike-slip

faulting propagation during the Mesozoic, proba-

bly starting with reactivation of shear zones of the

Amapá Belt.

In summary, the Precambrian tectonic setting

suggests a strong control of the Araguaia and Tumu-

cumaque belts in the geometry of the major faults

of the Marajó Basin. However, if the Amapá Belt

is confirmed, this feature and the Araguaia Belt are

to be regarded as the pre-existing crustal weakness

zones for the Mesozoic extensional propagation into

the northern Brazil.

PALEOGEOGRAPHY

During the Paleozoic the Marajó region and sur-

rounding areas interconnected the Amazonas and

Parnaíba basins as demonstrated by the remnants

of Paleozoic sequences preserved in faulted blocks

on the shoulders of the Marajó Rift (Gurupá Arch;

Lima 1987). However, probably by the end of the

Paleozoic or Early Mesozoic, the Gurupá high had

developed into a well defined horst block with steep

normal faults delineating its flanks. The faults of

the east flank of the Gurupá Horst form the western

margin of the Marajó Rift.

The Marajó Rift may have begun forming in

the Early Mesozoic as a result of the separation of

the South American, North American and African

plates. The early phase of rifting is thought to be

of Late Triassic in age with the incipient rifting of

the North Atlantic propagated into the South Amer-

ican Plate. This is supported by the plate restoration

which shows that the Marajó region is on trend with

the early rifting stage of the North Atlantic (Miller

and Avenius 1986, Carvajal et al. 1989). A Late

Triassic-Early Jurassic age for the initial develop-

ment of the Marajó Rift coincides also with the mag-

matic event represented by dyke intrusions (Cassi-

poré Diabase, 250 to 180 Ma; Lima et al. 1974)

in Paleozoic sequences and Precambrian basement,

but the ages of the propagation of the earliest exten-

sional half-grabens are uncertain, mainly because

the early Rift Sequence has not yet been sampled.

Several major seismic packages have been

demonstrated throughout the basin. The early Rift

Sequence is restricted to the both flanks of the Li-

moeiro Sub-Basin and the west flanks of Mexiana

and Cametá sub-basins, and shows the tendency to

thicken into rift faults suggesting distribution in re-

sponse to active rifting (Carvajal et al. 1989). This

interval and the late Rift Sequence are believed to be

composed chiefly of fanglomerates derived from the

Gurupá Horst partly during the Albian as suggested

by continental clastic interval in the upper portion

(Figure 5a).

During the entire rift period a major fluvial sys-

tem probably flowed into Marajó from the west and

southeast (Bemerguy and Costa 1991). Some sed-

iments came into the Marajó region from eastern

and northern, but these areas are regarded as less

important sediment sources at least in the later rift

stage because part of the Pará-Maranhão Platform

was collapsing due to the spreading of the South At-

lantic rifting (Figure 5b). Additionally, it must be

considered the existence of the drainage divide be-

tween Marajó Rift and the young Atlantic Ocean,

which has worked as a natural barrier for the de-

velopment of a large drainage area in the north and

east of Marajó region. It must be conceded that the

Mexiana Sub-Basin is ideally situated to have re-

ceived a marine incursion during the latest rift time

since the Arari Zone would have been a shorter route

to the early North Atlantic and the Marajó region.

However, it is proposed here that much of the rift

fluvial clastics of the Mexiana Sub-Basin derived

from the broad surrounding platforms (Amapá and

Pará-Maranhão).

As Marajó Rift became more mature in the

Late Albian, the half-grabens have acquired a more

symmetric configuration followed by cessation of

faulting propagation and development of a major

unconformity that separates the Post-Rift Sequence

from the Rift Sequence. The Post-Rift Sequence de-

posited from Maastrichtian times to the Early

Oligocene, probably over an area of little physio-

graphic variation since it is characterized by a fairly

continuos package composed of fluvial and deltaic

clastics which thickens to the north, where a marine

influence is demonstrated by a brown shale inter-

val in the basal Post-Rift Sequence of the Limoeiro

and Mexiana sub-basins (Figure 5c). This inter-

val represents Late Paleocene-Early Maastrichtian

age marine sediments (Rezende and Ferradaes 1971,

Schaller et al. 1971), and thins westward due to the

sediment load of the Amazon River (Avenius 1988).

TECTONICS AND PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF THE MARAJÓ BASIN 529

The sediments supplied by the Tocantins River have

been covered the southern Limoeiro, Mocajuba and

Cametá sub-basins.

The Eocene marks another marine incursion

in the Marajó Basin that reaches the northwestern

Cametá Sub-Basin. In this sub-basin the transitional

environment is evidenced from flaser structures and

widespread bioturbed sediments, as well as black

shales with high organic content derived probably

from mangroves (Schaller et al. 1971). During the

Eocene-Oligocene the major hydrographic basins

of the Amazon region (Solimões, Madeira, Negro,

Amazonas etc.) has flowed eastward due to the An-

dean uplifting. This suggests that the sediment load-

ing of the Amazon drainage system has greatly af-

fected the northwestern portion of the Marajó Basin

since the Late Eocene.

In the Miocene-Pliocene much of the Marajó

region and surrounded areas subsided in response to

transtension linked to the dextral strike-slip regime

of the neotectonic scenario. This led to marine in-

cursion over large areas in the northern Brazil which

is demonstrated by shallow water marine sequence

(Pirabas Formation) followed by transitional se-

quence (Barreiras Group) exposed along the coast

and underlain the Pleistocene deposits up to 150 km

in the continent (Figure 5d).

The current landscape of the Marajó region and

surrounded areas is characterized by fluvial deposits

of the Amazon and Tocantins rivers greatly influ-

enced by marine incursions. This fluvial-stuarine

morphology is the result of the Tocantins River cap-

tured to the northeast and Marajó Island formation

in the Late Pleistocene (Bemerguy 1997; Figure 5e).

CONCLUSIONS

The overall arcuate shape of the Marajó Rift and

complex faulting geometry of the sub-basins are

believed to be controlled by the combined weak

zones of three distinct Precambrian orogenic belts.

General trends and fault patterns of the Mocajuba,

Cametá and Limoeiro sub-basins are strongly influ-

enced by ductile thrusts and strike-slip shear zones

within the Araguaia and Tumucumaque belts, while

the trend and fault systems of the Mexiana Sub-

Basin run parallel to the weakness zones of the Ama-

pá Belt.

Regional tectonic and stratigraphic evidence

suggests that the Marajó Rift has a half-graben ar-

chitecture that developed as a result of Mesozoic

extension and shearing. Several strike-slip faults

segmented the basin into geometric distinct exten-

sional compartments and controlled the stratigraphy

along its axis. Some faults are always characterized

by smaller pull-apart sub-basins along striking with

the Mexiana Sub-Basin being attributed to the en

echélon pattern within the Arari Zone. Therefore,

Mocajuba, Cametá and Limoeiro sub-basins are pri-

marily extensional while the Mexiana Sub-Basin is

greatly transtensional.

The Rift Sequence developed in response to

active rifting and was filled by continental clastic

sediments derived chiefly from the Gurupá Arch. In

contrast, the Post-Rift Sequence deposited during

a large quiescence period and received fluvial and

deltaic clastics with marine influence in the north-

western of the basin, throughout the Late Creta-

ceous-Early Oligocene.

Much of the current landscape is due to trans-

tension linked to strike-slip faults, which derived

chiefly from the Mesozoic strike-slip faults reacti-

vation since Miocene.

RESUMO

A área da Bacia do Marajó apresenta feições geológi-

cas e geomorfológicas devidas principamente à distensão

Mesozóica e à neotectônica pós-miocênica. O evento de

distensão, com fases do Cretáceo Inferior e Superior, ori-

ginou quatro sub-bacias que contituem a Bacia do Marajó,

com uma espessa seqüência clástica continental mos-

trando influência marinha. Falhas normais NW e NNW

e direcionais NE e ENE controlaram a geometria da ba-

cia. A distensão, relacionada com a abertura do Atlân-

tico Equatorial, propagou-se continente adentro ao longo

de zonas de fraqueza crustal dos cinturões orogênicos

pré-cambrianos Tumucumaque, Amapá e Araguaia. O

evento neotectônico é um regime transcorrente que de-

senvolveu bacias transtensivas preenchidas por sedimen-

tos marinhos rasos (Formação Pirabas) e seqüências tran-

sicionais (Grupo Barreiras) do Terciário Superior, segui-

dos por depósitos fluviais e seqüências transicionais do

Quaternário, derivadas dos rios Amazoans e Tocantins e

do estuário do Marajó. A paisagem atual tem morfologia

tipicamente estuarina. A morfologia costeira apresenta

escarpas em seqüências transicionais do Terciário Supe-

rior, enquanto no interior dominam elevações sustentadas

por crosta laterítica do Pleistoceno Médio, aparadas por

superfície erosiva a 70 m. No leste da Ilha do Marajó

são reconhecidas várias gerações de paleocanais com se-

qüências estuarinas associadas, enquanto no lado oeste

predomina uma planície flúvio-marinha.
