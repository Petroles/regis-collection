Resumo 
 

O estudo analisa a relação de energia e CO2, evidenciando o efeito de profundidade 

financeira para um painel de 13 países produtores de petróleo. As emissões de CO2 são 

examinadas, tanto como um motor de crescimento, como variável explicada. O estudo utiliza 

o modelo Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL), dados são anuais, cobrindo um período de 

1970 a 2012. Os resultados mostram que as emissões de CO2 causam crescimento económico 

no curto prazo, e as emissões são causadas pelo crescimento, tanto no curto como no longo 

prazo. Rácio entre produção de petróleo e consumo de energia primária contribui para a 

redução das emissões de CO2, no curto e longo prazo, e contribui para o aumento do 

crescimento económico. A profundidade financeira contribui para o aumento das emissões de 

CO2 no curto prazo, já no crescimento contribui para a sua diminuição no curto e longo 

prazo. Inflação contribui para a diminuição do crescimento no longo prazo. Os resultados são 

consistentes em relação ao CO2 como sendo um motor de crescimento económico e vice-

versa. Assim, os formuladores de políticas devem ter em conta que o crescimento económico 

pode levar a um aumento das emissões de CO2.

Abstract 
 

The relationship between energy and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and the financial depth 

was apprised within a panel of thirteen oil producing countries. The role of CO2 is analysed as 

economic growth driver and as explained variable. An Autoregressive Distributed Lag model 

with annual frequency data for the period from 1970 to 2012 was used. Our findings shown 

that CO2 promote economic growth in the short-run. The CO2 cause growth in long- and in 

short-run. The ratio between oil production and primary energy consumption impacts 

economic growth and the reduction of CO2 in long- and in short-run. The financial depth 

increases CO2 in short-run and depress economic growth both in long- and in short-run. The 

results for oil producing countries points to bidirectional causality between the CO2 and the 

economic growth. Therefore, policymakers of oil producing countries should be aware that 

economic growth may lead to an increase of CO2.

1. Introduction  

The paper studies the relationship between energy and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and 

highlights the financial depth effect on oil producing countries. The role of CO2 is analysed as 

economic growth driver and as explained variable. To scrutinize the nexus, a panel data entry with 

thirteen countries and a time period between 1970 and 2012 was used. The inclusion of inflation 

fulfil a gap on this nexus. Indeed, this indicator can be used as a proxy of economic instability for 

the oil producing countries. 

The oil production and consumption has an active role on the literature. In fact, more than 

understanding their impact on economic growth, we need to realize other effects in the energy–

growth nexus. This nexus raises concerns related with the environment, namely pollution and CO2. 

The relationship between CO2 and energy consumption is positive (Saidi and Hammami, 2015). In 

special, the role of financial development should be better comprehended to supplant the current 

lack of consensus (e.g. Goldsmith, 1969; Minier, 2009; Sadorsky, 2010; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; 

Deidda and Fattouh, 2002; Wachtel, 2003). This lack of consensus could be explained by the focus 

of research tends to be directed for the oil exporter countries (Fuinhas et al., 2015). 

The main objective of this paper is to understand the relationship between energy and CO2, 

highlighting the financial depth effect. To capture these effects, variables such as CO2, Gross 

Domestic Product, Oil Consumption, Exports, Oil Rents, Production, International Crude Oil Prices, 

Inflation, and Financial Depth were used. The fact of analysing a long- time period allows dynamic 

relationships between variables and therefore, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model 

comes out as the most suitable. An empirically supported multivariate panel was elaborated with 

the following specifications: (i) Group of oil producing countries with available data; (ii) A review of 

the ratio between oil production and primary energy consumption; and (iii) verify the impacts of the 

second oil shock. Following the procedure, the econometric techniques allows: (a) the evaluation of 

long- and short-run effects (b) to overpass the issue of the order of integration of variables. The 

used estimator allows to work with variables integrated I(0) and I(1); and (c) the usage of long- time 

span allow evaluate the co-integration or the long- memory (fractional co-integration) relationships 

among variables. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 review of the literature. Section 3 

describes data and methodology. Section 4 is centred on the results. In section 5, the results are 

discussed. Section 6 concludes.

2. Literature Review 

The analysis of the relationship between energy and CO2 highlighting the effect of the Financial 

Depth and Inflation is largely a new approach given that the topic is rarely addressed. By the 

reverse, growth-energy nexus is well known study area. A literature survey on energy-growth nexus 

can be seen in Omri (2014) and Menegaki (2013). 

The causal relationship between energy and growth suggests the incorporation of 

environmental issues and CO2. A literature survey on CO2-energy-growth nexus can be seen in Omri 

(2013). Furthermore, financial development associated with the growth-energy nexus is also 

featured at the literature. Financial depth can enhance economic growth and affect the demand for 

energy (Sadorsky, 2010). The empirical results reveal a positive and significant relationship between 

financial development and energy. This phenomenon occur when financial development is measured 

by the deposit money bank assets to GDP, financial system deposits to GDP, or liquid liabilities to 

GDP (Sadorsky, 2011). Following Karanfil (2009), Dan and Lijun (2009) examined the effect of 

financial development on primary energy use in Guangdong, China. They found unidirectional 

causality from energy use to financial development. The concern with the environment is reported 

in some studies, namely in the causality field. A literature survey on energy consumption, financial 

development, and economic growth and CO2 emission can be seen in Ziaei (2015). 

Due to the complex relationship of causalities and despite of the huge amount of studies in 

this area, the consensus among authors was far from reached. In an empirical overview, there are 

five possible occurrences: (1) Growth hypothesis – energy as a positive effect on growth; (2) Neutral 

hypothesis – absence of causality; (3) Conservation hypothesis – unidirectional causality from growth 

to energy; (4) Feedback hypothesis – bidirectional causality between growth and energy; (5) 

Resource curse hypothesis – “negative” energy produces growth. 

The resource curse hypothesis is suggested in the literature to analyse the causality 

relationships between energy and growth. This phenomenon may be described as an economic 

constraint to oil producer’s countries. Indeed, these countries expect to receive economic and 

social benefits from the wealth, generated by encouraging the local and national economy or 

indirectly by increasing tax revenues, as result of government involvement (Costa e Santos, 2013). 

In the analysis of CO2 embodying the nexus growth-energy and oil producing countries 

development, there are two decisions that must be done: (1) what is the most relevant energy 

variable to explain CO2?; and (2) with oil production, what is the most suitable ratio to explain the 

relationship between energy-growth-development and CO2? To answer to the first question, 

following seminal literature the oil consumption is the one that produce most appropriate results. 

Moreover, primary energy consumption and the decomposition of oil primary energy consumption in 

other power sources can also be used. Decomposing a variable allows a better comprehension of the 

main role of oil consumption in primary energy context (Fuinhas et al., 2015). The same authors 

highlight the importance of integrating oil consumption and productions variables as well as oil 

prices and international oil prices. It is expected that oil producer countries reveal some 



3 

 

idiosyncrasies, i.e. the existence of price volatility due to special circumstances, derived of the high 

correlation between fossil fuels and CO2. 

The nexus complexity may be harmed by the endogenous resources availability. That 

availability can be controlled through the computation. A literature gap can be verified with the 

lack of inflation on the group of financial variables. Furthermore, inflation may exert a positive or a 

negative impact on growth. The positive effect can occur due to the excess of demand and inciting 

a tireless rise of prices, and the negative effect stems of measuring economic instability, suggesting 

a possible economic volatility. With the oil producer countries, a negative coefficient is expected. 

In fact, the inflation and the relationship between energy and CO2 is not in focus at the literature 

and therefore there is a limited understanding of this variable.

3. Data and methodology  

For the analysis of the relationship between economic growth and CO2, was used a panel 

with annual frequency data from 1970 to 2012, for a group of oil producing countries, namely Saudi 

Arabia, Algeria, Australia, Denmark, Egypt, Ecuador, United States of America, India, Italy, 

Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago .These countries were chosen due to letting a 

continuous sample for the longest time span possible. The source of the raw annual data was the 

World Bank Data, for gross domestic product (GDP), exports of goods and services, oil rents, 

population, domestic credit provided by banking sector, domestic credit provided by private sector, 

and consumer price index; and the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, June 2014, for carbon 

dioxide emissions, oil consumption, oil production, primary energy consumption, and crude oil 

prices. The raw data variables used are: (i) GDP (constant local currency unit); (ii) exports of goods 

and services (% of GDP); (iii) oil rents (% of GDP); (iv) population (total of persons); (v) carbon 

dioxide emissions (million tonnes); (vi) oil consumption (million tonnes); (vii) oil production (million 

tonnes); (viii) primary energy consumption (million tonnes oil equivalent); (ix) crude oil prices (US 

dollars per barrel, 2013); (x) inflation (measured by first differences of logs of consumer price 

index); (xi) financial depth (% of GDP). The option of using a constant local currency unit allowed 

the influence of exchange rates to be circumvented. The econometric analysis was performed using 

Stata 13.1 and EViews 9 software. 

The raw variables were transformed in: (a) CO2 emissions per capita (CO2PC); (b) Gross 

Domestic Product per capita (YPC); (c) Exports of goods and services per capita (XPC); (d) Oil rents 

per capita (ORPC); (e) Oil consumption per capita (OCPC); (f) Ratio between oil production and 

energy consumption (SE) - this ratio is used to control the heterogeneity and the oil production 

(Fuinhas et al., 2015), and can measure the importance of oil production in terms of primary 

energy; (g) Ratio between oil production and consumption (SO) – this ratio registers the progress 

made during a time period of the relative weight of oil production to oil consumption, and is used to 

control the heterogeneity of oil producers; (h) Oil prices (P) – defined as the international oil price, 

this variable is equal to all countries. (i) Inflation (INFL) – computed as the first differences of the 

natural logarithms of the consumer price index; (j) Financial Depth (PF) – computed as the 

aggregation of the Domestic Credit Provided by Banking Sector (DCPS) and the Domestic Credit 

Provided by Private Sector divided by the GDP. 

The study follows two different approaches: (i) the first one evaluates the impact of CO2 as 

a source of economic growth with inflation as background; (ii) the second, using the same data, 

tries to capture the economic growth effect on CO2. Both approaches can be found at the 

literature. It is common to use Gross Domestic Product, measures of energy consumption, energy 

prices and traditional production factors. Occasionally, variables like exportations, CO2 per capita 

or urbanizations (e.g. Mohammadi and Parvaresh, 2014) or oil prices and production in scale 

(Fuinhas et al., 2015) or even financial development are used (Nili and Rastad, 2007). The inflation 

is rarely used in these approaches. This variable can have either coefficient signals, positive (as a 



5 

 

result of excess of demand causing a rise of production and prices) or negative (as a result of 

measuring economic instability). 

The dynamical effects are expected due to the long span of time. Different behaviours in 

the long- and short-run are also expected. The computation of the variables was made through the 

UECM from the ARDL, introduced by Pesaran and Shin (1999). The ARDL estimator possesses all the 

necessary properties to generate consistent and efficient parameters. Moreover, the estimator can 

deal with variables with integration order I(0) and I(1) and work as a support to the standard errors. 

The variables used are expressed in Logarithms (L) and first differences (D). The first coefficients 

match to the elasticities and the seconds to the semi-elasticities. 

The relationship between energy and CO2 will be tested with two different processes to 

capture the financial depth effect. First the growth model (YPC) evaluate the CO2 effect over the 

economic growth. Second, the CO2 model (CO2PC) assess the drivers of CO2. Severe attention must 

be paid to the individual coefficient interpretation. Indeed, with multivariate models all the 

independent variables are relevant and contribute to describe the dependent variable. The 

explanations provided should have in count the dynamical effects. 

The used countries share some common characteristics like oil production. Like that, Cross 

Section Dependence (CSD) is expected. This phenomenon implies interdependence between the 

crosses due to the common shocks (Eberhardt, 2011). If countries react in the same way to shocks 

the existence of correlations is verified. This fact suggests the existence of common non-observable 

events. Taking this in account, Table 1 with the descriptive statistics, coefficients of variation and 

individual CSD test is presented.

Through the Table 1 the highly dependence of the variables can be checked. With 

significance values of 1%, this shows that an introduced shock may affects in the same way all the 

countries. The CO2 was increased less than the economic growth. Moreover, CSD is not present in 

the variables LOCPC, SE and SO. This fact suggests that the countries react in different ways to the 

oil consumption and to de ratios oil production to oil consumption or primary energy consumption. 

The unit root tests of first and second generation were applied to verify the integration 

order of the variables, i.e. I(0) and I(1). The first generation tests used were Levin Lin e Chu (2002) 

(LLC), ADF-Fisher (Maddala e Wu, 1999), ADF-Choi (Choi, 2001), while the second generation test 

was CIPS (Pesaran, 2007). This test has the advantage of being robust for heterogeneity and relax 

the cross-sectional independence assumption. After computing the tests, it was confirmed that the 

variables are integrated I(0) and I(1). The absence of I(2) variables allows consistent estimations for 

the dynamical estimators. The results can be checked at Annex A. 

Another issue referred at the literature is the collinearity, i.e. the correlation between 

variables. Correlated variables mean that the independent variables explain in the same way the 

dependent variable. The correlation coefficients can be viewed at Table 2 and VIF statistics, to test 



7 

 

the multicollinearity, at Table 3. The VIF statistics were computed in level and first differences for 

both models, YPC and CO2PC.

Scrolling down from Table 2 to Table 3, some unwished coefficients can be observed. For 

the matrix table, a correlation coefficient that overpasses 0.8 reveals potential multicollinearity 

and may lead to some concerns. The energy variables (LEPC, LOCPC, and LOEPC) are strongly 

correlated with CO2 (LCO2PC) and exports of goods and services (LXPC) are strongly correlated with 

GDP (LYPC). To overcome this problem, the variables LEPC and LOEPC from the growth model and 

LXPC from the CO2 will be removed of estimations.

and µ6i +?6it corresponds for the error term. 

The following step was attesting the model specifications trough the Hausman test. This test 

faces fixed effects (FE) with (RE). According to the Hausman test, the null hypothesis represents RE 

model while the alternative hypothesis indicates FE model. The FE model reveals evidence of 

individual correlation between countries and removes all the invariant characteristics. The Hausman 

test selected the FE as the most suitable estimator. Indeed this result establish the necessity of 

computing another tests, namely to apprise the heterogeneity. For a dynamic approach, the 

heterogeneity may assume two shapes: (i) short- and long-run; and (ii) short-run. To deal with this, 

the estimators Mean Group (MG) and (PMG) could be applied. These estimators require a large 

number of observations (N) and time (T) (Blackburne III and Frank, 2007). The MG model is the most 

flexible, by enabling the heterogeneity of the coefficients between countries. This model is 

effective when long- and short-run estimations are made, but ineffective against homogeneity 

(Pesaran et al., 1999). This model needs a long span of time and a large number of countries, 20 to 

30 countries (Ciarlone, 2011). The PMG allows the existence of heterogeneity in the coefficients of 

short-run and homogeneity in the coefficients of long-run. If the presence of homogeneity in the 

coefficients of long-run is confirmed, the PMG model will be chosen as the most suitable.

4. Results 

The exhaustive control of the integration order of the variables is being conclusive as was 

shown at Annex A. As explained before, the econometric techniques must be suitable to deal with 

variables integrated as I(0) and I(1). To assess the presence of heterogeneity, the MG and PMG were 

carefully exanimated and tested against the dynamic FE estimator. 

The MG, PMG and FE model estimations as the results of the Hausman test are provided at 

Table 4. The variables without any significance were removed from the model. Moreover, trend and 

LORPC from the growth model, likewise the variables LOCPC, LORPC, LP and LINFL from CO2 model 

are not statistically significant.

The Hausman test of MG vs PMG for the growth model presents a negative coefficient. 

Indeed, the negative x2 from Hausman test although uncommon (see Dincecco, 2010) emphasizes 

the rejection of the first estimator (Hausman, 1984; Fuinhas et al., 2015). From Table 4 we can 

observe that the FE estimator is the most suitable, i.e. there is homogeneity for both models in the 

panel data entry. These results sustain that oil producing countries share same coefficients and can 

be treated in the same way. 

To reinforce the FE parameter significance, several tests were made to identify the 

existence of econometric violations, namely heteroskedasticity, correlations, autocorrelations and 

CSD. The Wald test was used to control the heteroskedasticity of the residuals. Next he Pesaran test 

analyses the presence of contemporaneous relationships between crosses. The null hypothesis 

specifies that the residuals are not correlated and follow a normal distribution. The Breusch-Pagan 

Lagrangian Multiplier was applied to test the cross sectional Independence and verify the 

correlation between errors. At last, the Wooldridge test assesses the presence of autocorrelation of 

first order. The results are revealed at Table 5.

The applied tests come out as appropriate and revealed the existence of heteroskedasticity, 

autocorrelation of first order and contemporaneous correlation. With these phenomena the 

elasticities and semi-elasticities, shocks and speed adjustments for both models are presented at 

the Table 6. The models were re-estimated and the significance of the variables was maintained. 

Furthermore, the elasticities of long-run have a different way of reading them. By the reverse, the 

short-run elasticities have a direct reading for having equal coefficients. To measure the long-run 

elasticities the ratio between the coefficient of each independent variable and the coefficient of 

the dependent variable (LYPC) for growth model and (LCO2PC) for CO2 model was made. Moreover, 

the variables had lag 1 and were multiplied by (-1). The results revealed Granger causal effects on 

both models (see Table 6).

5. Discussion 

The main objective of this study is highlighting the relationship between energy and CO2 

among with financial development for a group of oil producer countries. Furthermore, 2 different 

views can be found through CO2: (1) First as a growth engine; and (2) as a dependent variable 

explained by his own drivers.  

Preliminary tests revealed the presence of heteroskedasticity, CSD, residual correlation, 

first order autocorrelation and I(0) and I(1) of integration order. Moreover, the panel data entry 

used covers: (i) developed and developing countries; (ii) small and big oil producer countries; and 

(iii) to ensure a robust analysis, a large span of time was used. The dynamical panel data techniques 

are adequate to the study. Indeed, short- and long-run effects are detected, sustaining the former 

statement. The adjustment speeds are negative and statistically significant. The ECM term for the 

growth model is low (slightly over 8%, see table 8) while for the CO2 model is very low (under 3%). 

This fact suggests that a long span of time is needed when a shock is introduced. Likewise, the 

economic structure from the oil producer countries is weak and takes too much time to overpass 

possible shocks due to the lack of competitiveness. 

The growth model reveals a high number of positive coefficients in the short- and long-run. 

Undeniably, some variables only present a short-run effect on growth, namely CO2 (CO2PC), oil 

consumption (OCPC) and International oil prices (P). In the main terms, the variables that have a 

higher impact on growth are the goods and services exportations (EXPC) at long-run and oil 

consumption (OCPC) at short-run. Additionally, a negative coefficient is verified at the oil rents 

(ORPC) and financial depth (PF) both on short- and long-run. The inflation has a negative coefficient 

too but only at long-run. Forward, a more detailed discussion will be provided. 

At the CO2 model, variables like oil consumption (OCPC), oil rents (ORPC) and financial 

depth (PF) only enhances growth at the short-run. In this model, GDP (YPC) is the main propeller at 

short- and long-run. The relationship between oil production to consumption (SO) or primary energy 

consumption (SE) reveal explanation power at short- and long-run for both models. As result of this 

relationship, for growth have a positive impact while to CO2 as negative effect. This dissimilitude is 

expected. On the one hand, when oil production increases relatively to oil consumption this impacts 

positively on growth. On the other hand, the negative effect of the ratio of oil production to 

primary energy consumption indicates the phenomenon of concentration of wealth typical of 

economies that are resource abundant. Indeed, wealth concentration contributes to lower CO2 per 

capita due to the specialization effect (Fuinhas et al., 2015). 

Comparing both models expose interesting results. Indeed, oil prices (P) are highly 

significant at short- and long-run on both models. Furthermore, different signals are presented for 

the growth and CO2 models. A positive coefficient is revealed for the growth model and a negative 

one for the CO2 model. This phenomenon is consistent with the founded effect on oil rents (ORPC) 

and for financial depth (PF) with a negative effect on growth model and a positive effect on CO2 

model. Therefore, when the oil extraction costs decrease, the local economic will all suffer the 

effect. The financial depth coefficient presents a negative impact on growth model and positive

impact on CO2 model. In fact, this phenomenon may occur due to the recent financial crisis, a weak 

banking sector, and low level of finance trough the banking sector. In a different perspective, a 

positive impact could be in the agenda if the financial sector presents a low level of development, 

like the high growth rate of credit market in economies in development, originating a GDP increase. 

At last, inflation revealed a negative coefficient in the long-run at the growth model due to her 

functions, i.e. capture the economic instability. This result was expectant attending to the group of 

countries selected. Therefore, the instability effect dominates the excess of demand. Hence, this 

outcome suggests the presence of an indirect weak growth hypothesis of the oil-growth nexus. 

Indeed, the analyses of the two models detect causality running from CO2 to growth, and causality 

running from oil consumption to CO2, in the short-run. The obtained results should be considered by 

the policymakers in order to apply better energy policies.

6. Conclusion 

This paper analyses the relationship between energy and CO2, highlighting the role of 

financial depth and inflation. For this paper, annual frequency data from 1970 to 2012 for a group 

of thirteen oil producer countries was used. Additionally, CO2 are studied as a growth propellant 

and as explained variable. 

The results contribute to the literature by providing a detailed explanation to the growth-

CO2 nexus. Furthermore, the introduction of a new variable, namely inflation, revealed to be a 

good innovation. The financial institutions in oil producer countries are weak and financial sector is 

undeveloped. Other factor can be provided from the excess of financial system development. In the 

literature, excess of finance harms growth. 

The consistence of the results suggest that the resources curse phenomenon should not be 

neglected and deserve be considered in the literature. In fact, most of the studies only use rents 

from exploration of endogenous resources. The results are consistent as the CO2 are an important 

growth driver and vice-versa. Moreover, the emissions cause economic growth on the short-run. A 

bi-directional relationship between CO2 and growth was shown. The ratio between oil production 

and primary energy consumption reduce CO2 at short- and long-run. At the growth model this ratio 

is a driver to growth. The oil consumption contributes for both growth and short-run CO2. Similar 

results are obtained with financial depth and oil rents. The inflations imply a decrease on growth at 

long-run while oil prices reduces CO2 in the short-run and enhance growth at short-run to. Both 

exportations and ratio between oil production and consumption increase the growth rate at short- 

and long-run. This phenomenon emphasizes that an increase in exports and surpluses promotes 

economic growth. Oil rents decrease the growth rate at short- and long-run, i.e. the resources curse 

could be considered as a blessing to these countries.
