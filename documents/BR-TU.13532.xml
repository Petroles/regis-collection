ABSTRACT

An original and detailed study focusing the petrography of evaporites from the Late Aptian deposits exposed

in the eastern and southern São Luís-Grajaú Basin is presented herein, with the attempt of distinguishing

between primary and secondary evaporites, and reconstructing their post-depositional evolution. Seven

evaporites phases were recognized: 1. chevron gypsum; 2. nodular to lensoidal gypsum or anhydrite; 3.

fibrous to acicular gypsum; 4. mosaic gypsum; 5. brecciated gypsum or gypsarenite; 6. pseudo-nodular

anhydrite or gypsum; and 7. rosettes of gypsum. The three first phases of gypsum display petrographic

characteristics that conform to a primary nature. The fibrous to acicular and mosaic gypsum were formed

by replacement of primary gypsum, but their origin took place during the eodiagenesis, still under influence

of the depositional setting. These gypsum morphologies are closely related to the laminated evaporites,

serving to demonstrate that their formation was related to replacements that did not affect the primary

sedimentary structures. The pseudo-nodular anhydrite or gypsum seems to have originated by mobilization

of sulfate-rich fluids during burial, probably related to halokinesis. The rosettes of gypsum, which intercept

all the other gypsum varieties, represent the latest phase of evaporite formation in the study area, resulting

from either intrastratal waters or surface waters during weathering.

INTRODUCTION

Ancient evaporites are economically important as

sources for salts (e.g., halite and potash) and metals

(e.g., Cu, Zn, Au), and as indicators for structural

traps of oil and gas (Warren 1999). These deposits

are abundant in sedimentary basins located along

the Brazilian continental passive margin, being par-

ticularly developed in the Aptian-Albian transition

(Hashimoto et al. 1987, Uesugui 1987). The evap-

orites of the Codó Formation in the São Luís-Grajaú

Basin (Fig. 1) are the only ones available for sur-

face studies in the north equatorial Brazilian mar-

gin. Detailed facies analysis of fresh exposures in

several open quarries located in the southern and

eastern margins of this basin has provided elements

to support a depositional system represented by a la-

custrine or sabkha complex (Paz and Rossetti 2001,

Rossetti et al. 2004). In addition, the deposits ex-

posed in these localities constitute an excellent op-

portunity to better understand the post-depositional

processes that took place after primary evaporite for-

mation. Such approach concerning to the Aptian

evaporites from the north equatorial Brazilian mar-

gin has not been conducted yet.

A preliminary field investigation showed that

the evaporites from the Codó Formation include

several morphologies, suggesting they might not

be all primary in origin. Petrographic studies of

evaporites are useful to help deciphering their ori-

gin (e.g., Ogniben 1955, Kerr and Thompson 1963,

Holliday 1970, Arakel 1980, El-Tabakh et al. 1997,

Aref 1998), allowing to determine the succession

of events that took place following deposition (e.g.,

Arakel 1980, Morad et al. 2000, Pérez et al. 2002).

Thus, this type of study applied to the Codó Forma-

tion might contribute to better define and/or recon-

sider the proposed lacustrine/sabkha system. Deci-

phering the post-depositional history of these evap-

orites might help to decide on their potential for

strontium and sulfur isotopic studies aiming to test

the hypothesis of a possible marine influence during

sedimentation, as previously proposed elsewhere

(e.g., Rossetti et al. 2000).

GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The Gondwana split up took place through several

steps, culminating in the Aptian with the break up

of African and South American continents (Góes

and Rossetti 2001). This process led to final estab-

lishment of several rift basins along the equatorial

Brazilian margin, where the São Luís-Grajaú Basin

is one of the largest, occupying 150,000 km2. This

basin has been interpreted as a unique structural

feature formed by combination of pure shear stress

and strike - slip deformation (Góes and Rossetti

2001). The main rifting developed in the Albian,

when fault offsets reached up to 400 m (Figs. 2A,

B), but initial fault displacement gave rise to a shal-

low and widespread basin where the Codó Forma-

tion was deposited in the Late Aptian. This unit is

defined at the top by a regionally correlatable un-

conformity marked by an irregular, erosion surface

with associated paleosol (Paz and Rossetti 2001).

Exposures of the Codó Formation include shal-

lowing-upward deposits attributed to lacustrine or

saline pan-sabkha depositional environments (Paz

and Rossetti 2001, Rossetti et al. 2004; Fig. 3).

In the Codó area, where a lacustrine system domi-

nates, the shallowing upward cycles consist of bi-

tuminous black shales, evaporites and, subordina-

tely, calcimudstones attributed to central lake depo-

sitional environments. These deposits grade up-

ward into gray to green shales and limestones (i.e.,

calcimudstone, laminated to massive peloidal wa-

ckestone to grainstone, and sparstone), related to

intermediate lake environments. The top of the shal-

lowing-upward cycles comprises massive pelite,

shale, limestone (e.g., intraclastic grainstone, ostra-

codal wackestone to grainstone, ooidal to pisoidal

packstone, tufa) and rhythmite of limestone and

shale. These lithologies display a variety of sedi-

mentary features consistent with marginal lake de-

position, such as paleosol, karstic surface, fenestrae,

meteoric cement, vadose pisoid. In the Grajáu area,

a saline pan-sabkha depositional environment was

proposed (Rossetti et al. 2004), being represented

by evaporite and locally tufa, gray-green shale, and

calcimudstone.

The evaporite facies consists of laminated

gypsum (formed by alternating darker and lighter

couplets that are up to 15 cm thick), gypsarenite,

and massive-macronodular gypsum, which record

deposition in flat lying areas, intraformational re-

working of previously deposited evaporites, and

remobilization of salts during burial, respectively.

Laminated gypsum occurs in both of the study

areas, dominating in the Grajaú area, while gyp-

sarenite was observed only in the latter. Massive to

macronodular gypsum is widespread in the Codó

area, occurring mostly in the nucleus of evapor-

ite lenses that are up to 5 m thick, which enclose

chunks of black bituminous shales. In the Grajaú

area, these deposits form diapiric features that are

up to 6-8 m high at the outcrop scale. The contact

between the massive-macrogranular gypsum and

the laminated gypsum is gradational, except locally

where the diapirs are well defined by sharp bound-

aries.

PETROGRAPHY OF THE EVAPORITES

The evaporite facies from the Codó Formation

were characterized petrographically through the

analysis of 86 thin sections distributed along

four vertical sections (Fig. 4). Based on morphol-

ogy and crystal relationships, eight phases of eva-

porite formation were recognized, which include

(Fig. 5): 1. chevron gypsum; 2. nodular to lensoi-

dal gypsum or anhydrite; 3. acicular gypsum; 4.

mosaic gypsum; 5. brecciated gypsum or gypsare-

nite; 6. pseudo-nodular anhydrite or gypsum; and

7. rosettes of gypsum. In addition to these evapo-

rite phases, an episode of carbonate (calcite/dolo-

mite) cementation or replacement took place in

these deposits.

CHEVRON GYPSUM

This type of gypsum was recorded in both of the

study areas, being much more widespread in sec-

tions located in the Grajaú area. The chevron gyp-

sum, which represents the lighter component of

the laminated gypsum facies, was described in a

previous work, and it forms horizontal beds that

are up to 10 cm thick of vertically aligned crys-

tals. Under microscope, the chevron crystals form

twin planes and superimposed growth faces with

acute angles arranged as a zig-zag, perpendicularly

to the crystal long axis (Fig. 6A). The chevron crys-

tals usually grew up or are mantled by thin dis-

continuous layers of shales (mostly with smectites).

Some thicker layers of chevron gypsum might dis-

play packages of crystals that slumped down into

the muds, resulting in a series of segments with

superimposed lower concave up shapes.

NODULAR TO LENSOIDAL GYPSUM OR ANHYDRITE

This evaporite was recorded only in subsurface,

occurring in association with shales. It consists

of either nodules of gypsum or isolated lensoidal

gypsum crystals that are parallel to bedding planes

(Figs. 6B,C). The nodules are up to 5 mm long, and

internally composed by a dark mixture of anhydrite

and gypsum that form a massive cryptocrystalline

framework.

FIBROUS TO ACICULAR GYPSUM

This type of gypsum occurs invariably in asso-

ciation with chevron gypsum, likewise forming

vertically oriented crystals similar to needles (Fig.

6D). Although individual areas with dominance of

fibrous and acicular gypsum were observed, in gen-

eral these types of gypsum are intergraded, result-

ing in a closely interlaced framework. Noteworthy

is the frequent presence of relics and/or ghosts of

the chevron gypsum within the acicular crystals.

MOSAIC GYPSUM

This type of evaporite occurs particularly within

the dark bundles of the laminated gypsum. It con-

sists of crystals of gypsum averaging 300µm in

length that are arranged into a mosaic framework.

The contact between crystals is usually ragged and

sutured. The mosaic gypsum typically displays an

abundance of relics of floating anhydrite, forming

a poikilitic texture (Fig. 6E).

BRECCIATED GYPSUM TO GYPSARENITE

This type of evaporite occurs most frequently inter-

grading with the mosaic gypsum within the darker

bundles of the laminated gypsum facies. It con-

sists of gypsum that occur as clasts ranging from

µm to 1 cm in diameter (Figs. 7A, B). The clasts

might be either angular to subangular, when a fitted

texture is recognized, or rounded, forming locally

a texture that is similar to gypsarenite (Figs. 7C).

The clasts are surrounded by either a continuous or

discontinuous dark cutan formed by a mixture of

clay, organic matter and iron oxides. Under crossed

polars, several clasts might display optical continu-

ity, forming large crystals that can reach up to 3 mm

of diameter (Fig. 7D). These contain abundant relics

of anhydrite.

PSEUDO-NODULAR ANHYDRITE OR GYPSUM

At the outcrop scale, this consists of either slightly

elongated or spherical fragments up to 5 cm long

of evaporites displaying a fitted texture (Figs. 8A-

C). Petrographically, the clasts are composed of ala-

bastrine gypsum, fibrous gypsum, and anhydrite. In

general, alabastrine gypsum is the most widespread,

occurring as a mosaic of crystals less than 200µm

in diameter (Fig. 8D). The crystals are very limpid,

i.e., typically with no inclusions. The fibrous gyp-

sum occurs secondarily as a series of parallel co-

lumns that can reach up to 1 cm long, which grew

within the fractures that define the clasts, being per-

pendicular to fracture walls (Fig. 8A-C). Unlike to

the alabastrine, the fibrous gypsum might display

relics of anhydrite. In addition, ghosts of fibrous

crystals are locally present within the alabastrine

gypsum (Fig. 8D). In places, some elongated clasts

are composed by microcrystalline lath-like anhy-

drite (Fig. 8E). Where these clasts are in contact

with mosaics of large gypsum crystals similar to the

ones described above, the latter form concave em-

bayments toward the anhydrites, leaving behind a

“dust” of anhydrite relics (Fig. 8E). Inasmuch, both

the anhydrite clasts and the mosaic gypsum might

display etched margins as they grade into fibrous

and alabastrine gypsum. Electronic scanning micro-

scopic analysis of the anhydrite clasts reveals a mix-

ture of anhydrite and limpid gypsum crystals that are

similar to those observed in the nodular to lensoidal

gypsum or anhydrite (Fig. 9A, compare with figure

6C). Noteworthy is that the anhydrite clasts occur

as spots intergraded with alabastrine and fibrous

gypsum.

ROSETTES OF GYPSUM

Rosettes of amber-colored gypsum are disperse

within the evaporites of the Codó area, being re-

stricted to the massive to macronodular gypsum

(Fig. 8C). The rosettes reach up to 5 cm of diam-

eter, and consist of fibrous crystals arranged into a

radial pattern. The rosettes unconformably cut into

all the other gypsum described above.

Carbonates associated with gypsum or anhy-

drite consist of calcite cement that fill fractures in

the brecciated gypsum or gypsarenite (Fig. 9B),

even where this facies is obliterated by pseudo-

nodular anhydrite or gypsum. The calcite also oc-

curs as enlarged crystals that grew upon the gypsum

from both sides of the fractures (Fig. 9C), in which

case it forms caries in the mosaic gypsum. On the

other hand, the alabastrine gypsum enters into relics

of calcite, forming caries toward them (Fig. 9D).

Rhombs of calcite after dolomite is locally present

(Fig. 9E). Celestite might be also present in asso-

ciation with the carbonates, occurring as pyramidal

crystals with etched edges.

PARAGENESIS

Combination of facies and petrographic characte-

ristics revealed that the foregoing described eva-

porites show features supporting both primary and

secondary formations. In addition, the petrographic

study also showed that at least great part of the sec-

ondary gypsum might have been formed under in-

fluence of the depositional surface, thus reflecting

the original brine characteristics.

Evidence for primary evaporite precipitation

is particularly recorded in the laminated gypsum.

We interpret that the chevron gypsum is most likely

primary in origin because they make a pattern, con-

sisting of vertically-aligned upward growing twin

crystals that are similar, though in a much smaller

scale, to many primary gypsum described in the liter-

ature (e.g., Schreiber and Kinsman 1975, Ciarapica

et al. 1985, Hovorka 1987, Logan 1987, Handford

1991, Smoot and Lowenstein 1991, Warren 1999).

In addition, the chevron gypsum is confined to the

laminated gypsum, defining typical horizontal bed-

ding planes. Important to mention also is that this

gypsum forms pairs with the dark (nodular) gyp-

sum, occurring in a very regular way throughout

the sections, resulting in bundles that probably re-

flect seasonal brine fluctuations. Hence, the chevron

gypsum would have formed under subaqueous con-

ditions between the sediment surface and the brine

due to sulfate saturation (Fig. 10A). Such feature is

attributed to the progressive upward precipitation of

salts on the floor of shallow (usually less than 2 m

Handford 1991, Smoot and Lowenstein 1991, Hov-

orka 1987), as suggested in a previous work (i.e.,

Rossetti et al. 2004).

Part of the light beds of the laminated gypsum

is made of fibrous and acicular crystals. This gyp-

sum morphology is similar to satin spar gypsum

commonly recorded filling fractures in many pub-

lications (e.g., Richardson 1920, Shearman et al.

1972, Mossop and Shearman 1973, Stewart 1979,

Gustavson et al. 1994, El-Tabakh et al. 1998). In

this instance, however, the satin spar gypsum is not

related to fractures but it records replacement of

the chevron gypsum. This is indicated by grada-

tion between these morphologies, and by the fact

that the satin spar gypsum displays many relics and

ghost of chevron gypsum. As replacement took

place, the beds were slightly deformed, but still

kept the primary horizontal bedding. Although clear

evidence is lacking, the absence of other types of

secondary gypsum in the light gypsum beds sug-

gests that such replacement took place shortly after

deposition, thus still under a strong influence of the

primary brine. Therefore, despite their authigenic

nature, the satin spar gypsum is considered as a re-

flex of the primary evaporite bedding.

The satin spar morphology reflects crystal

growth from very pure, supersaturated fluids, which

favored extreme elongation parallel to the c-axis

(Magee 1991). The close association of the acic-

ular to fibrous gypsum with the chevron leads to

suggest that formation fluids were driven from re-

mobilization of sulfates from the chevron gypsum,

whose formation naturally required high brine sat-

uration. It is important to mention that neither of

these authigenic processes were enough to destroy

the primary lamination. This is taken as evidence

to suggest that the formation of mosaic and aci-

cular gypsum took place cyclically and close to

the depositional surface, just shortly after formation

of the individual bundles.

The darker laminated gypsum is attributed to

displacive growth of crystals beneath brines derived

from supersaturated pore fluids in the capillary and/

or upper phreatic zone (Fig. 10B). This implies

periods of descending ground waters and eventual

exposure (e.g., Kerr and Thompson 1963, South-

gate 1982, Warren 1999). Thus, the light and dark

gypsum are taken as products of high and low water

level, respectively, which, given the high frequency

and symmetrical distribution along the vertical sec-

tions, are most likely due to seasonal fluctuations

(Figs. 10C-E).

The cyclic alternation of fibrous gypsum with

dark gypsum containing nodular to lensoidal gyp-

sum or anhydrite is also a reflex of changes in the

depositional conditions. The formation of these

morphologies is consistent with deposition taking

place a few millimeter of the depositional surface

by displacive intrasediment growth of crystals be-

neath the brine from supersaturated pore fluids in

the capillary and/or upper phreatic zone (e.g., Kerr

and Thomson 1963, Warren 1999). As the brine

level decreased, nodular to lensoidal gypsum grew

displacively within the underlying sediments, here

represented by shales. This is the most common

habit of gypsum precipitated within the sediments,

either in mudflats or other environments subjected

to palustrine conditions (Magee 1991).

The presence of nodules composed by a dark

mixture of anhydrite and gypsum forming a mas-

sive cryptocrystalline framework is consistent with

this interpretation, being related to increased evap-

oration, probably due to climatic changes (Rossetti

et al. 2004). Similar masses of mixing gypsum

have been considered as the record of sulfate re-

placements during seasonal variations next to the

depositional surface (p.e., Arakel 1980, Mees 1998,

Mees and Stoops, 2003).

The mosaic gypsum was formed by replace-

ment of anhydrite, as indicated by the abundant re-

mains of this mineral within it. Mosaics of gyp-

sum crystals with sutured contacts have been in-

terpreted as a non-equilibrium texture of grain in-

terpenetration at low temperature (cf. Voll 1960),

probably reflecting formation under early diagene-

sis (e.g., Spencer and Lowenstein 1990). The occur-

rence of mosaic gypsum in association with the dark

bundles, alternated with chevron to acicular gypsum

within the laminated gypsum, might be taken as ev-

idence of replacement soon after deposition.

Extreme low brine level with subaerial expo-

sure resulted in gypsum fracturing due to desicca-

tion, a process that gave rise to in situ brecciated

568 JACKSON D.S. PAZ and DILCE F. ROSSETTI

gypsum and ultimately gypsarenite (Fig. 10E), the

latter recording local reworking at the surface as

recorded in other evaporite deposits (e.g., Sanz-

Rubio et al. 1999, Schreiber and El Tabakh 2000).

The frequent upward gradation from the brecciated

to the gypsarenite is consistent with this interpreta-

tion. The presence of mud cutans surrounding the

clasts is attributed either to mechanical infiltration

from downward flows or to the adhesion of residues

on clast surfaces during reworking.

Following brecciation, there was a phase of

widespread replacement, which gave rise to mo-

saics of large gypsum crystals affecting the dark

beds of the laminated gypsum facies. This sequence

of event is proposed based on the observation that

large gypsum crystals encompass several clasts,

attesting to pervasive cementation and/or replace-

ment. The presence of abundant relics of micro-

crystalline lath-like anhydrite within the mosaics

attests to their origin following a period of anhydrite

formation. Noteworthy is the fact that the mosaics

were developed only in the darker bundles of the

laminated gypsum, not affecting the lighter compo-

nents. Instead, the chevron gypsum was replaced,

as previously mentioned, by fibrous and acicular

gypsum.

Fracturing at the surface created porous, which

were cemented by calcite. Calcite also replaced

gypsum near the fracture sides. Under subaerial

conditions (i.e., vadose to freshwater phreatic), sul-

fate-undersaturated pore fluids dissolve gypsum

and/or anhydrite and release Ca2+ for precipitation
of calcite as the CO2?3 has more affinity with cal-
cium than with SO2?4 (cf. Back et al. 1983). Rare
dolomite rhombs might have been formed either

by replacement of calcite or simultaneous dolomite

precipitation. The dolomite was in turn replaced by

calcite. Dedolomitization is closely linked to karsti-

fication (Cañaveras et al. 1996). This process might

have contributed to release Sr2+, which combined
with SO2?4 , promoted precipitation of celestite (cf.
Olaussen 1981, Taberner et al. 2002). The celestite

formation, in turn, also releases Ca2+ that increases
the Ca/Mg ratio, and could have dissolved dolomite

bundles in the laminated gypsum facies, as well as brecciated

gypsum or gypsarenite. A) Brine concentration led to growth

of vertically-aligned chevron gypsum in the interface between

the sediment and the brine. B) During low water level, sulfate-

rich descending flows resulted in the origin of displacive gypsum,

forming nodular to lensoidal gypsum or anhydrite within the sed-

iment. C) Renewed phase of higher water level promoted mud

deposition. D) The increase in salt concentration due to evapora-

tion gave rise to a renewed phase of fibrous gypsum formation. E)

Extreme evaporation led to the eventual subaerial exposure of the

depositional surface, brecciation and reworking of previously de-

posited evaporites, with the consequent formation of brecciated

gypsum or gypsarenite facies.

1983, Kushnir 1985). The close association of cal-

cite, dolomite and celestite in the studied evaporites

of the Codó Formation suggests these processes as

the most likely.

The pseudonodular anhydrite or gypsum is in-

terpreted to represent a later phase of gypsum for-

mation. First, this is suggested by its occurrence

restricted to the massive to macronodular gypsum,

where primary sedimentary structures were almost

entirely lost. The presence of massive gypsum

grading into the laminated gypsum, and the diapiric

geometry enclosing chunks of black bituminous

shales is related to salt remobilization during halo-

kinesis. Second, the pseudonodular anhydrite or

gypsum contains limpid alabastrine and fibrous

crystals, not observed in association with the lami-

nated gypsum, which is consistent with the proposed

late formation. Fine crystalline gypsum have been

considered as secondary in origin (Holliday 1970),

forming in consequence of hydration, especially of

anhydrite, induced by diapirism or other mechanism

that allow percolation of water through evaporite

rocks (Holliday 1970, Warren 1999). Fracturing

seems to have been the cause of the pseudonodu-

lar aspect of this gypsum. Under stress, probably

related to salt remobilization, part of the gypsum

might have had a ruptile behavior, ultimately break-

ing apart to form individual fragments (e.g., Marco

et al. 2002). Saturated fluids percolating along the

secondary porosity created by this process would

have promoted precipitation of the fibrous gypsum.

In the following, there might have had the enlar-

gement of the fractures due to forcing caused by

crystal growth. While this process took place, most

of the primary sedimentary features, as well as the

previous phases of evaporites, became obliterated.

As the salt became mobile, there was a pervasive

development of alabastrine gypsum. The later na-

ture of this phase of gypsum is revealed by its limpid

aspect, free of anhydrite inclusions, and by the fact

that it contains ghosts of fibrous gypsum.

The spots with microcrystalline lath-like anhy-

drite that occur within the macronodular gypsum is

probably a relic of one of the earliest phase of evap-

orite precipitation in the study area. The paragen-

esis reconstituted with basis on petrographic rela-

tionships shows that these anhydrites form nodules

that were in part replaced by the mosaic gypsum,

as revealed by the fact that the later form concave

embayments that enter into the anhrydrite. The mar-

gins of this gypsum are, in turn, ragged due to re-

action with fibrous and alabastrine gypsum. These

relationships support that the anhydrite nodules

had an early development relative to all other gyp-

sum phases present in the pseudonodular gypsum.

If so, then it is possible that the anhydrite is tem-

porally related to the anhydrite formed in the dark

bundles of the laminated gypsum, which represents

one of the earliest evaporite phases developed in the

Codó Formation.

The final phase of evaporite formation is re-

corded by the rosettes of gypsum, as confirmed by

the fact that these truncate all the other evaporite

morphologies. Aggregates of large fibrous gypsum

crystals forming rosettes similar to the ones of the

study area have been attributed to the action of ei-

ther intrastratal waters during burial or surficial wa-

ters during weathering (e.g., Shearman 1966, Holl-

iday 1970, Warren 1999).

CONCLUSIONS

Despite the many varieties of evaporites recorded

in the Codó Formation exposed in the eastern and

southern margin of the Grajaú Basin, these deposits

display many petrographic and faciological attri-

butes that are consistent with an early formation, ei-

ther by primary precipitation or early replacements

when the sediments were still under influence of

the depositional surface. These types of evapor-

ites prevail particularly in the Grajaú area, where

laminated gypsum facies dominates. In both areas,

burial phases of gypsum seem to have developed

only where gypsum was remobilized during halo-

kinesis.

The lack of significant deep diagenetic modi-

fication of the Codó Formation is recorded also by

studies focusing the limestones and shales interbed-

ded with the evaporites. The limestones are domi-

nated by calcimudstones and peloidal wackestones

or packstones with only local evidences of cementa-

tion or replacement. These lithologies usually dis-

play primary features, as normal grading and hori-

zontal crenulated lamination. Inasmuch, the shales

associated with the evaporites consist almost en-

tirely of smectite, with only subordinate kaolinite

and illite. Among these clay minerals, smectite is

far the dominant one, being represented by detri-

tal flakes, while the kaolinite and illite are mostly

authigenic, being related to pedogenetic horizons

(D.G. de-Freitas, unpublished data). These data are

consistent with the proposition that burial did not

cause significant textural or mineralogical modifi-

cation of the Codó Formation.

The petrographic studies presented here

strongly motivate to undertake isotopic studies in

the evaporites of the Codó Formation. The analy-

sis should be carried out using samples from the

laminated facies only, which preserves evaporites

formed both primarily and shortly after deposition,

providing information on original brine characteris-

tics. On the other hand, the pseudo-nodular anhy-

drite or gypsum and the rosettes of gypsum should

not be considered for this type of studies, as they

represent later stages of gypsum formation due to

deeper salt remobilization. Inasmuch, the spots of

anhydrite within the pseudo-nodular anhydrite or

gypsum should be also discarded in these analy-

ses. Despite the interpretation that these evaporites

might have formed contemporaneously to the early-

formed nodular to lensoidal anhydrite, the micro-

scopic studies revealed they were strongly replaced

by limpid, alabastrine gypsum, being inappropriate

for isotopic analysis that can be used for paleoenvi-

ronmental purposes.

RESUMO

Neste trabalho, é apresentado um estudo original e deta-

lhado enfocando os aspectos petrográficos dos evaporitos

de depósitos aptianos superiores expostos no sul e leste

da Bacia de São Luís-Grajaú. O objetivo é o estabele-

cimento de critérios que permitam distinguir entre eva-

poritos primários e secundários, além da reconstrução de

sua evolução pós-deposicional. Sete fases de evaporitos

foram reconhecidas: 1. gipsita em chevron; 2. gipsita ou

anidrita nodular a lenticular; 3. gipsita fibrosa a acicular;

4. gipsita em mosaico; 5. gipsita brechada a gipsarenito;

6. anidrita ou gipsita pseudo-nodular; e 7. gipsita em

rosetas. As três primeiras fases apresentam característi-

cas petrográficas condizentes com origem primária. A

gipsita fibrosa a acicular e a gipsita em mosaico foram

formadas por substituições de gipsita primária, com ori-

gem provável nos estágios iniciais da diagenêse, portanto

ainda sob influência do ambiente deposicional. Estas

morfologias de gipsita estão relacionadas com a fácies

de evaporito laminado, tendo sido formadas por substi-

tuição, porém sem afetar a estruturação primária. A gip-

sita ou anidrita pseudo-nodular originou-se pela mobili-

zação de soluções sulfatadas durante ou após soterramen-

to, provavelmente associada à halocinese. A gipsita em

rosetas, que intercepta todas as outras variedades de gip-

sita, representa o ultimo estágio de formação de evaporitos

na área de estudo, tendo resultado de soluções intraes-

tratais ou de águas superficiais durante intemperismo.
