Herbivores in forest canopies and ecotones     .239

Abstract. The present article investigates the patterns of distribution of insect herbivores species in forest canopies dominated by
Byrsonima sericea and Mabea fistulifera, pioneer tree species, in disturbed and preserved ecotones and within-forest habitats of a
seasonal semideciduous tropical forest. The study was developed in the State Park of Rio Doce, South-Eastern Brazil. Both studied
species are frequent in the same type of low and open forests. Moreover, M. fistulifera occurs in the disturbed borders (successional
ecotones), while B. sericea in the ecotones with natural lakes, very common in this environment. We sampled insects living on 15
B. sericea and 23 M. fistulifera in the dry and wet seasons of 2001 and 2002.  A total of 670 insect individuals, distributed in 114
morphospecies were found on B. sericea (60 spp.) and M. fistulifera (66 spp.), but only 12 (10.5 %) co-occurred. Insect species
richness did not vary significantly between host species or habitats, but overall mean value was higher on B. sericea than M.
fistulifera. Species richness seems to increase with time, regardless of seasonality. Concerning insect species composition, M.
fistulifera and B. sericea had very distinct insect herbivore fauna, and B. sericea had distinct fauna between the lake ecotone and
inside the forest. In one hand, recent climatic shif ts may have caused severe ecological changes, which could have resulted in a
relatively poor insect herbivore community. In the other hand, long-term evolutionary exposition of those plant genera to herbivores
should have resulted in a greatly specialized insect herbivore community.

Key words: Insect herbivore, host plant specialization, habitat fidelity, species distribution in forest canopies.

Resumo: Espécies de insetos herbívoros associados a árvores pioneiras: contrastando habitats de dossel dentro de matas e em
ecotones. Este artigo investiga padrões da distribuição de espécies de insetos herbívoros em dosséis de florestas dominados por
Byrsonima sericea e Mabea fistulifera, espécies pioneiras, em habitats de ecotones perturbados e naturais, e em interior de mata, em
uma floresta tropical semidecidual estacional. O estudo foi desenvolvido no Parque Estadual do Rio Doce, sudeste do Brasil. Ambas
as espécies estudadas são freqüentes no mesmo tipo de habitat florestal. Além disso, M. fistulifera ocorre em bordas perturbadas
(ecotone successional), enquanto B. sericea ocorre em ecotones naturais com lagos, comuns na bacia do médio Rio Doce. Nós
amostramos os insetos de 15 indivíduos de B. sericea e 23 de M. fistulifera, nas estações secas e chuvosas de 2001 e de 2002. Um
total de 670 indivíduos de insetos, distribuídos em 114 morfoespécies foi encontrado em B. sericea (60 spp.) e M. fistulifera. (66 spp.),
mas somente 12 (10.5 %) ocorreram nas duas espécies. A riqueza de espécies de insetos não variou significativamente entre as
plantas hospedeiras ou os habitats, mas a média total foi mais elevada para B. sericea que para M. fistulifera. Independentemente de
sazonalidade, a riqueza de espécies parece aumentar com o tempo. Com relação à composição da espécies de insetos, a M. fistulifera
e B. sericea tiveram uma fauna muito distinta. Além do mais, B. sericea apresentou uma fauna distinta entre o ecotóne do lago e o
interior da mata. Por um lado, mudanças climáticas recentes causaram alterações ecológicas importantes que deve ter resultado em
uma comunidade relativamente pobre de insetos herbívoros. Por outro, a longa exposição evolutiva destes herbívoros aos gêneros de
planta estudados deva ter resultado em uma comunidade extremamente especializada.

are habitat components which may affect insect
species distribution. However, the difference between
habitat fidelity and host feeding specialization is poorly
understood. Recent articles have shown that tropical
canopies may hold a greater number of generalist
insect herbivores than ever expected (BASSET, 1992;
NOVOTNY et al., 2002).

The interaction between upper canopy and the
atmosphe re  is a very important aspect to be
considered while studying microclimate gradients
across foliage layers (BASSET et al., 2003). One
particularly approach to this subject could be the
canopy at real ecotones between forests and other
vegetation types. Mature forest borders adjacent to
artificial or natural herbaceous vegetation tend to be
covered with live foliage from the upper crowns
towards the branches closer to the ground. This
branch pattern tend to create a canopy-type of foliage
edge. Natural, as well as anthropical ecotones may
affect insect movement, population dynamics and
community structuring (CAMPOS et al. 2006a).

Research on this specific habitat-ecotone subject
is extremely rare (see FOGGO et al., 2001; RIBEIRO,
2003). We acknowledge only one study about the
insect herbivore species distribution in canopy of
gallery forests in natural ecotones with cerrado
vegetation, in the Brazilian savanna (RIBEIRO et al.,
1998), besides a companion work to the present
article, on ant assemblies (CAMPOS et al., 2006b). Most
forest edges, even natural ones, are dominated by
pioneer tree species. The size of these trees tends to
be low, creating a gradual decreasing in the canopy
height from inside forest towards the borders. Most
importantly, these species invest more in growth than
defence, and thus may cause increasing diversity of
herbivore species, and eventually define a distinct
specialist/generalist rates. (COLEY, 1983; COLEY et al.,
1985). Notwithstanding, forest ecotones are usually
dominated by fewer tree species. According to
current theory, trees with pioneer life history may
favour generalist insects, but high  abundance of a
few tree species can affect the insect species on the
opposite direction, favouring the population of
specialists. Another neglected aspect is whether
evolutionarily old plant communities would accumulate

INTRODUCTION

Tropical forest canopies were considered for a
while as one of the most important reservoir of species
diversity in the planet, especially of insect species (ERWIN,
1989, 1991; BASSET, 2001). Recent research has
pointed towards a more realistic contribution of
canopy habitats to insect diversity (BASSET et al., 2003).
Nevertheless, the canopy physical structure, eco-
physiology, biomass, and resources may affect a
reasonable amount of insect population distribution
(RIBEIRO &amp;amp; BASSET, 2007). Regardless the expansive
growth of quantitative research on tropical canopies,
each forest has its own natural history and evolution,
as well as ecological features which may shape
differently the relative importance of each forest
compartments. A few general patterns were already
explored, but further research on less studied forest
or tree life histories are urgently needed.

Amongst inse ct herbivore s, the  groups
Curculionidae ,  Le pidoptera, Chrysome lidae ,
Thysanoptera and Homoptera are the most speciose
in the various tropical rainforest canopies studies
(BASSET, 2001; NOVOTNY et al., 2003), which, in fact,
does not make them any different from any other plant
vegetation (RIBEIRO, 2003). In broad terms, Coleoptera
are the richest group in the canopy as in any other
vegetation type, but family frequencies and their relative
importance vary between continents and ecosystems
(BASSET, 1997; KITCHING et al., 1997; RIBEIRO, 2003).

Cano pies are  the  lo cation with hig he st
photosynthetic activity in a forest, and so are quite
suitable for insect population maintenance (NOVOTNY
et al., 2003).  The variation in young versus mature
leaves is influential for insect distribution (BASSET,
1991), as well as levels of leaf sclerophylly, which
seems to favour gall-forming species in the upper
canopy and free-feeding chewers in the understorey
(RI BEIR O &amp;amp; BA SSE T, 2007). In addition,  habitat
conditions ought to be also important (BERNAYS &amp;amp;
FUNK, 1999; RIBEIRO et al., 2005). For instance, nutrient
and chemical composition of foliage, free enemy
spaces (LAWTON &amp;amp; PRICE, 1979; LAWTON, 1986; BERNAYS
&amp;amp; MINKENBERG, 1997; RIBEIRO &amp;amp; BASSET, 2007) or tree
architectural traits (RIBA, 1998; RIBEIRO et al., 2003)

a greater rate of specialist herbivore species than a
more dynamic wet tropical forest (RIBEIRO, 2003;
RIBEIRO &amp;amp; BASSET, 2007).

Semideciduous tropical rainforests of South-
Eastern Brazil (in the  domain of the  Atlantic
Rainforest) survive in a highly fragmented landscape,
with nearly 95 % of its original area lost. Therefore,
remaining forest canopies are a mixed of persistent
and su cce ssional  tre e  speci e s. A spec ie s of
Euphorbiaceae, Mabea fistulifera Mart., dominates
many forest borders in this ecosystem, hereafter
called successional ecotones. This is also a species
frequent in natural low forests, normally related to
sandy and well drained soils.

Besides artificial border, some river basins and
drainages are complex and eventually rich in lakes and
other natural forest-water edges. One particularly well
studied system is the Mid-Doce River basin, Minas
Gerais State, which composes one of the largest lake
systems of South America. Hence, the natural ecotones
between the forest and lakes provide ideal comparative
borders to study effect of canopy dynamics near
transitional areas. In some lakes, the dominant tree
species is a Malphigiaceae species, Byrsonima sericea
DC., frequent in low forest with wet soils. This species
is also common in gallery forests of savanna vegetation.

This present article aims to compare the effects
of habitat structure (ecotone versus forest canopy)
on the inse ct he rbivore species richness and
abundance distribution between B. sericea and M.
f istulifera, in dif ferent seasons and years. The
following hypotheses and predictions are addressed:

1. There are differences in the insect herbivore
species richness and  abundance per tree crowns
compared between host species and habitats. It is
predicted that A) ecotone habitats will have less insect
species richness per crown than forest interior, due to
a simpler canopy structure, defined by a small number
of tree species. Conversely, if B) specialist insect species
prevail in this community, the number of insect species
between host species is not expected to change
significantly, although densities per crown may change
accordingly to population dynamics of dominant insects.

2. The re  are dif fe rence s in inse ct specie s
composition between host species, habitats, and along

time. It is expected a greater variation on insect species
composition along time in the ecotones compared to
interior forest, due to ecological unpredictability or
inconstancy in the former habitat. Moreover, specialist
species will predominate in the ecotones in response
to the great host plant abundance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study area
The study was developed within the State Park of

Rio Doce, in the middle basin of Doce river, South
Eastern Brazil (19o 48’ 18" – 19o 29’ 24" S; 42o 38’30"
– 42o 28’ 18" W (Fig. 1). This is the largest preserved
remain of rainforest in the State of Minas Gerais
(36.000 ha). This Park has an altitude of between
230m a 515m above sea level (SOCT, 1981), and is
under the influence of a mesothermic wet tropical
climate (ANTUNES, 1986) with clear wet (October –
March) and dry seasons (April – September) well
defined (GILHUIS, 1986). The Park is covered with a
very heterogeneous semidecidual seasonal rainforest
(LOPES, 1998; VELOSO et al., 1991).

Chosen sampling sites are the “Trilha do Gambá”
– TG – low forest (average 10 m tall trees) with a
mix of persistent and pioneer tree species, but well
preserved and well structure canopy (with both
studied species inside the forest); the “Orla da Lagoa
do Bispo D. Helvécio” - OLH – a sudden natural
ecotone betwee n low forest with he rbaceous
vegetation in the Dom Helvécio lake ashore, adjacent

to TG (dominated by B. sericea and without M.
fistulifera); the “Salão Dourado” – SD – successional
ecotone between secondary fire-disturbed forest and
an agro-ecosystem dominated by pastures in
floodable soil, in a separate area in the park
(dominated by M. fistulifera and without B. sericea).

Host plants
Studied plants are ecologically important, pioneer

species in the region. Byrsonima sericea (“murici”)
reaches 10 to 20m and is a heliophyla species,
capable to survive in mature forests in dense stands.
It has a large geographic distribution, occurring from
forests and gallery forests in the South-Eastern to
semi-arid white forest in North-Eastern Brazil
(LORENZI, 1992). In the study area, B. sericea is
commonly found in the lakes ashore (up to 5-8 m
tall trees) and in lowland grounds, near temporary
water creeks and channels (up to 20 m trees).

Mabea fistulifera is a semi-decidual early pioneer
species, heliophyla species, which can reach up to
20 m tall (LORENZI, 1992). It is found in open low
forest or in disturbed forests (10-20m tall) or in the
artificial ecotones between forests and pastures and
other cultivations (4-8m tall). It is a fast growing
species, with remarkable regenerative capability, and
very simple crown architecture. This species can
easily grow back a whole crown from a lateral
meristem (S.P. Ribeiro, pers. Comm.).

Insect Sampling Design
Insect herbivores were sampled on the crowns

of B. sericea and M. fistulifera, using a beating devise,
modified such as RIBEIRO et al. (2005). A random
branch (amongst those physically accessible in the
crown – see below) received 10 beats with a hard
stick above the collecting device. Insects collected
were pushed into a central orifice and kept in a plastic
bag attached to this orifice. After, they were identified
into family and sub-family level in the laboratory, and
then the most abundant and frequent morphospecies
were sent for identification by experts. In the present
paper, we focused on Coleoptera high taxonomic
resolution, and analysed feeding guilds in general,
based on morphospecies. To access the tree crowns

a 4 m tall ladder was used in the ecotone.  In the
forest, where the canopy was higher, single rope
clim bing te chnique s and safe  fr e e -clim bing
techniques were used to access tree crowns.

Beating samples were taken in the wet seasons
of 2001 and 2002 (February), and in the dry seasons
of 2001 and 2002 (September). However,  for
logistical problems, in the dry season of 2001 only
the ecotone trees were sampled, and thus this
sampling period was used only to investigate species
composition variation, and not for statistical
comparisons. The trees in the ecotones were
sampled in low and high branches to explore
stratification patterns (averaged for present analysis).

A total of 15 B. sericea in the ecotone and eight in
the forest were sampled in the whole project, and 23
M. fistulifera in the border and eight in the forest,
summing up 54 trees and 278 beating samples, as in
three sampling periods. The number of populations
studied and trees marked in each population scaled
up along the sampling periods. Ten trees of each
species in their respective ecotone habitats and six of
each within the forest are the initial numbers sampled
from the beginning of the project. Hence, this sub-set
of 32 trees was used to study patterns of species
richness and abundance in repeated measure ANOVA
models (see below). The whole beating sample was
used to study insect species composition, patterns of
species distributions and fauna similarity among the
populations and habitats, using multivariate analyses
(see below). The sample size difference between
ecotones and forest reflects the actual tree species
densities in these habitats.

Statistical analysis
The effect of habitat (ecotone vs. forest) and host

plant (B. sericea vs. M. fistulifera) on the insect
species distribution were tested across distinct
sampling period (wet season of 2001, wet and dry
season of 2002). This model was evaluated thought
a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), where
tree species and habitat were tested as fixed factors,
and sample periods were evaluated as multiple
dependent variables for the number of insect richness
or abundance - in different models – for the same

32 marked trees. MANOVA is adequate for analysing
time repeated data because it does not require the
dependent variables to be equally correlated as
repeated-measures. Such unstructured variance-
covariance matrix is then the  best choice  to
inve stigate  re spon se  of i nse ct r ichne ss  and
abundance variation to habitat and host plant, over
time of sampling, nevertheless also allowing the study
of seasonality effect (VON ENDE, 2001).

In parallel, ANOVA with repeated measures were
produced to test levels of significance related to
interactions betwe en host plant,  habitat, and
sampling period. Univariate repeated analysis
concomitantly with a MANOVA approach, were the
best choice in exploring more than two repeated
measures, as MANOVA looses power proportionally
to the number of dependent variable analysed (VON
ENDE, 2001). Hence, for these analyses 96 beating
samples were processed. To create a balanced design
which could allow the investigation of interaction
between host plant and habitats, the ecotone habitats
were joined together in comparison to the forest
habitat. ANOVA with Repeated Measures were
performed as far as the data matrix did not depart
significantly from sphericity, in which case an epsilon
adjustment was applied (VON ENDE, 2001), using
procedure in GLM Repeated Measures procedure
of SPSS 11.5 software. ANOVA models were used
with Sum of Squares Type III of this software, which
deals better with unbalanced replicates. It is important
to stress that comparison among mean number of
species and individuals per crown, and between
crowns and populations, are aimed in this analyses
(tested of hypothesis 1). Therefore, ecological
implications on the number of species and individuals
sustained on an individual crown, in a certain plant
community, are explored instead of estimations of
Gamma Diversity.

Discriminant analysis was used to investigate
insect species distribution between host species and
habitats. SPSS for windows 11.5 was used to perform
all parametric models cited above. Variation in species
composition among seasons and sampling periods
was described with a UPGMA cluster analysis,
developed with the Community Analysis Package 2.1

(Pisces Conservation ltd, 2002). For multivariate
analysis on insect community, a less balanced
sampling effort was used, in order to explore total
sampling size developed in this project. Hence, data
collected in the wet and dry seasons of 2001 and
2002, from 22 trees of B. sericea and 31 of M.
fistulifera, were analysed.

RESULTS

Species richness and abundance distribution
A total of 670 insects sorted in 114 herbivore

morphospecies was found on B. sericea (60 spp.)
and M. fistulifera (66 spp.) crowns, being that only
12 morphospecies (10.5 %) co-occurred in both
species. From a total of 31 insect herbivore families,
Curculionidae (24 spp.), Chrysomelidae (19 spp.),
Anob iidae  ( 2 spp.) ,  Cicad e llidad e  (5 sp p.),
Buprestidae (3 spp.) and Membracidae (2 spp.) were
the most abundant. Nevertheless, only few species
reached high  abundance numbers. Among the most
abundant Coleoptera genera (Fig. 2) we found
Mycrozurus sp (Curculionidae), one species of
Syphraea sp (Chrysomelidae), Parasypharea sp
(Chrysomelidae), Colaspis sp (Chrysomelidae), and
Tricorynus sp (Anobiidae). The greatest abundance
of Mycrozurus sp was found only on B. sericea
crowns, and mainly in the ecotone.

three sampling seasons for species richness and

abundance per crown, summed 264 insects of 74
morfoespécies. The analysis of mean species number
per tree sample showed a small number of herbivore
species in a sampled branch (overall mean varied
from 1.6 ± 0.14 in 2001-wet season to 2.0 ± 0.15 in
2001-dry season). Herbivore species richness did not
varied significantly between host species and habitats,
within any sampling period (MANOVA, Tab.1, Fig.
3). On the other hand, the average number of insect
species across sampling period, showed a higher
number of species on B. sericea than M. fistulifera
(2.05 ± 0.17 vs 1.56 ± 0.17, between-subjects effects,
repeated measures ANOVA, F

1,28 
= 4.05, P &amp;lt;0.05).

Moreover within-subjects linear contrasts (deviation
contrasts, generated by GLM in SPSS) showed a
trend towards species richness increasing with time,
regardless of seasonality (F

1,28
 = 4.46, P &amp;lt;0.045).

The insect abundance responded significantly to the
interaction term between host plant and habitat, but
only in the wet season of 2001 (Tab.2). This finding
was influenced by higher insect abundance (3.3 ± 0.45)
found in B. sericea in the forest (MANOVA, interaction
term, F

1,28 
= 5.9, P &amp;lt;0.02, Fig. 4). Regardless the lack of

a statistical significance for other seasons, values as high
as 4.2 (± 0.9) mean insect individuals was observed on
some B. sericea trees in the lake ashore, which was

mostly caused by a patchy distribution of the specialist
Mycrozurus sp. concentrated on few tree crowns, in
any dry or wet season.

insect herbivore species compositions. A noticeable
separation between the fauna on B. sericea and on
M. fistulifera was observed, but further separation
was found also within B. sericea located in different
habi tats. I n a Dis criminan t analy sis usi ng a
combination of plant species and habitats as
centroids, the Function 1 (Eigenvalue = 2.46)
explained 50.3% of data variation (?2

264
 = 338.6; P&amp;lt;

0.001, Tab.3). Although Function 2 (Eigenvalue =
1.82) did not distinguish significantly the centroids
(?2

174
 = 185.9; P &gt; 0.255), it explained 37.5% of data

variation (Tab.3). The inse ct herbivore  fauna
composition founded on B. sericea population in the
lake ecotone was distinct from any other host
population, and showed a strong positive correlation
with Function 1. The presence of high numbers of
Mycrozurus sp, Parasyphraea sp and Colaspis sp
def ined the main canonical coefficients behind
Function 1 (Tab.3, Fig. 5), besides Naupactus sp
(Curculionidae) and Chlamisus sp (Chrysomelidae),
which were also relatively more abundant and
frequent in the lake ecotone. Similarly, B. sericea
fauna in the forest was also positively correlated to

Function 1 as well as Function 2. As a consequence,
it was further separated from B. sericea trees in the
ecotone. However, it is worthwhile noticing that a
unique high frequency of Parasyphraea spp. was the
important pattern characterizing this host population.
Therefore, the habitats composed by B. sericea
crowns in the forest or in the ecotone supported
nearly the same herbivore species, although with
completely distinct species relative densities.

Mabea fistulifera insect fauna showed strong
negative correlation with Function 1 for both forest
and ecotone populations, but did not distinguish
amongst themselves. The clear separation of B.
sericea and M. fistulifera was due to the absence of
comm on spec ie s,  alo ng with  re mark able
particularities, such as the relatively high abundance
and frequency of one species of Syphraea sp and an
unidentified species of Cicadellidae, both exclusive
in the latter host species (Tab.3, Fig.5).

The present sampling design was not able to detect
any clear trend in species shifting along time or seasons,
for none of host tree species. In general, wet season
samples showed dissimilarity index lower than 20%
between hosts and habitats, while dry season samples
differ more than 35 % from the remaining samples,
except for ecotone population of M. fistulifera in 2001,
and within-forest population of B. sericea in 2002,
both very much similar to all wet season samples.

DISCUSSION

Other studies developed in this forest showed
similar results to ours, i.e., a remarkably small average
number of species and individuals per sample, clearly
lower than usually found in other tropical forest
canopy. NEVES (2006) and SOARES (2006) found in
an canopy sample of 73 tree species in the Rio Doce

Park equivalent figures to ours, as well as in a study
on an emergent tree species, the Anadenanthera
macrocarpa, authors also encountered few insect
species and individuals (CAMPO S et al., 2006b).
Therefore, any result obtained in this forest contrast
with other biomes sampled by the very same method
in the tropics (BASSET et al., 2001; ØDEGAARD, 2000).
SOARES (2006) has proposed that Rio Doce forest
may support a particularly insect species-poor
community due  to its e cological young age .
Geological studies suggest the whole region was
broadly covered by xeric ecosystems and more
opened vegetation no later than 4,000 years ago.

Nevertheless, the composition and relative
importance of insect herbivore families were very
much as found in most tropical ecosystems. The
dominant herbivorous families were Curculionidae,
Chrysomelidae and Anobiidae, independently of
habitat or host plant. For instance, BASSET et al.
(2001) found in Gabon (using beating and other
sampling me thods) that tre e  can opies we re
dominated by Chrysomelidae and Curculionidade.
Many other works in tropical canopies all over the
world (e.g. BASSET &amp;amp; SAMUELSON, 1996; HAMMOND et
al., 1996), with several sampling methods, agree that
Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae are the most
abundant and speciose families. RIBEIRO (2003)
emphasises that insect family relative densities and
diversity in tropical rainforest or savanna canopies
do not differ dramatically from those found in any
other environment. Such review suggests a strong
evolutionary and phylogenetic constraint behind
insect community composition, to which the present
data corroborate.

Species richness did not vary between host
species or habitats within each sampling period.
However, overall results suggest a greater mean
insect species number per crowns of B. sericea than
M. fistulifera. The same trend was not observed in
the cumulative number of herbivore species on each
host species, which were similar among the hosts.
In part, this pattern resulted from the low average
number of species per host tree individual.

The mean insect species numbers found on M.
fistulifera or B. sericea was greater than that found

Herbivores in forest canopies and ecotones     .247

on Brazilian cerrado tree species, which is an
expected result. The seasonal semidecidous forest
of Minas Gerais State has many common tree
species with the cerrado, and thus an entangled
ecologic and evolutionary history with that biome,
though poorly understood. Still, the higher humidity
or better soil conditions could result in a greater alpha
diversity of insect herbivores per tree individuals when
compared to cerrado host trees. A similar pattern
was found in comparing the total cumulative number
of insect herbivore species per tree, which varied
between 185 to 320 in tropical rainforest habitats
and 16 to 137 in cerrado tree species (Ribeiro 2003),
and 114 in the present study.

The number of insect herbivore species associated
to a host plant depends on its geographic distribution
and local  abundance (NEUVONEN &amp;amp; NIEMELÄ, 1981;
LAWTON, 1982; LEATHER, 1986; MARQUIS, 1991), as well
as chemical and nutritional leaf contents (CONNOR et
al., 1980; STRONG et al., 1984). Mabea fistulifera is a
latex species, which is a well known appetite inhibitor,
mainly for chewers (FARRELL et al., 1991). On the other
hand, Byrsonima is a cerrado genus, and when found
in the Atlantic rainforest domain, as in the present
study, the species occur in low canopy forests,
normally in sandy and less nutrient rich soils.
The re fore ,  Byrso nima spe cie s te nd to have
sclerophyllous leaves, which are clearly less palatable
to free-feeding herbivores (DINIZ &amp;amp; MORAIS, 1997).

Latex in M. fistulifera and sclerophylly in B. sericea
may prevent colonization and survivorship of
herbivores, particularly generalists. A noticeable
contrast with recent findings in insect herbivore
communities in tropical forest, is the fact that this
tree species are supporting an apparently specialist
herbivore guild. At least the dominant species found
on these plants are exclusive species, and typically
associated to the same plant species all year long,
over the last four years (S.P. Ribeiro, pers. comm.).
NOVOTNY et al. (2002) found more than 40 % of
generalist insect herbivore on many tree species in
Papua New Guinean tropical forest. We only had
10.5 % of insect species overlap, even though these
tree species were co-occurring in the same forest.
Mycrozurus sp. was clearly one of these specialist

and dominant species found only on B. sericea, being
a strong determinant of the canopy community
structure, namely in the lake ashore.

Each tree species crown traits may create distinct
microhabitat conditions that could influence insect
species fidelity, based on ecological aspects, such as
microclimatic constancy, predator and parasitoid free
spaces zones (BASSET, 1992; BARNAYS &amp;amp; MINKENBERG,
1997; RIBEIRO et al., 2005). On the contrary of B. sericea
fauna, that seems to be specialist but also partially
exclusive to one or another habitat (such as the
Mycrozurus sp.), the insect fauna found in M.
fistulifera follows the host species whatever habitat
occupied. In the present study a majority of the species
were found in this plant across the distance of 13 Km
between the studied populations. Therefore, habitat
differences between ecotones and within forest
canopies may result in the different insect herbivore
species composition found between B. sericea
populations, while M. fistulifera herbivore species
seems to have closer identity to that host tree species.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Our results corroborates other recent publications
on canopy habitats and herbivore species distribution
(RIBEIRO et al., 2005; RIBEIRO &amp;amp; BASSET, 2007), which
have challenged the classical concept of pioneer host
species been predominantly occupied by generalist
insect herbivores (COLEY et al., 1985).

The present work corroborates the perception that
surrounding habitats is an important aspect to be taken
in consideration in studies of insect-plant interaction.
In addition, our findings also reassure previous
conclusions as pointed by RIBEIRO (2003) and RIBEIRO
&amp;amp; BASSET (2007). Evolutionarily old plant community,
specially if adapted to extreme conditions, as those
found in xeric or sclerophyllous ecosystems of Brazil
(as antique as the Tertiary ages), may accumulate a
greater proportion of specialist insect species than
found in equatorial, nutrient rich wet forests.

As pointed by DRAKE (1990), historical information
may clarify patterns unlikely to be described by
contemporary ecological processes. Our work
suggest that recent climatic shifts may have resulted

in a relatively poor insect herbivore community,
although long-term evolutionary exposition of those
plant genera to herbivores should have resulted in a
greatly specialized insect herbivore community.
