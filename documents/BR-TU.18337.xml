Abstract  

The purpose of this project is to reduce bycatch by modifying a monofilament trammel net 

commonly used in small scale fisheries along the southern European and Mediterranean coasts. The 

standard trammel net consists of three layers of netting: a small mesh inner panel and two large mesh 

outer panels. The modified net has a single layer of netting 3 meshes high between the trammel net and 

the footrope termed “greca”, also known as a selvedge net. The main goal was to provide enough 

evidence of benefits that the modification poses, such as reduction in environmental deterioration, 

decrease in bycatch removal, and preventing a fisheries collapse, to local fishermen to convince them 

switch to the “greca” net. Fishing was conducted  off  the coast  of  Algarve  with  the  boat  departing 

from Quarteria from October 2016 to February 2017 with a total of 20 trips.  Each fish and invertebrate 

was identified and measured, and recorded in which net type it was caught after a 24 hour soak time 

period. The time that it took to remove bycatch species was later analyzed using videos recorded 

onboard using GoPros and net damage assessment was conducted after the sampling period. Analysis 

using PRIMER and PERMANOVA  showed that the factors depth and target catch affected commercial 

catch among the net types. This was also true for the combined catch data. Bycatch was also affected by 

the factor seasonality, however the separation between the two seasons was moderately distinct. When 

observing commercial catch, the greca net caught 53.9% of that of the standard trammel net regarding 

abundance and 64.3% of that of the standard trammel net in biomass. The economic value of the greca 

net catches was 61.8% of that of the standard net. The most significant decrease in commercial catch was 

seen among the sole species (or demersal commercial catch). Regarding discards, the greca trammel net 

caught 45.3% of that in the standard trammel net in commercial discards abundance and 57.7% of that in 

the standard net in bycatch abundance. The greca trammel net commercial discard biomass was 31.8% of 

that of the standard trammel net and 80.4% of the standard net bycatch biomass. For the three main 

bycatch species greca net catches for Longfin gurnards (Chelidonichthys obscurus)  were 37.8% of those 

of the standard net caught, 128.4% of the standard net for Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias) and 

66.9% of those of the standard net for the Greater weever (Trachinus draco). The time it took to remove 

an individual from the net was timed and the six most abundant bycatch species’ exhibited the 

importance of reducing bycatch. Some species will eventually take away many hours over the course of 

a year that could be spent on removing commercial catch or reducing labor in general. Less bycatch also 

reduces the damage that occurs in the net, relieving fishermen of additional costs in repairs. This also 

prevents loss in commercial catch, such as the observed decrease in catch rate of sole species in the

modified trammel net. The results suggest that the greca modification, or selvedge net, did reduce 

bycatch abundance but, also reduced abundance and earnings in commercial catches. It is concluded that 

further research needs to be conducted on ways toreduce bycatch using trammel nets while maintaining 

similar if not increasing earnings.

Resumo 

O objetivo do presente estudo foi testar redes de tresmalho modificadas, utilizadas 

frequentemente na costa Sul da Europa e Mediterrâneo, com o objetivo de reduzir capturas acidentais. A 

captura acidental ocorre quando espécies não-comerciais ou de baixo valor comercial são capturadas 

pelas redes de pesca e, por isso, são rejeitadas e devolvidas ao mar após a captura. As rejeições são 

assim compostas por espécies que não possuem valor comercial para venda no mercado. Uma espécie 

comercial pode ser também rejeitada devido a reduzido tamanho, a danos provocados pelas artes de 

pesca ou por espécies necrófagos (e.g. anfípodes), ou ainda por imposição legislativa que protege a 

espécie. As redes de pesca, apesar de terem alguma seletividade, são responsáveis por altas taxas de 

pesca acidental e rejeições. As redes de tresmalho são constituidas de três camadas de rede: um painel 

interior de malha pequena e dois painéis exteriores de malha grande. As capturas geralmente passam 

através das redes exteriores, ficando presos em bolsos formados pela combinação das redes exteriores e 

interiores, processo este denominado de  “trammeling”. Na rede modificada testada foi adicionada uma 

camada extra de rede chamada “greca” ou “selvedge net”, que possui três malhas de altura e se situa 

entre o tresmalho e a relinga inferior. Esta porção de rede difere das restantes também no material usado 

na sua construção. 

O principal objetivo do presente estudo foi fornecer provas dos benefícios desta modificação, 

nomeadamente na redução de capturas acidentais, na redução do risco de colapso de stocks pesqueiros, e 

na motivação dos pescadores locais para a adopção do tresmalho modificado (“greca”). Este objetivo foi 

motivado pelas novas politicas da União Europeia ‘A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and 

eliminate discards in European fisheries (COM, 2007)’, que encorajam a adoção de novas tecnologias, 

mesmo que estas impliquem uma diminuição temporária nas taxas de lucro, que possam beneficiar o

futuro da indústria pesqueira que, atualmente, sofre de más práticas de gestão, falta de fiscalização e 

resposta às atividades ilegais. Para este estudo, a amostragem decorreu a bordo de uma embarcação 

pesqueira comercial ao longo da costa do Algarve. A embarcação “Alfonsino” e a sua tripulação 

trabalharam em conjunto com a equipa de investigação e partilharam o tempo passado no mar entre as 

suas próprias redes e os tresmalhos a testar. Todas as saídas de amostragem aconteceram de manhã, a 

partir do porto de Quarteira. As redes foram caladas e deixadas dentro de água durante 

aproximadamente 24 horas. Posteriormente foram aladas através de um guincho metálico e limpas 

manualmente. Os peixes e invertebrados capturados foram identificados sempre que possível até à 

espécie  e medidos ao centímetro. A rede em que cada indivíduo foi capturado, bem como a zona da 

rede e o destino de cada espécimen foi também registado. Em laboratório as imagens obtidas pelas 

câmaras colocadas a bordo (que filmaram todos os momentos das operações de pesca) foram 

cuidadosamente analisadas  para temporizar a remoção de espécies importantes na captura acidental 

(determinadas a priori  pela sua abundância). A abundância foi observada para capturas comerciais e 

rejeições (compostas por capturas comerciais e acidentais) de modo a  comparar os dois tipos de redes. 

A relação peso-comprimento de cada espécie foi usada para calcular e comparar a biomassa das capturas 

em ambas as redes de tresmalho. Os valores de venda em lota por espécie e em cada tipo de rede foram 

calculados com os valores de biomassa das capturas e o preço médio por quilograma de venda. Danos 

infligidos aos dois tipos de redes foram também avaliados após a realização das amostragens, por 

inspeção visual da totalidade das redes. Categorizando a dimensão das aberturas encontradas nas redes 

com base no seu diâmetro, foi possivel fazer a comparação do nível de danos inflingidos aos dois tipos 

de redes utilizados. O sofware PRIMER / PERMANOVA + foi utilizado para avaliar semelhanças entre 

amostragens e os dois tipos de redes, designadamente através das técnicas MDS (Multi-dimensional 

scaling), ANOSIM, (Analysis of similarities), SIMPER (Similarity Percentages) e one-way ou two-way 

PERMANOVA s. Para isso foram usados três fatores para as capturas comerciais, capturas acidentais e 

ambas combinadas: profundidade, espécie alvo e estação do ano. O tipo de rede foi utilizado apenas 

como fator nos dados combinados, uma vez que não apresentou diferenças significativas, com clusters 

de similaridades formados com base nas viagens. Esta análise indicou que a profundidade afeta as 

capturas comerciais nos dois tipos de rede, bem como as capturas totais, que incluem capturas 

comercias, acidentais e rejeições. A profundidade afetou também as capturas acidentais, em conjunto 

com a estação do ano, com níveis de influência semelhantes. A separação entre clusters de similaridades 

por estação foi moderadamente forte. A espécie alvo foi o fator com um efeito mais significativo tanto

nas capturas totais como nas capturas comerciais. A  "Greca" indicou uma abundância de capturas 

comerciais de 53.9% e biomassa de 64.3% comparativamente ao  tresmalho standard. A "Greca" 

produziu 61.8% do valor comercial do tresmalho standard. A diminuição de capturas comerciais foi 

mais intensa para as espécies de linguados (espécies comerciais). Paralelamente, a "Greca" obteve 

igualmente uma redução de 45.3% na abundância de espécies comerciais rejeitadas, e de 57.7% na 

abundância de capturas acidentais. Relativamente à biomassa, a "Greca" obteve um valor de 31.8% de 

rejeições de espécies comerciais e 80.4% da biomassa de capturas acidentais, quando comparado com o 

tresmalho standard. As três principais espécies capturadas acidentalmente foram: ruivo (Chelidonichthys 

obscurus), com uma captura de 37.8% e peixe-aranha (Trachinus draco) com uma captura de 66.9% no 

tresmalho modificado, quando comparadas com as capturas no tresmalho standard. A terceira espécie 

mais capturada acidentalmente foi  cavala (Scomber colias), com uma abundância 28.4% mais elevada no 

tresmalho standard.O tempo de remoção das seis espécies com mais capturas acidentais mostrou a 

importância de reduzir estas capturas, pois a sua remoção das redes consome tempo e aumenta os danos 

infligidos às redes. Estes danos são responsáveis por perdas monetárias através do custo dos reparos e 

diminuição de capturas comerciais, como observado com a catura de solhas no tresmalho modificado. Os 

resultados sugerem que o tresmalho modificado reduziu a abundância das capturas acidentais, mas 

também reduziu a abundância e lucro das capturas comerciais. O resultado indica que será necessária a 

realização de mais estudos de modo a otimizar a rede modificada e reduzir as capturas acidentais 

causadas por redes de tresmalho evitando efeitos negativos  nas vendas em lota efectuadas pelas 

embarcações desta atividade.

1.Introduction 

 

1.1 What are discards? 

 

The fishing industry has evolved as of a result of new onboard technologies spurring a 

growth in the market. This has also caused environmental disasters and even fisheries to collapse due 

to overexploitation and overfishing. A key issue that the world has taken notice of is bycatch and 

discarding practices. Bycatch is the term used when marine species of little or no commercial value 

are accidently caught. The reason for bycatch is often due to being caught alongside targeted species 

that live in the same environment and because some fishing gears lack selectivity. Due to their low 

economic value, bycatch species are often discarded, or thrown away. Commercial species are 

discarded as well but, for various reasons. Some of these include the organism has been scavenged on, 

the species is poisonous, it has the potential to spoil rapidly, there is lack of space onboard, the quotas 

for said species are reached, it is a prohibited species to catch or caught with prohibited gear, the 

organism has parasites, there are visible signs of damage from the gear, the organism is too small to 

catch or is considered a juvenile, it is the wrong sex, or it is incompatible with the rest of the catch 

(Hall et al., 2000). In recent years, the average of discards for commercial fisheries has been 27 

million tons per year, varying from 17.9 million tons to as high as 39.5 million tons (Alverson et al., 

1994). Although discarding and bycatch are believed to be problematic, there is no agreement upon an 

exact definition of these two terms regarding fisheries, the impact on both bycatch and commercial 

species’ population, the impacts on the ecosystem, and the ethics of fishing (Borges et al., 2001). 

However, some researchers have noticed that certain bycatch species pose problems for fishermen due 

to reduction in net area, and an increase in labor time due to the need to disentangle species from the 

nets within their fisheries (Metin et al., 2009). 

On a global scale, there is not enough research on understanding the effects of bycatch. 

According to ICCAT1, IATTC2, IOTC3, and SPC4 there are 37 fishing nations that use pelagic gillnets 

or driftnets of which only 5 have observer programs that gather data on bycatch. In comparison there 

are 14 nations that use trawls with 4 having observer programs, 40 nations using pelagic longlines of 

which only 15 have observer programs, and 62 nations that use purse seines of which only 10 nations 

have observer programs (Lewison et al., 2004). Prior to tackling the problems of bycatch and discards

in these countries, research must be conducted in order to understand the magnitude of the problem. 

This is especially neccessary in countries with little or no legislation that controls fishing methods in 

order to prevent a collapse which would affect the economy and the people involved in the fishing 

industry. 

 

1.2 The ban on discards in the E.U. 

The European Union legislation established a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and 

eliminate discards in European fisheries (COM, 2007). This policy discusses the issues being faced 

due to discarding, the measures required to prompt a discards ban, and how the ban  will  affect  the  

economy.  In the initial article, the legislation encourages  new technology  in  an  effort  to  avoid  the  

necessity  of  discarding.  The section highlights the importance of regulating what is caught rather 

than regulating landings, meaning all individuals of all species (commercial or bycatch) caught will be 

brought to port. The second article discusses the effects, causes, and extent of discards, highlighting the 

effect on biodiversity in terms of reproduction and sensitivity to damage by specific gear. The section 

continues by identifying specific areas in Europe and the comparison of bycatch rates based on the 

commonly used gears of each area. The third article deliberates how to move towards a discard ban and 

reduction of by-catch progressively, giving international examples and the terms that discarding would 

fall under along with the exceptions.  

Additional instruments and supplements that can be useful are suggested such as fees on 

bycatch and obligatory switching of fishing grounds. Instead of specifications for the gears, there will 

be requirements for specific results. This would permit the fisheries to decide what is most practical 

and economic prompting a discussion between researchers, fishermen, and the auction officials. The 

fourth article focuses on monitoring and controlling the fisheries due to areas that have little or weak 

enforcement if a ban is put into effect. It references how to enforce the ban using an observer scheme 

which includes careful monitoring of landings, an electronic log book, monitoring and control of gear, 

and stakeholders involvements and cooperation. The fifth section considers the social impact of the 

policy and what the incentives to change will be. In the short-term this change in policy can result in 

cost increase and losses in income. However, in the long term this policy will result in larger and 

healthier stocks, which will result in increased fishing opportunities over the course of many years.

1.3 Small scale fisheries in Portugal  

It is imperative to control the amount of fishing occurring in each country, especially 

those that rely on fishing as it pertains heavily to the nation’s economy. Small scale fisheries are 

responsible for the majority of seafood sold in the market worldwide. In European waters, there are 

nearly 75,000 vessels that are less than 12 m and the majority are involved in small scale fisheries 

(Stergiou et al. 2006) or artisanal fishing. A significant amount of the Portuguese fleet is considered 

small scale fisheries with the majority of targeted stocks being demersal species, or species that dwell 

on or near the ocean floor (Table 1.3.1).

In Portugal, nets, which include trammel and gill nets, have the second highest number of 

licenses right after longlines (Table 1 . 3 . 2), with trammel nets accounting for 18% of all small 

scale fisheries licenses in the Algarve (Stergiou et al., 2006). The only exception to this is North 

Portugal where trawls were second to nets in the amount of licenses issued in 2015.

These licenses (Table 1.3.2) represent an overview of gears in general terms grouped into 

categories. Traps most commonly used in areas such as the Algarve include: metal frames with hard 

plastic netting with a single entry of octopi, large traps with metal frames for both fish and cuttlefish, 

and wire traps for fish (Erzini, 2008). The trawls category include multiple gears such as bivalve 



4 

 

dredges, “otter trawls”, and beam trawls. It is important to note that although there is a specific 

number of licenses for each of the categories, these numbers do not necessarily indicate the number of 

vessels using solely the specific gear as most vessels have licenses for more than one gear. More than 

90% of fishing vessels in Portugal are licensed to use multiple types of gear (Baeta et al., 2009) as 

seen in Table 1.3.3 (Polyvalent fishing).

1.4 Trammel nets and Bycatch 

 

Bycatch and discarding heavily affects biodiversity in terms of reducing the populations of 

predator and prey species to unsustainable levels (Gilman et al., 2008). The fishing industry has had a 

great effect on trophic level interactions and the food web. Globally, due to fisheries landings, trophic 

levels have been declining at a rate of 0.1 per decade, even though landings have not significantly 

increased (Pauly et al., 1997). Static nets are destroying the environment, disturbing food web 

interactions among trophic levels, and affecting future catch rates. In a study regarding the effect of 

different gears on trophic levels, trammel nets were responsible for the catch of over 50% of omnivores 

that prefer other animals, over 25% of carnivores that prefer decapods, and about 20% of carnivores 

with a preference for fish and cephalopods (Stergiou et al., 2007). 

Several types of fishing gears are used in the marine environment ranging from gears that 

require a crew such as static nets and trawlers, to gears that can be operated by a single fisherman such 

as fishing poles and pots. An important static gear in coastal waters worldwide is the trammel net 



5 

 

(Gonçalves et al. 2008). Similar to other gear, trammel nets differ in design depending on the target 

catch and the environment. In general, trammel nets have three panels of netting which are made up 

of either multifilament or monofilament. There is a loose small mesh inner panel (hanging ratio 

ranges from 0.3 to 0.5) between two larger mesh panels (hanging ratio are usually more than 0.5) and 

a vertical slack ( the ratio of the height of the small-meshed inner panel to large-meshed outer 

panels) that usually ranges from 2.0 to 3.0 (Erzini et al. 2006). The bottom of the net is connected to a 

lead line and floats are attached to the top of the net. In comparison to gillnets that are designed to 

wedge, entangle, or gill a fish, trammel nets are also capable of catching fish and invertebrates by 

“pocketing” or trammeling which consists of the fish being pushed through one of the outer larger mesh 

panels into a pocket formed by the inner smaller mesh (Fabi et al., 2002). The selectivity of size is 

restricted with very little fish being caught that are more than 20% smaller or 20% larger than the 

optimum length of the mesh size (Aydin et al., 2015). There is also the semi-trammel net which differs 

in the fact that there is only one layer of outer webbing (Thomas 2002).  

When a single gear targets a specific species during a particular time of year, this is called a 

métier.  In the Algarve, there are four important métiers for trammel nets. Sepia officinalis and 

Solea species are caught year round by a variety of trammel nets while Pagrus species, which are 

usually caught in summer, and Lophius piscatorius both require larger vessels and specific trammel 

nets (Erzini et al. 2001). 

Since some  gear  is static,  such  as trammel  nets,  initial  catches becomes easy prey for 

predators.  Often  when  nets are  pulled up  bycatch  species  have  already been  picked  apart. 

Mortality is also inevitable for some individuals upon being hauled onboard. A schematic drawn by 

Gasper and Chicharo (2007) displays all these possibilities resulting in either direct or indirect 

mortality in Figure 1.4.1. Some are dropped on the deck and left to die as fishermen work quickly 

and have no concern for the species while other individuals are ripped apart or smashed out of the 

net for efficiency purposes. Certain species pose a danger to the fishermen and therefore are killed to 

prevent any onboard injuries. While some make it off board, seagulls trail the boats and are in close 

enough proximity to grab the organism before there is a chance for it to swim away. In some cases, 

juveniles and pre-spawning or sexually immature organisms are caught. In the circumstance  where  

these  individuals  are  disposed  of  immediately,  there  is  still  a  risk  of mortality prior to spawning 

if the species is sensitive and damage that the gear has done is considerable. Discarding can severely 



6 

 

affect recruitment in fisheries resulting in a loss of reproduction rate when a large number of discards 

are commercial juveniles (Jensen et al., 1988). 

 

 

 
 

Figure 1.4.1. Schematic of indirect or direct mortality resulting from bycatch and discards (Source: Gaspar and 

Chicharo, 2007). 
 

As mentioned before, some of these discards are supplying the food web with easy prey for 

predatory organisms such as seagulls and dolphins that trail the boat. Discards are believed to be 

dangerous for seabirds as this type of food is considered to be junk food for them (Österblom et al., 

2008). However, some species of gulls (Audouin’s gulls) receive a substancial part of their energy from 

fishery discards during the breeding season (Oro and Ruiz, 1997). In a study where reduction of 

discards for seabirds was conducted, researchers observed there was no attraction to the boat, 

resulting in decreased mortality rates due to a decline in seabird - gear interaction (Granadeiro et 

al., 2011). With mammals, dolphins are known to become entangled in trammel and gill nets, often 

being severely injured and possibly dying (Ross et al., 2010). Fishermen have reported dolphins that 

destroy their nets and would create competition between themselves and the fishermen resulting in 

deliberate killing of dolphins by angered fishermen (Gazo et al., 2007). Trammel nets have been 

reported as being responsible for a mortality rate of 60% ofsea turtles caught in the net, by incidental 

capture of the loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in places such as Sardinia, Italy (Cambie, 2011). 

Attempts to reduce bycatch of these important species have been successful in some cases while in 

others they have affected commercial catch rates. In Mexico’s Baja California peninsula, researchers 

attempted to use visual cues to reduce sea turtle bycatch in static gear by using shark shapes which did 



7 

 

in fact reduce turtle bycatch by 54%, but also decreased target catch by 45%, while chemical light 

sticks did not affect the target catch and reduced sea turtle catch rates by 60% (Wang et al., 2010). 

Ultimately, important prey is being taken away from commercial species, resulting in increased 

competition and a decrease in population size as the species’ food beings to disappear. Various gears 

have different results regarding the catch of fish; for trawls targeting haddock, discard related 

mortality can range from 9-35% versus haddock caught by seine nets which is less than 10%. In 

gear such as hook and lines, Salmo species have a post release mortality of 0% even with visible stress 

while the pacific salmon caught in static gear such as gillnets have a mortality rate of 80% due to stress 

(Chopin and Arimoto 1995). Some species are less sensitive than others to mortality after catch. For 

example, if caught as bycatch, sharks and rays have higher survival rates than most teleost’s 

(Rodríguez-Cabello et al., 2005). 

Bycatch has an impact on VMEs, or Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems. Passive gear, such as 

trammel nets, can result in entangling of branching corals (High, 1998) and upon hauling, coral will be 

broken and torn out of the sea floor. There is also the possibility of abrasions and crushing of 

benthic fauna (Lewis et al., 2009). Corals and marine plants serve as protection to many species and 

serve as nurseries while benthic fauna is often responsible for bottom up control in that these species 

serve an important part in the food web. VME’s are defined by their uniqueness, which include rare species; 

critical feeding, spawning, or nursey habitats; fragility or easily degraded from human interactions; late 

maturations or slow growth; and low levels of natural disturbances (Donaldson et al., 2010). Upon 

interaction with static gear, these areas are highly susceptible to deterioration, resulting in a significant 

decrease in biodiversity. 

 

1.5 Discards in the Algarve  

The percentage and abundance of both bycatch and commercial catch depends on the type of 

gear as well as the environment it is fishing in. Longlining, has a set number of hooks and therefore 

only a set number of organisms can be caught while trawls are usually large and because they 

move along with the boat they are more likely to catch a larger variety of species. Static gear such as 

gill nets and trammel nets are more variable as their size selection is variable. In the Algarve, the mean 

discard rate for trammel nets was reported at 13% of total catch in comparison to other gear including 

demersal purse seines and fish trawls that had discard rates of 20% and 62% respectively (Borges et 

al., 2001). In another study based on multiple gears in Portugal, trawls and purse seiners were 



8 

 

responsible for 90% of discards (mainly fish and cephalopods) and trammel nets followed with 81% 

in discards (Borges et al., 2001). According to Kelleher (2005) the highest global discard percentages 

are due to shrimp trawls, ranging from 0-96%; demersal finfish trawls, ranging 0.5-83%; and gillnets 

(including trammel nets), ranging from 0-66%. 

Commercial catch and bycatch is also dependent on the season. In a trammel net study 

conducted in Setubal and Sesimbra,  Sepia officinalis was caught in higher numbers during 

autumn and winter while Solea senegalensis was more prevalent during spring and summer but, was 

caught year round (Batista, 2009). The most widely discarded invertebrate species in winter and 

summer is Phallusia mammillata and during Autumn it is Sphaerechinus granularis (Gonçalves et al., 

2008). In a study based on five different métiers in Algarve, Portugal, trammel nets were responsible 

for the discardg  of 78 species (Erzini et al., 2002). Common commercial  species  in  Portugal  

consist  of  cuttlefish  (Sepia  officialis),  and  soles  Solea senegalensis which are discarded at 

6% and 12.4%, respectively, while bycatch commonly consists of Scomber japonicus, Sardina 

pilchardus, and Boops boops (Gonçlaves et al., 2007). 

 

1.6 Bycatch Problems and Solutions  

Bycatch and discarding creates a problem both socioeconomically and environmentally. It is a 

nuisance for fishermen as their gear is affected negatively as mentioned previously. In some 

circumstances, a bycatch species has spines, scales, or teeth that are caught in the net and the only 

way to clean the net is by ripping these species out, leaving holes and ripped up mesh that will no  

longer  be  effective  in  catching the  target  species.  Researchers have already begun attempting to 

resolve issues with top predator species such as dolphins, which destroy nets, by using pingers on 

trammel nets; while dolphins did not decrease in approaching the net, there was 87% less holes in the 

nets with pingers (Gazo et al., 2007). Cleaning the net of bycatch species forces the fishermen to lose 

time that would otherwise be used on cleaning the net of commercial fishes and arriving in the port 

earlier to the morning auction. 

Currently, legislation is seeking to encourage the development of technologies that can result in  

elimination  of  discards.  There have been  several  approaches  to  management  of harvesting 

commercial catch while decreasing bycatch and discards and showing success. When conducting  

research  on  bycatch  reduction using a trammel net rigged with a guarding net in the Northeastern 

Mediterranean, Gökçe et al. (2016) reported that the ‘ANet’ or the alternative net (modified net) 



9 

 

exhibited 83% less bycatch than the ‘CNet’ (commercial net) and only 16% less commercial catch. 

Overall, the modification produced a 1.5% decrease in catches of the main target species, green tiger 

prawn, Penaeus semisulcatus, and 66-85% decrease in the three main bycatch species (invasive 

swimming crab, Charybdes longicollis; mantis shrimp, Rissoides desmaresti; and the blue crab, 

Portunus pelagicus). A study in the Eastern Mediterranean in Antalya Bay, found that a smaller mesh 

size for the inner panel (40mm or 44 mm) resulted in higher amount of commercial catch in both 

abundance and biomass for the species like Pagellus acarne in which 164 individuals (6.209 grams) 

were caught in the 44 mm net versus 774 individuals (31.219 kg) in the 40 mm net. There was also a 

decrease in bycatch, halving the abundance and biomass of individuals for species like Citharus 

linguatula where 70 individuals (2.079 kg) were caught in the 44 mm net versus 35 individuals (0.959 

kg) in the 40 mm net (Olguner and Deval, 2013).  

In Izmir Bay of the Aegean coast in Turkey, researchers added a guarding net to the common 

trammel net being used in the area to raise it from the muddy bottom focusing on the commercial 

fishery of the prawn Melicertus kerathurus (Metin et al., 2009). The alternative net went through two 

rounds of experiments because in the first there were too may floats resulting in a 17% decrease in 

commercial catch. However, in the second experiment there was only a 0.99% decrease in the prawn 

catch for significant reductions in the three main bycatch species: crabs (50.63%), mantis shrimp 

(17.33%), and purple dye murex (25.92%). The results thus show that a guarding net in this area can 

reduce bycatch and highlights the importance of height of the guarding net regarding bycatch reduction. 

Another project in Izmir Bay regarding trammel net discard reduction focused on Mullus spp in 

seagrass meadows (Aydin et al., 2013). Discard rates decreased 54.7% in the first experiment and 

62.8% in the second experiment using a selvedge. The selvedge reduced the discard of three main 

bycatch species (Hexaplex trunculus, Bolinus brandaris, Maja spp) which ultimately avoided damage 

to the net caused by these species.  In the Kerala state in India, researchers surveyed net usage along 16 

districts and noticed trammel nets being used for soles, mackerel, and prawn during different periods of 

the year, signifying the awareness that switching gear is efficient and that it ensures targeting of 

specific species and avoidance of juveniles and bycatch (Thomas and Hridayanathan 2006). 

 

1.7 The Greca net goals  

There is still a significant amount of information that all fisheries require in order to make 

informative decisions regarding future management. In conclusion, scientific research is needed to gain 



10 

 

the knowledge that will enable proper maintenance for a sustainable fishery for not only 

environmental purposes but, economic ones as well. The goal of this project is to produce enough 

evidence to convince fishermen to switch from the standard trammel net to the modified trammel net. The 

modified net’s success will be proven if there is no reduction in commercial catch compared to the 

standard net while the bycatch  is reduced significantly.  The reduction  of bycatch  will be d e p e n de n t  on 

the greca’s design (the selvedge). For the commercial catch to remain unaffected, the target species 

must be compatible with the new design. With less bycatch, the time to clean the net will also be 

reduced. This is important for fishermen as they can focus on commercial species, get to port before 

the morning auction, and less bycatch species in the net can result in more space in the net for 

commercial catch. A reduction in time for cleaning the net of bycatch species means less time on the 

boat and quicker setting time for the next day. Goals also include the reduction of bycatch in terms of 

the ecosystem. This ultimately can prevent severe population collapse in key species that either serve 

as food for others in the food web or serve as control for species that are their food source. With a 

decline in species that are important food sources for commercial species, there is a potential collapse 

of these fisheries which can be devastating to the economy. The specific objectives of this research 

were: 1)  to compare a standard trammel net with a modified trammel net (greca) in terms of catch 

compostion, bycatch and discard species, 2) compare the economic yield of the standard net with that of 

the modified net, 3) compare the time needed to clean the different nets (removal of bycatch and 

discard species), and 4) compare net damage in the standard trammel net and the greca net.  

 

2.Materials and Methods 

 

2.1 Net Design  
 

The standard trammel net consists of three layers of netting: a small mesh inner panel and two 

large mesh outer panels. The modified net has a single layer of netting 3 meshes high between the 

trammel net and the footrope termed “greca”. The difference can be seen in Figure 2.1.1. The experimental 

nets consisted of fifteen 45-meter nets of each type tied together. There were  three standard and three 

modified nets interchanging five times giving (SN1...SN5 &amp;amp; GN1..GN5), with two meters in between 

each section to reduce bias (guiding of fish), making up a total of approximately 1.5 kilometers of net. 

In the standard net (Figure 2.1.2), the inner panel has a stretched mesh size of 120 of 0.30 mm diameter 

(0.30 Ø) monofilament. The net is 40 meshes high, or 4.80 m stretched mesh, by 995 meshes long, or 

119.4m stretched mesh. The floatline was 52 m long and made of PE with 7mm in diameter. The 



11 

 

number of poach lines between the floats was 10. The leadline was 55.2m long and made of PE, or 

polyester, (braided line with lead) with 7mm in diameter. The upper hanging ratio and lower hanging 

ratio were 0.43 and 0.46, respectively and were calculated as follows:  

 

 

 

The number of meshes per poach line for both upper and lower was five (five meshes on the 

bottom and five meshes at the top). The material for the floats were polyethylene and were 50 mm in 

length The outer panels have a stretched mesh size of 600mm of 0.60 mm diameter (0.60 Ø) 

monofilament. For the outer panel, the number of meshes high was 3, or 1.8 m stretched mesh, by 199 

meshes long, or 119.4m. The hanging ratio for both upper and lower was identical to the inner panel. 

The vertical slack was 2.7 and was calculated by the following:

The modified net (Figure 2.1.2) had similar measurements for the outer and inner panels. The 

selvedge, or greca, (Figure 2.1.3) consisted of a single panel 3 meshes high, of 140 mm stretched mesh 

(210/12 PA).

The two métiers that this research focused on are Solea species and Sepia officinalis. Solea 

species was the initial métier during autumn and S. officinalis was caught in winter time when the 

water temperature decreased.  
 

 

2.2 Experimental fishing trials 
 

Fishing was conducted off the coast of Algarve with the fishing vessel (Alfonsinho) departing 

from the port of Quarteria, Portugal (Figure 2.2.1). Twenty sampling trips were conducted f r om 

O c t o b e r  2 0 1 6 t o Fe b r u a r y 2 0 1 7 .  The nets were set at dawn and hauled in the next morning; 

this usually occurred before sunrise with the goal of keeping the soak time (the time the net is in the 

water) standard (approximately 24 hours). The two times that were crucial to record were the setting 

time the day before and the hauling time the day of sampling. It is important to note that sampling was 

not conducted under conditions of high biomasses of the algae Cystoeria in the water as it blocked the 

net and prevented any catch from occurring. Two GoPros were set up on board to use as references and 

to record possible overlook of species in the net. GoPro videos were used later to evaluate the time 

required to clean the two different nets. The net was pulled in using a hydraulic hauler.  Each marine  

organism  caught  in  the  net  was identified (to the species level) and measured, using either a ruler 

connected to a stable metal platform (ichthyometer) or if the species was too large with a measuring 

tape, and registered as bycatch or commercial. If the organism  was considered “bycatch”  or simply 



13 

 

discard,  as some commercial species can also be considered discard, then the reason was noted. 

Some reasons that are possible include too small to sell, scavenged, rotting, or contains parasites. For 

each species the net type was recorded. Futhermore, for species caught in the modified net, it was 

recorded whether it was caught in the upper trammel net part or the “greca” part. 

 

 

 

Figure 2.2.1. The location where experimental fishing trials took place. The shaded area, off the port of Quarteria, 

Portugal, is where the experimental fishing trials took place. 

 

 

Each fish was removed from the net manually by the fishermen. Certain bycatch species 

were killed in order to clean the net and t o  continue h a u l i n g  a t  a moderate pace. For 

instance, the sea urchin (Sphaerochinus granularis) was usually crushed by the fisherman, while the 

sea snail (Cymbium olla) was ripped out of its shell. Trachinus draco and the electric ray Torpedo 

torpedo had their heads crushed to avoid injuries. Special care is taken with species such as 

Rhizomata pulmo, the barrel jellyfish, which was carefully taken out to avoid stings as they are quite 

large organisms. 



14 

 

GPS tracking was used to note the waypoints (where each net is set). Wind conditions 

(recorded onboard), water conditions (including water temperatures, salinity, dissolved oxygen in 

both percentage and mg/L format, and total dissolved solids), sunrise and sunset time were also 

recorded in order to track external condition. This data was also used to compare the catch based on 

the differences in daily conditions. 

 

2.3 Net Damage Assessment  

The damage to the net was accounted for by counting every visible hole across the entire 1.5 km 

of net at the end of the experimental trials. As the net was pulled onto the deck and onto a black tarp for 

easy visualization, four observers checked the section of the net for holes and it was noted in which net 

type (modified or standard) the hole was in. Upon spotting a hole, a 20 cm ruler was placed on the hole 

to observe the width/diameter and a picture was taken for later analysis (Figure 2.3.1). Each hole was 

observed using three factors: 1) which layer the hole occurred (greca layer, inner layer, or outer layer), 

2) where the net occurred (either the lower half of the net or the upper half of the net), and 3) size of the 

net (hole size &amp;lt;20 cm was considered small and hole size &gt; 20 cm was considered large). This 

information was used in accounting for the differences in catch between the modified greca net and the 

standard net.

2.4 Analysis 

 

The weight of each fish was calculated using weight -length relationships, in order to estimate 

value of the catch based on average selling price for the day and the catch biomass. In order to do 

this, the equation below was used: 

 
 

Where a and b are parameters for the weight-length relationship and given based on country by 

fishbase.org for  each  individual  species.  For the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  Portuguese 

coefficients were used, Algarve if possible, otherwise Portugal in general or if neither was an option, a 

Mediterranean country. The weight of octopi (Octopus vulgaris) was estimated by the fishermen. The 

other commercial invertebrates such as the spider crab (Maja brachydactyla) and cuttlefish (Sepia 

officialis) were weighed on board measured to for weight to length relationships. The total catches (kg) 

of each species were converted to value in euros using the average price per kg obtained at the f i s h  

auction in Quarteria, Portugal (Doca Pesca). The weight of each bycatch species was also  

recorded to compare the two net types. 

Analysis was conducted using PRIMER and PERMANOVA  in order to evaluate differences 

between the catch compositions of the two different types of trammel net. The idea is to compare 

d i s c a r d s ,  commercial catch, and the combined cath data between the two net types. Data sheets 

were prepared in excel using pivot tables. Trip number and net type ( e.g. T16: T -standard net, 16 - trip 

16) were assigned as the samples samples and the species were assigned variables. There were a total of 

6 excel files: 1) commercial catch abundance, 2) commercial catch biomass, 3) bycatch abundance, 4) 

bycatch biomass, 5) combined catch abundance, and 6) combined catch biomass. Each of these files 

were input into PRIMER and analyzed using one of three main factors: target catch (10 trips where sole 

species were target and 10 trips where cuttlefish were targeted), season (15 trips where sampling was 

conducted during fall and 5 trips where sampling was conducted during winter), and depth that was 

decided after sampling using bathmetric ranges (10-20 meters was the range for 12 trip and 20-30 m 

was the range for 8 trips).  Net type was also used as a factor but, only for the combined catch data and 

for two-way PERMANOVA s, to observe the interaction effect, which included the following: net type 

against depth, net type against season, and net type against target catch. Cluster analysis,  MDS (Multi-

Demensional Scaling), Anisom (Analysis in Similarity), and SIMPER (Similarity Percentage 

Analsysis) were conducted with the PRIMER software both with and without square root 



16 

 

transformation. It was later decided that analysis based on the square root transformation was more 

appropriate, giving lower positive stress levels and higher significance in PERMANOVA  and 

ANOSIM. Two-way PERMANOVA s were used to compare the interaction effect between net type 

and the three main factors.  

 

3. Results 

 

3.1 Abundance  
 

 When comparing the abundance of commercial species that were landed and sold between the 

standard and the modified net (greca) it appears that 19 species were either caught in one net  or the 

other, with 21 species caught by both nets (Table 3.1.1). The overall ratio (total number of commercial 

species caught) for greca to standard net was 0.539, showing that the standard net caught more than the 

greca net. At the species level this occurred 15 times, with the smallest ratios being less than 0.4 

occurring for three sole species: Microchirus azevia, Pegusa Lascaris, and Solea senegalensis. If the 

ratio is more than one then the standard net caught less of the species than the greca net and this occured 

four times with the highest ratio being 1.5 for the species Mullus surmuletus, followed by a ratio of 1.4 

for the species Raja undulata.

 The abundance of discards was split into two sections: one for discarded commercial species, 

reasons for this include scavenged, parasites, decay, or identified as undersized or juvenile, (Table 3.1.2 

and bycatch species (Table 3.1.3). If the ratio of greca to standard net is less than one, then the standard 

net caught more discarded individuals. If the ratio of greca to standard net is more than one, then the 

greca net caught more discarded individuals. The ratio of greca trammel net catches to standard trammel 

net catches in numbers for commercial discards was 0.432, while for bycatch it was 0.584, and the 

overall ratio was 0.557. The two most discarded commercial species were Pagellus erythrinus with a 

ratio of 0.457 and Microchirus azevia with a ratio of 0.382; both species were discarded in higher 

numbers in the standard net. Over 200 individuals were caught for three bycatch species. 

Chelidonichthys obscurus, with 288 individuals caught and a ratio of 0.378, was caught more often in 

the standard net than the greca net. Scomber colias, with 233 individuals caught and a ratio of 1.284, 

was caught more often in the greca net than the standard net. Lastly, for Trachinus draco, with 202 

individuals caught and a ratio of 0.669, 40% were caught in the greca net and 60% in the standard net.

The biomass of discarded species is separated into two tables: The abundance of discards was 

split into two sections: one for discarded commercial species (reasons for this includes scavenged, 

parasites, decay, or marked as juvenile, (Table 3.2.2) and bycatch species (Table 3.2.3). The discard 

ratio of the greca to standard net for commercial catch is 0.318, bycatch discard 0.804, and the overall 

ratio was 0.607. The species with the highest discarded weight in the greca net were Balistes capriscus 

(1.859 kg) and Microchirus azevia (1.465 kg). The species with the highest discarded weight in the 

standard net were Raja undulata (5.687 kg), Sepia officinalis (5.508 kg), and Microchirus azevia (3.601 

kg). Regarding bycatch species, 14.483 kg of Chelidonichthys obscurus were discarded from the greca 

net and 33.253 kg were discarded from the standard net. 7.082 kg of the species Trachinus draco was 

discarded from the greca net and 11.187 kg from the standard net. Lastly, 6.470 kg of Scomber colias 

was discarded from the greca net and 5.858 kg discarded from the standard net.

3.3 Factor: Net Type  

 

 Similarities for combined catch (commercial catch, commercial discards, and bycatch) appear 

among trips when using net type as a factor. For abundance (Figure 3.3.1a), it is noted that trip 19’s 

catch from both the greca and standard had a resemblance level of less than 30. It was later observed 

when focusing on discard and bycatch biomass and abundance that the two net types were outliers. This 

is due to the fact that more than 50% of the catch was commercial and therefore trip 19 as a whole is 

excluded from the data sets using strictly discards and bycatch. Trip 9’s catch from the greca net was 

also considered an outlier with a resemblance level of less than 20. This is because the greca net did not 

catch any commercial individuals during that trip and was therefore excluded from the data sets using 

strictly commercial catch. Similar results can be seen in biomass (Figure 3.3.1b), with a resemblance 

level of around 40 for trip 19’s greca and standard net catch . Although trip 9’s catch in the greca net had 

a resemblance level less than 20, it has a similarity with trip 1’s catch from the greca net and this is 

because only 9.8% of the catch was considered commercial.

3.4 Factor: Seasonality  

Figures 3.4.1a and 3.4.1b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of commercial catch. 

The stress factors are 0.16 and 0.17 for abundance and biomass, respectively, which is a fair goodness of 

fit. ANOSIM for commercial abundance and biomass with a square root transformation gave a global R 

values of 0.124 and 0.11 and significance levels of 2.2% and 1.9% meaning that that with seasonal 

variation the separation is significant. This is further supported by a p-value of 0.006 and 0.008 in 

PERMANOVA. In SIMPER (Figure II and Figure III), there is support for strong dissimilarity (83.29%) 

between fall and winter and with average similarity between the trips of 19.94% in fall and 26.49% in 

winter for abundance as well as a strong dissimilarity (83.54%) between fall and winter and with 

average similarity between the trips of 19.34% in fall and 24.99% in winter for biomass. 

 
Figure 3.4.1a. MDS plot, with a square root transformation, for the abundance and b. biomass  of commercial species 
caught within 20 trips in each type of net excluding the greca for trip 9 (M=Modified Trammel; T=Standard Trammel) with 
seasonal variation (either fall or winter). 
 

Figures 3.4.2a and 3.4.2b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of bycatch. The 

stress factors are 0.19 and 0.20 for abundance and biomass, respectively, which is a fair goodness of fit. 

ANOSIM for commercial abundance and biomass with a square root transformation have a global R of 

0.438 and 0.308, respectively, signifying moderately strong seperations. Abundance and biomass have a 

significance level of 0.1% and 1.3% meaning that that with seasonal variation the separation is 

significant. This is further supported by a p-value of 0.002 and 0.016 in PERMANOVA . In SIMPER 

(Figure IV and Figure V), there is support for strong dissimilarity (75.87%) between fall and winter and 

with average similarity between the trips of 37.3% in fall and 24.84% in winter for abundance as well as 

a strong dissimilarity (73.89%) between fall and winter and with average similarity between the trips of 

36.47% in fall and 21.39% in winter for biomass.

Figures 3.4.3a and 3.4.3b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of combined catch 

data. The stress factors are 0.17 and 0.21 for abundance and biomass, respectively, which is a fair 

goodness of fit for abundance and a poor goodness of fit for biomass. ANOSIM for commercial 

abundance and biomass with a square root transformation have  global Rs of 0.468 and 0.28 signifying 

seperations that are moderate in strength. Abundance and biomass both have a significance level of 

0.1%, meaning that that with seasonal variation the separation is significant. This is further supported by 

a p-value of 0.002 and 0.016 in PERMANOVA. In SIMPER (Figure VI and Figure VII), there is support

separation between the two target catch species. Abundance and biomass have a significance level of 

0.1% and 0.1% meaning that that with a variation in target catch the separation is significant. This is 

further supported by a p-value of 0.001 and 0.001 in PERMANOVA. In SIMPER (Figure VIII and 

Figure IX), there is support for strong dissimilarity (90.97%) between sole species and cuttlefish and 

with average similarity between the trips of 28.95% for sole species and 31.41% for cuttlefish for 

abundance as well as a strong dissimilarity (90.97%) between cuttlefish and sole species and with 

average similarity between the trips of 27.31% for sole species and 29.31% for cuttlefish for biomass.

Figure 3.5.1a. MDSplot, based on square root transformation of abundance and b. of biomass  of commercial species 
caught within 20 trips in each type of net excluding the greca for trip 9 (M=Modified Trammel; T=Standard Trammel) with 
variation in métier (sole species or cuttlefish). 
 

Figures 3.5.2a and 3.5.2b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of bycatch with 

target catch as the factor. The stress factors are 0.19 and 0.2 for abundance and biomass, respectively, 

which is a fair goodness of fit for both. ANOSIM for commercial abundance and biomass with a square 

root transformation have global R values of 0.368 and 0.154 respectively, signifying a moderate and 

weak strength in seperation between the two target catch species. Abundance and biomass have a 

significance level of 0.1% and 0.1% meaning that that with a variation in target catch the separation is 

significant. This is further supported by a p-value of 0.001 and 0.002 in PERMANOVA. In SIMPER 

(Figure X and Figure XI), there is support for strong dissimilarity (73.64%) between sole species and 

cuttlefish and with average similarity between the trips of 42.49% for sole species and 28.82% for 

cuttlefish for abundance as well as a strong dissimilarity (70.88%) between cuttlefish and sole species 

and with average similarity between the trips of 38.93% for sole species and 27.32% for cuttlefish for 

biomass.

within 19 trips in each type of net (M=Modified Trammel; T=Standard Trammel) with variation in target catch (sole species 
or cuttlefish). 
 

Figures 3.5.3a and 3.5.3b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of combined catch 

data with target catch as the factor. The stress factors are 0.17 and 0.21 for abundance and biomass, 

respectively, which is a fair goodness of fit for abundance but, a poor goodness of fit for biomass. 

ANOSIM for commercial abundance and biomass with a square root transformation gave  global R 

values of 0.591 and 0.511 respectively, signifying a strong separation between the two target catch 

species. Abundance and biomass have a significance level of 0.1% and 0.1% meaning that that with a 

variation in target catch the separation is significant. This is further supported by  p-values of 0.001 in 

PERMANOVA. In SIMPER (Figure XII and Figure XIII), there is support for strong dissimilarity 

(79.57%) between sole species and cuttlefish and with average similarity between the trips of 41.79% 

for sole species and 30.83% for cuttlefish for abundance as well as a strong dissimilarity (80.64%)

3.6 Factor: Depth  

 

Figures 3.6.1a and 3.6.1b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of commercial catch 

with depth as the factor. The stress factors are 0.17 and 0.17 for abundance and biomass, respectively, 

which is a fair goodness of fit for both. ANOSIM for commercial abundance and biomass with a square 

root transformation gave global R values of 0.586 and 0.545 signifying a strong separation between the 

two depth ranges. Abundance and biomass have a significance level of 0.1% and 0.1% meaning that that 

with a variation in depth the separation is significant. This is further supported by a p-value of 0.001 and 

0.001 in PERMANOVA. In SIMPER (Figure XIV and Figure XV), there is support for strong 

dissimilarity (93.72%) between two depth ranges (10-20m and 20-30m) and with average similarity 

between the trips of 22.74% for first depth range (10-20m) and 30.26% for the second depth range (20-

30m) for abundance as well as a strong dissimilarity (92.24%) between two depth ranges (10-20m and 

20-30m) and with average similarity between the trips of 20.33% for first depth range (10-20m) and 

26.29% for the second depth range (20-30m). 

For the abundance there is a resemblance level of 30 for most of the trips where the net was at a 

depth between 10 and 20 meters and a resemblance level of 55 among the majority of the trips where the 

net was at a depth between 20 and 30 meters in the standard (T) trammel net (Figure 16a). For biomass 

there a resemblance level of 30 for the majority of the trips where the net was at a depth between 10 and 

20 meters (Figure 16b). A resemblance level of 50 was associated with standard nets and similar depth 

ranges. In both abundance and biomass, greca (M) trammel nets did not have a higher resemblance level 

with either greca nets in similar depth ranges nor with standard trammel nets.

Figures 3.6.2a and 3.6.2b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of bycatch with 

depth as the factor. The stress factors are 0.19 and 0.20 for abundance and biomass, respectively, which 

is a fair goodness of fit for both. ANOSIM for commercial abundance and biomass with a square root 

transformation have a global R of 0.547 and 0.286 signifying a strong separation between the two depth 

ranges for abundance while a weak strength in biomass. Abundance and biomass have a significance 

level of 0.1% and 0.1% meaning that that with a variation in depth the separation is significant. This is 

further supported by a p-value of 0.001 and 0.002 in PERMANOVA. In SIMPER (Figure XVI and 

Figure XVII), there is support for strong dissimilarity (80.33%) between two depth ranges (10-20m and 

20-30m) and with average similarity between the trips of 32.14% for first depth range (10-20m) and

30.56% for first depth range (10-20m) and 17.1% for the second depth range (20-30m). 

For the abundance there is a resemblance level of 30 for most of the trips where the net was at a 

depth between 10 and 20 meters except the greca trammel net from trip 9 and a resemblance level of 55 

between the trips where the net was in a similar depth range for the standard (T) trammel net and greca

majority of the trips where the net was at a depth between 10 and 20 meters except for trip nine’s 

standard trammel net (Figure 17b). A resemblance level of 45 varied, however there are two main group

(10-20m and 20-30m) and a cluster overlay. 
 

Figures 3.6.3a and 3.6.3b are the MDS plots for the abundance and biomass of combined catch 

data with depth as the factor. The stress factors are 0.18 and 0.21 for abundance and biomass, 

respectively, which is a fair goodness of fit for abundance but, a poor goodness of fit for biomass. 

ANOSIM for commercial abundance and biomass with a square root transformation gave global R 

values of 0.66 and 0.683 respectively, signifying a strong separation between the two depth ranges. 

Abundance and biomass have significance levels of 0.1% and 0.1% meaning that that with a variation in 

depth the separation is significant. This is further supported by a p-value of 0.001 and 0.001 in 

PERMANOVA. In SIMPER (Figure XVIII and Figure XIX), there is support for strong dissimilarity 

(85.09%) between two depth ranges (10-20m and 20-30m) and with average similarity between the trips 

of 31.07% for first depth range (10-20m) and 26.62% for the second depth range (20-30m) for

3.7 Two Way PERMANOVA   

 

 For abundance of all species using a two way PERMANOVA  test, depth is significant with a p-

value of  0.001 while net type is not significant with a p-value of 0.104 (Table 3.7.1). The interaction 

between these two factors is not significant with a p-value of 0.828. The factor season was significant 

with a p-value of 0.002 while net type was not significant with a p-value of 0.282  (Table 3.7.2). Again, 

the interaction between two factors (net type and season) was  not significant  (p = 0.944). The two way 

PERMANOVA  was repeated with target catch, which was significant with a p-value of 0.001, and net 

type, which was insignificant with a p-value of 0.131 (Table 3.7.3). The interaction between two factors, 

net type and target catch, was  not significant with a p-value 0.935.

3.8 Bycatch Removal Time 

 

 23 individuals were used to observe the average time it took to remove each of the six most 

abundant bycatch species (Figure 3.8.1). The species that takes the longest to time to remove from the 

net is Rhizostoma pulmo with an average time of 18 seconds (SD 12.14 s) followed  by Trachinus 

draco with an average removal time of 14 seconds (SD 5.5 s) as seen in Figure 3.4.1. The species with 

the largest standard deviation of 8.45 seconds after R. pulmo, is Cymbium olla. The last three species 

(Chelidonichthys obscurus, Scomber colias, and various Porifera species) had an average removal time 

between 9, 6.54, and 8.45 seconds respectively with standard deviations of less 6 seconds.

3.9 Net Damage Assessment  

 The entire 1.5 kilometers of net had 127 holes in total (Figure 3.9.1). 84, or 66% of the total, 

holes occurred in the greca (modified net). About 81% of the holes in the greca net occurred in the lower 

half of the net, about 60% were larger than 20 cm, and 62% of the holes were found in the greca layer. 

43, or 34% of the total, holes occurred in the standard net where approximately 88% were in the upper 

part of the net, 58% were more than 20 cm in width/diameter, and 50% were in the inner layer and other 

50% in the outer layer.

4. Discussion 

 

4.1 Commercial Catch: Greca vs Standard    

 

 In regards to the legislation ‘A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in 

European fisheries (COM, 2007)’, this modification to the trammel net resulted in a loss of earnings 

revenue, with the catches of the modified nets worth only 61.8% of those of the standard nets earnings. 

When observing commercial catch, the greca net caught 53.9% of that caught in the standard trammel net 

regarding abundance and 64.3% of that in the standard trammel net in biomass which is more important 

as it also indicates  higher similarity in revenue. The most significant decrease in commercial catch was 

seen among the sole species: Microchirus azevia (64 individuals in greca trammel net and 177 

individuals in the standard trammel net), Solea senegalensis (11 individuals in the greca versus 32 in the 

standard), and Pegusa lascaris (10 individuals in the greca and 28 individuals in the standard). When 

observing revenue, two of the three most valuable species for the standard net were two sole species: 

Microchirus azevia (€237.33) and Solea senegalensis (€192.60). Microchirus azevia that was caught in 

the greca trammel net produced a revenue 36.86% that of the standard net with €87.48, followed by the 

second target species Sepia officinalis, which was a less valuable species in the standard net in 

comparison to the soles, with €77.30. Compared to previous studies such as in Izmir Bay, the net was not 

considered successful as these studies were geared towards target catches that were pelagic species versus 

the initial target species which were demersal (soles species) for the first half of sampling. In Antalya 



38 

 

Bay, none of the commercial species are demersal; they were considered bycatch, and with teleosts as the 

commercial catch, the selvedge net was considered successful (Oluger &amp;amp; Deval 2013). However, the 

greca trammel net’s second most valuable species was Sepia officinalis which was the second target 

species for the second half of sampling and the value of the catch was nearly as much as that of the 

standard net. This year was not a good year for this cuttlefish species as waters in the Algarve were 

considered warm until the end of fall and therefore the cuttlefish season was short and unproductive. 

However, the greca trammel net did catch the European squid (Loligo vulgaris) which is a high value, 

relatively rare species.  

 

4.2 Discards: Greca vs Standard   

Greca trammel net catches were 45.3% of those of the standard trammel net in commercial 

discards abundance and 57.7% in bycatch abundance. Bycatch is a problem in terms of taking up net area 

that can be used to catch commercial species especially if a certain bycatch is being caught in relatively 

large quantities. There were three main bycatch species. Longfin gurnards (Chelidonichthys obscurus) of 

which 288 individuals were caught and the greca net caught 37.8% of what the standard net caught. This 

species is possibly attracted to the net as its diet is rich in Amphipods (Serrano et al. 2003) and 

commercial species that were discarded generally were scavenged by amphipods. Since there was less 

commercial discard biomass in the greca net, it could possibly correlate to the significant reduction in this 

bycatch species in the greca net. This is an important reduction as the longfin gurnard has many spines 

that would be entangled in the net which could cause damage to the net, possibly explaining why in the 

standard net nearly all of the holes found were in the upper part of the net, many of which were in the 

inner layer where this species was often caught in. The second bycatch species with the highest individual 

count was the Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias) with 233 individuals, of which the greca net 

caught 128.4% that of what the standard net caught. However, this species is sometimes considered a 

commercial catch and it did not pose a threat of physical damage to the net. Also, out of the six bycatch 

species that were timed, it was the species that took the least amount of time on average to be removed 

from the net. Lastly, the third bycatch species with the highest individual count was the Greater weever 

(Trachinus draco), with 202 individuals, of which the greca net caught 66.9% of what the standard net 

caught. The reduction of this species is important due to the danger it poses to the fishermen as it is 

venomous and it was the second most time consuming removal species as it took on average 14.045 

seconds, for a total of nearly an hour of removal time for this species over the course of 20 trips. 



39 

 

Additional time is required to smash the head in to prevent onboard injuries which can result in 

population reductions and as this species is the prey of Brill, or Scophthalmus rhombus (Bagge, 2004) 

which is a one of the most expensive flatfish at €13.2 per kilogram, this can possibly disrupt the fishery 

for the species.  

The discard ratio of the greca to standard net for commercial catch biomass is 0.318 and this was 

most likely due to the fact that less individuals of commercial were caught, although a decrease in 

discards is a positive step for the legislation to ban discards. The species with the highest discarded 

weight in the greca net were Balistes capriscus with 1.859 kg discarded or a loss of €8.65  and 

Microchirus azevia with 1.465 kg discarded, or a loss of €13.478. The species with the highest discarded 

weight in the standard net were Raja undulata with 5.687 kg , or a loss of €14.79, Sepia officinalis with 

5.508 kg discarded, or a loss of  €67.19, and Microchirus azevia with 3.601 kg discarded, or a loss of 

€33.10. The majority of discarding commercial species was due to scavenging and parasites. Maja 

squinado was the only species for which multiple individuals were released due to being undersized and 

considered juveniles. Myliobatis aquila was released because they are considered of little or no value and 

are highly vulnerable (Baeta et al., 2010).  A blue shark (Prionace glauca), which is often caught in 

driftnets, was also released as it was considered bycatch and under protection due to its high vulnerability  

(Cavanagh and Gibson, 2007). With dolphins and seagulls trailing the boat, many of the species that 

came onboard alive, were predated on upon entering the water. The greca trammel net caught 80.4% of 

that in the standard net in bycatch biomass. The most significant different was in C. obscurus in which 

the greca net discarded 12.483 kg and the standard trammel net discarded 33.253 kg. The other two main 

bycatch species did not have a significant difference in biomass.  

Theoretically, had the net been only used during cuttlefish season and the three main sole species  

were not targeted, the greca trammel net caught nearly the same amount with a ratio of 0.844 that of the 

standard net. The Atlantic chub mackerel, Scomber colias, although sold commonly in the market, was 

considered a bycatch species by the fishermen. Had the fishermen who use trammel nets sold the 

mackerel species, the ratio of discard abundance in the greca net would drop to 0.463 that of the standard 

net while increasing the commercial abundance in the greca trammel net from 0.539 to 0.698 that of the 

standard trammel net. Therefore, changing the net from standard net used in during the métier of sole 

species to the greca trammel net during cuttlefish season can possibly result in similar production in 

earnings  and even more so if the fishermen using the net would consider selling Atlantic chub mackerel 

while reducing bycatch significantly.  



40 

 

4.3 Damage in the Net   

Conducting net damage assessment gave some insight on the possibility as to why there was a 

significant reduction in sole species caught in the greca trammel net. There were twice as many holes in 

the greca modified net with the majority in the greca layer and about 60% of the holes had a width or 

diameter larger than 20 centimeters. The greatest difference among the three factors in the standard 

trammel net was placement in the net. Approximately 88% of the holes found in the standard net were in 

the upper half of the net, most likely due to teleost species occurring in higher numbers. In a previous 

study comparing standard trammel net to a modified trammel net, damage was also assessed but, only 

whether it was in the upper or lower halves of the inner net and disregarding size (Gökçe et al., 2016) 

while another study simply accounted for the size of the hole in the net but not where in the net the hole 

occurred (Maccarrone et al. 2014) which can result in missing information as to which commercial and 

bycatch species are being affected through modifications. The greca trammel net holes were most likely 

due to two reasons: the material was not strong enough against demersal species with spikes or the 

fishermen were less careful as they suspected they would not use the greca net after sampling was 

finished. If the standard net were to make more money but, have more holes which would require fixing 

that is taken away from earnings  then the assessment could be a necessary in convincing fishermen to 

change nets. The cost of the greca trammel net (material and labour) was 105 euros per net  while that of  

the standard trammel net was only 58 euros per net. Since there were twice as many holes in the greca 

net, twice as expensive as the standard net to construct, and the greca net produced less earnings than the 

standard trammel net,  there was no benefit to calculating the loss in earnings for fixing the net.  

 

4.4 Removing Bycatch: Time matters   

Regarding the removal of different species from the nets, it was not possible to time all the 

removals as the videos were either not positioned in a way that would permit viewing of the species being 

removed from the net, not positioned on the fisherman working on a certain species (as it was noticed that 

each fishermen had a “specialty” and were given certain species every time), the GoPro moved during the 

trip, the battery died and therefore cut out. Therefore, there was a possibility of timing of 23 individuals 

for each of the six bycatch species. As previously stated, bycatch removal can be laborious and dangerous 

with no positive return, thus the reduction of these species would reduce overall time spent on species 

that are not earnings able. Rhizostoma pulmo, or the barrel jellyfish, was the most dangerous species 

being caught in the net as even pieces of the jellyfish left severe stings and was the most time consuming 



41 

 

in releasing with an average time of 18.14 seconds. The main problem faced was having to stop hauling 

the net completely to release the jellyfish while it was still in the water. The second most time consuming 

species was Trachinus draco, as previously stated, due to its’ dangerous venom and spines. The third 

most time consuming was Cymbium olla with an average time of 12.45 seconds, though it poses no threat 

the species must be ripped out of its’ shell which can severally damage the animal directly while 

indirectly causing mortality as it is no longer protected and open to predation. The last three species 

Chelidonichthys obscurus (had their spines laid down), Scomber colias (generally small and easily 

removed), and Porifera spp (ripped apart) were removed at an average time between six and nine 

seconds. While the times seem insignificant when looked at in seconds, some of the species took nearly 

an hour over the course of only 20 trips to remove individuals and that time accumulates if fishermen are 

out on the water five days a week every week of the year.  Furthermore, it is important to note that 

commercial trammel netters fish many kms of nets in a single set (more than 10km for the larger 

vessels), which means that considerable amounts of time and manpower are required to remove species 

such as the weeverfish from the nets if we extrapolate the estimates obtained in this study for only 1.5 

km of trammel nets.      

 

4.5 Factors influencing catch  

 Using PRIMER and PERMANOVA +, four factors were used to analyse the results and these 

were: net type (greca trammel net versus standard trammel net), seasonality (fall versus winter), target 

catch (sole species versus cuttlefish), and depth ranges (10-20 m versus 20-30 m). The reason for métier 

being separated into target catch and season was because there were 15 trips in fall while in winter there 

were only five trips conducted and sole species were targeted the first 10 trips while cuttlefish were 

targeted in the second half of the trips. Therefore season and target species did not coincide. 

It is observed in the MDS plots that the strength of separation is more apparent in commercial 

catch when target species are the factor which is confirmed by ANOSIM and SIMPER which gave 

exceptionally high dissimilarities for both abundance and biomass. The results were similar for 

commercial catch when depth was a factor and when overlaying clusters on the MDS plot, there was a 

higher resemblance over the standard trammel nets. Seasonality as a factor for commercial catch 

produced the weakest separation among the two seasons for both abundance and biomass, although 

biomass had a slightly higher dissimilarity level.     



42 

 

For discard species, the factor target catch had the least effect with moderate separation strength 

for abundance and a weak separation strength for biomass with the weakest dissimilarity for both biomass 

and abundance across all three factors. The strongest separation strength was in abundance when the 

factor was depth. Our three main bycatch species vary in depth, S.colias can be found from 0 to 300 

meters in depth (Vasconcelo et al. 2011), C. obscurus has a range of 0 to 170 meters according to 

Fishbase, and T. draco has a depth range of 0 to 200 meters (IUNC). Seasonality was important when 

observing what influences catch composition and discards in the Sothern Black Sea, Turkey, where it was 

observed that there was a significant difference in discard species between summer and spring with a 

significant difference in discard rates when the depth was greater than 30 meter and the highest discards 

rates with depth over 16 meter (Kalayci 2014). This is possibly the reason why discard rates were so high 

since 12 out of the 20 trips were in less than 16 meter depth. This is similar for the discard species when 

season was a factor. For both abundance and biomass the strength of separation was moderate with 

similar dissimilarity levels.  

Overall, the combined species (commercial, commercial discards, and bycatch) displayed clusters 

formed among the trips. Examples included modified (M) and standard (T) trammel nets for trips 2,7, and 

8 with the strongest similarities across biomass. Interestingly, for trip 7 the two net types were in the 

water the longest, approximately 47 hours due to unexpected bad weather the day it was supposed to be 

hauled in; therefore time did not affect the similarity between the net types. The combined data displayed 

a high dissimilarity and strong separation when target catch and depth were factors with biomass data 

having slightly higher dissimilarity. However, similar to commercial catch, seasonality as a factor 

resulted in moderate separation strength in abundance and weak separation in biomass and the weakest 

dissimilarity for both. Two groups were formed among the trips when overlaying the cluster for the data 

based on their depth ranges for both abundance and biomass, although the resemblance level was slightly 

higher regarding the abundance data. In general, a higher resemblance level meant greca trammel nets to 

be in their own group individually. Two-way PERMANOVA  for combined catch data, for both biomass 

and abundance, was conducted comparing net type against depth, seasonality, and target catch. The 

results for abundance was that net type had a p-value 0.828, 0.994, and 0.935 respectively meaning that 

the interaction is not significant. For biomass the p-values were 0.386, 0.96, and 0.935 respectively also 

indicating that the interaction is not significant.  

With a discard ban already becoming active across certain parts of Europe, the question is raised 

if this will in fact be positive for both the economy and the environment. According to legislating the ban 



43 

 

would include all finfish and crustaceans. There are certain discards of commercial catch that are due to 

the species’ being a juvenile or females are carrying eggs, which prevents the individual from being sold 

on the market. Certain species’ juveniles and females can be free from any negative impact from 

interacting with the net. This being said, will the ban increase mortality of these individuals as they are 

brought into port or will there be a definition for which live discards are to be returned to the water and 

simply noted? The document claims that exception would be made if the species is known to have a high 

percentange in long-term survival. In order to establish this, researchers must conduct survivability tests 

and upon agreeing on the support of the results, the information must be given to all the fishermen 

involved in the specific fishery to avoid an increase in mortality of pre-spawn individuals.  

 

5. Conclusions  

The results suggest that the greca modification, or selvedge net, did not reduce bycatch in the 

trammel net in terms of biomass but, did reduce bycatch in terms of abundance There was, however, a 

significant difference between the greca trammel net and standard trammel net among commercial 

discard biomass which meant earnings revenue was lost in the modified net. Overall, the standard 

trammel produced nearly twice as much revenue as the modified net due to the significant difference in 

catches of sole species, especially Microchirus azevia, which is one the most expensive sole species that 

was caught. Although the removals of the most abundant and dangerous bycatch species were timed and 

there was a clear indication of the time fishermen wasted on removing them, to fully assess bycatch 

disrupting the valuable time that could be used for removal of commercial catch, the method must be 

expanded. In order to focus on timing bycatch species, researchers will have to either add hands on deck 

to do the timing while on board or consider adding more cameras to capture every fisherman working. It 

is equally vital to observe net damage assessment including monetary loss as this can play as a factor in 

convincing fishermen to change nets. It appears that depth had the most effect across the different data 

sets and therefore should be further studied with more depth ranges to see at what depth bycatch is more 

abundant in order to avoid those depths to reduce bycatch. Since this project was conducted on a 

commercial fishing boat and there was no language barrier between the fishermen and the researchers, it 

enabled a positive interaction in order to receive some perspective as well as observing a willingness to 

change. In conclusion, changing gear throughout the year per métier can be proven to be most effective in 

terms of economy and the environment. Further research must be conducted in this area with trammel net 

modifications.
