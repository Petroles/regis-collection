RESUMO 

Recuperação das propriedades hidrícas do solo após da restauração florestal na Mata 
Atlântica 

O conhecimento sobre as florestas em processo de restauração florestal ao redor do mundo está cada 
vez mais em evidência, devido principalmente à sua importância nas funções ecossistêmicas relacionadas à água, 
tais como a promoção da infiltração. Contudo, apesar de existirem muitos estudos sobre áreas em restauração, 
abordando sua biodiversidade e algumas funções ecossistêmicas, o papel do solo nessas florestas em restauração 
permanece ainda pouco conhecido, por exemplo, poucos trabalhos têm analisado o efeito sobre o solo das 
diferentes estratégias de restauração (e.g., plantio de espécies nativas e regeneração natural). Nesse contexto, o 
objetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar e obter uma melhor compreensão dos efeitos de diferentes metodologias de 
restauração florestal na recuperação das propriedades físicas e hídricas do solo, mais especificamente na 
recuperação da infiltração de água no solo. Na primeira parte desse estudo (Capítulo 2) foi realizada uma revisão 
sistemática da literatura científica, reportando e discutindo os resultados de trabalhos sobre infiltração de água 
no solo em florestas em processo de restauração nos Trópicos, por meio do plantio de árvores. Os resultados 
desses trabalhos mostraram que houve um aumento da infiltração após o plantio de árvores; também observamos 
que a recuperação da infiltração foi mais rápida quando a agricultura era o uso anterior do solo; que solos mais 
argilosos (&gt;30% argila) tenderam a exibir maiores aumentos na infiltração após plantio de árvores; e que as 
florestas em restauração com 10 ou mais anos evidenciaram valores de infiltração mais similares com as condições 
pré-distúrbio do solo (e.g., floresta natural de referência). Os dois capítulos restantes do trabalho (Capítulos 3 e 
4) foram realizadas em uma área em processo de restauração florestal, com plantio de espécies nativas e elevada 
diversidade, no municipio de Campinas, São Paulo, Brasil. No Capítulo 3 foi investigado o efeito da restauração 
florestal na condutividade hidráulica do solo (Ks), verificando a recuperação da Ks até as condições pré-distúrbio. 
A Ks foi amostrada no campo em três tipos de uso do solo: (i) pastagem; (ii) área em restauração com 9 anos de 
idade; e (iii) florestal natural remanescente. Os resultados desse capítulo mostraram que a recuperação 
da Ks diferiu entre as áreas em processo de restauração; e que os atributos do solo e a recuperação da Ks foram 
influenciados pela intensidade e tempo de uso do solo anterior à restauração florestal. No Capítulo 4 foi avaliado 
o efeito do histórico de uso do solo na recuperação da Ks, dos atributos do solo e da vegetação, comparando as 
estratégias de restauração ativa vs. passiva (e.g., restauração assistida). Nesses capítulos concluímos que as ações 
de restauração florestal podem melhorar as propriedades físicas e hídricas do solo, porém, a recuperação de 
valores próximos aos valores de referência tem grande dificuldade, especialmente quando a área em restauração 
teve um histórico de uso intenso do solo. É fundamental entender como ocorre a recuperação do solo nas áreas 
em processo de restauração ecológica em diferentes tipos de climas, florestas e solos. Assim, fica claro a 
necessidade de pesquisas de longo prazo que foquem no movimento da água no perfil do solo, visando entender 
como a restauração florestal recupera o processo de infiltração da água no solo, inclusive na escala de paisagem 
(e.g., bacia hidrográfica).

ABSTRACT  

Recovery of soil hydraulic properties after forest restoration in the Atlantic Forest 
 
Knowledge about forests undergoing restoration across the world is becoming increasingly essential 

due to the benefits of restoring forest for ecosystem functions related to water, such as water infiltration. 
Although there is a growing literature regarding the biodiversity and some ecosystem functions in forest 
undergoing restoration, soil responses in these forests remain virtually unknown. Moreover, few works have 
analyzed the effects on soil of different restoration approaches (e.g., planting of native species and natural 
regeneration). In this context, the main objective of this work was to evaluate and gain a better understanding of 
the effects of different forest restoration methodologies on the recovery of soil physical and hydraulic properties, 
more specifically on water infiltration. In the first part of this study (Chapter 2) was conducted a systematic 
review of scientific literature, reporting and discussing the infiltration measures in tropical forests undergoing 
restoration by tree planting. The results of this review indicated that infiltration was likely to increase after tree 
planting; that infiltration recovery was faster when agriculture was the prior land use; that clayey soils (&gt;30% 
clay) tended to exhibit greater increases in infiltration after tree planting; and that restored forests after 10 years 
evidenced more similar infiltration values with the pre-disturbance soil conditions (e.g., natural reference forest). 
The following two parts of the thesis (Chapter 3 and 4) were based on a restoration program using a high-diversity 
mix of native plantings in the county of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. In the Chapter 3 was investigated the effect 
of forest restoration on saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), verifying the Ks recovery to the pre-disturbance 
soil conditions. We sampled field Ks under three land-cover types: (i) a pasture; (ii) a restored forest of 9 years of 
age; and (iii) a remnant forest patch. Our results showed that Ks recovery differ markedly among the forests 
undergoing restoration; and that soil attributes and Ks recovery are influenced by the duration and intensity of 
land use prior to forest restoration. In the Chapter 4 we assessed the effects of land use history on the recovery 
of Ks, soil and vegetation attributes, comparing active vs. passive restoration (e.g., assisted restoration). In these 
chapters we conclude that forest restoration actions may improve soil physical and hydraulic properties, but in 
some cases a complete recovery to reference levels can be difficult, especially when land use was more intense 
prior to forest restoration actions. It is very important to understand soil recovery in forests undergoing 
restoration on different climate, forest and soil types. Thereby, in future research long-term studies are essential, 
which should focus in the water movement through the soil profile and aiming to understand how the forest 
restoration can recover the infiltration process, also including landscape scale (e.g., watershed).

1. INTRODUCTION 

Recent forest restoration initiatives are playing a fundamental role in forest cover expansion across 

the planet (Chazdon, 2008; Keenan et al. 2015), through ambitious international (e.g., Bonne Challenge; 

New York Declaration on Forests and Goal 15 in U.N. Sustainable Development Goals), regional (e.g., 20 

x 20 and AFR100) and national initiatives (Chazdon et al. 2017). In Brazil, the Pact for the Restoration of 

the Atlantic Forest has emerged to restore 15 million hectares of forest by 2050 (Rodrigues et al. 2009) and 

the National Plan for the Restoration of the Native vegetation has a goal of restoring 12 million hectares in 

the next 20 years. These restoration efforts are fundamental for human well-being, especially when 

considering the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem functions (Sabogal et al. 2015; Aronson et al. 2017). 

In this context, the soils have critical relevance, providing ecosystem services through their functions 

(Mendes et al. 2018). Seven ecosystem functions have been highlighted for which soils are critical (Keesstra 

et al. 2016): (i) biomass production; (ii) storing, filtering and transforming nutrients, substances and water; 

(iii) biodiversity pool, such as habitats, species and genes; (iv) physical and cultural environment for humans 

and human activities; (v) source of raw material; (vi) acting as carbon pool; (vii) archive of geological and 

archaeological heritage. Additionally, since restoration ecology emerged, the importance of soil has been 

increasingly recognized as fundamental to reach the goals of forest restoration programs (Heneghan et al. 

2008). Nevertheless, in forest undergoing restoration around the world, most studies have focused on 

establishing aboveground plant communities, but belowground environment (e.g., soil physical and 

hydraulic properties), and aboveground-belowground linkages have been neglected. For that reason, some 

authors stated that forest restoration has been “phytocentric” (Kardol &amp;amp; Wardle, 2010; Ohsowski et al. 

2012). This situation is evident in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where a recent literature review emphasizes 

that the monitoring in most of the restoration projects are not considering any soil indicator (59% of 152 

published works), and they are not including information about reference sites (e.g., old-growth forest and 

degraded lands) (Mendes et al. 2018). The noticeable soil data gaps are a great challenge to forest restoration 

practice and a test to soil ecology knowledge, which according with (Bradshaw, 1987) statement, it could 

provide an “acid test” (Heneghan et al. 2008).  

Considering the aforementioned information, the effects of restoration efforts on soil still requires 

a better understanding. In particular, water infiltration, which is considered as a key hydrological process 

that influences a large number of essential ecosystem processes, such as groundwater recharge, soil erosion 

and surface runoff (Zimmermann et al. 2006; Neary et al. 2009), as well as growth and plant productivity 

(Thompson et al. 2010), have been poorly explored in forest restoration contexts. Water infiltration is 

defined as the process of water entry into the soil surface (Brutsaert, 2005). In this way, during rainfall events 

the water can move through the soil profile both vertically and horizontally by the combined effect of gravity 

and capillary, also depending on the soil type and slope of the terrain (Elsenbeer, 2001). It is important to 

note that water infiltration is a complex process which depends on a large number of factors, thus, a vast 

literature has been produced in the last century to understand the physics and dynamics of this process 



12 
 

(Assouline, 2013). Since early work of Darcy (1856), it is possible to find in scientific literature several 

approaches developing mathematical and numerical tools to quantitatively describe the infiltration process 

(e.g., Buckingham, 1907; Richards, 1931; Philip, 1957 among other studies).  

A crucial parameter to characterize water infiltration is the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), 

which determines how much water will move through the soil under saturated conditions (Elsenbeer, 2001; 

Hassler et al. 2011). Although Ks is reported to have the greatest variability among soil physical and hydraulic 

properties (Deb, 2012), it is also considered a key indicator to evaluate the effects of land use change on soil 

hydrology (Zimmermann et al. 2006; Zimmermann &amp;amp; Elsenbeer, 2008). For instance, removal of native 

forest cover followed by settlement of different land uses (e.g., agriculture and pastures) results into soils 

with low values of Ks, which could be associated with increasing erosion, surface runoff and floods (Ziegler 

et al. 2004; Nyberg et al. 2012). On the contrary, when the land use change occurs from degraded soils to 

forested land, using different restoration approaches (e.g., active and passive restoration), the Ks may 

eventually reach the high values found in pre-disturbance soil conditions. But this recovery may take decades 

(Bonell et al. 2010; Ghimire et al. 2014) and can be extremely difficult in some cases (Filoso et al. 2017). 

While most studies measuring soil physical and hydraulic properties in forest undergoing restoration have 

focused in areas under natural regeneration, actively restored forests and comparisons between restoration 

approaches have rarely been considered (Ghimire et al. 2014; Crouzeilles et al. 2017). 

Currently, it is clear that there are several knowledge gaps for soil recovery process after forest 

restoration, and soil is still regarded as a “black box” by restoration practitioners (Heneghan et al. 2008). To 

bridge these gaps and continue opening the “black box”, our study aims to evaluate and gain a better 

understanding of the effects of different forest restoration methods on the recovery of soil physical and 

hydraulic properties, more specifically on water infiltration. Having that in mind, our work is based on a 

forest restoration program in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, planed and implemented by the Forest Ecology 

and Restoration Laboratory (LERF) from “Escola de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz” (ESALQ), University 

of São Paulo, in partnership with the Fazenda Guariroba, located in the county of Campinas, São Paulo 

State, Southeast Brazil. This program started in 2007 over an area of 300 hectares, testing different 

restoration approaches (e.g., active and passive restoration). Before restoration actions the area was formerly 

covered mainly by low-yielding pastures and presents slope percentages greater than 20%. In particular, tree 

plantings were implemented as mixed plantation with high-diversity-mix of seedlings (85 regional native 

species), aiming to provide economical insurance for landowners and to ensure successional processes. For 

detailed information’s of this restoration model see Preiskorn et al. (2009). Also, it is important to highlight 

that active restoration was implemented on highly degraded soil, with an intense land use history and poor 

potential for autogenic restoration, and passive restoration was promoted on a slightly degraded soil, with a 

previous second-growth forest and high potential for autogenic restoration (Rodrigues et al. 2011). 

 Given the previous context, this thesis consists of five chapters. This first chapter is an overall 

introduction, containing the contextualization of the topic, main objectives, questions and hypotheses that 

have been addressed during the research. The second chapter presents a systematic review of scientific 

literature reporting and discussing infiltration measures in tropical forests undergoing restoration by tree 



13 
 

 
 

planting. In this chapter we also analyzed the potential effect of restoration age and soil texture on 

infiltration responses after tree planting. The third chapter investigates the Ks recovery by field estimation 

under three land covers, namely pasture, 9-year-old undergoing restoration forest, and remnant forest. We 

hypothesized that forest restoration can recover surface Ks values to the pre-disturbance soil conditions, 

also the following questions were addressed: (1) Does forest restoration recover top-soil Ks values that 

characterize the remnant forest? and; (2) Are the measured soil attributes between land covers similar? The 

fourth chapter compares the Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties recovery between soils under active 

vs. passive restoration approach. This chapter evaluates whether differences in land use history led to 

differences in soil and vegetation attributes. Specifically, we hypothesized that Ks would vary with intensity 

of land use history, considering that the active restoration site had a more intensive land use history, we 

expected that Ks recovery and vegetation attributes will be higher in the passive restoration. Finally, the fifth 

chapter presents a summary of the main results of this study, providing the main conclusions and 

recommendations for future researches.

2. TREE PLANTING EFFECTS ON INFILTRATION CAPACITY IN THE TROPICS: A 

SYSTEMATIC AND CRITICAL REVIEW 

This manuscript was submitted in the journal Forest Ecology and Management.  

Abstract 

Infiltration of rainfall is one of the most important hydrological processes with 
important influence on soil erosion, runoff, soil moisture content and groundwater recharge 
in ecosystems. This is particularly important in forest restoration contexts, considering the 
increasing number of restoration initiatives around the world promoting tree planting and 
consequently increasing forest cover. Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of the effects 
of tree planting on infiltration and the factors controlling these effects is lacking. Here, we 
conducted a systematic review of scientific literature reporting infiltration measures in restored 
forests in the tropics. We found eleven studies representing 67 data comparisons in eight 
countries. Overall results indicate that infiltration is likely to increase after tree planting in 
forest restoration. Infiltration recovered quickly when agriculture was the prior land use, 
whereas recovery was slower when trees were planted into pastures and bare soils. There was 
a trend in restored forests with soils having &gt;30% clay to exhibit greater increases in 
infiltration, contrasting with the smaller increases for sandy soils (&lt;30% clay). Restored forests 
after 10 years evidenced similar infiltration values than the pre-disturbance soil conditions. 
Our findings emphasize the need to monitor water infiltration in restored forests under 
different soil conditions and over time. Finally, we identified six knowledge gaps requiring 
future research efforts, that aim to improve our understanding of when and why forest 
restoration may promote recovery of infiltration in tropical soils. 

Keywords: Agriculture; Forest; Forest restoration; Pasture; Saturated hydraulic conductivity 

 

2.1. Introduction  

Recent global assessments have shown that forest cover is expanding through forest restoration 

efforts, resulting in an increase of forest cover at rates of 2.5 million ha yr-1 around the world from 2010 to 

2015 (FAO, 2015; Keenan et al., 2015). This increase is usually associated with positive effects on many 

ecosystem functions that are essential to sustain ecosystem services for human wellbeing such as infiltration 

of rainwater (Chazdon, 2008; Filoso et al., 2017). Infiltration is a key hydrological process in ecosystems to 

maintain productive soil-water-plant interactions but also with strong effects on soil erosion, runoff, soil 

moisture content and groundwater recharge (Ziegler et al., 2004; Gageler et al., 2014).  

There have been limited efforts to summarize the effects of forest restoration on infiltration in 

the tropics. The early reviews by Bruijnzeel (2004) and Scott et al. (2005) studied to some extent the impacts 

of forest cover expansion on infiltration. Subsequently, Ilstedt et al. (2007) provided a meta-analysis of the 

increase in infiltration after tree planting in formerly agricultural fields. A more recent review by Filoso et 

al. (2017) focusing in the impacts of forest restoration on water yields, showed that infiltration was a positive 



18 
 

outcome after restoration activities. However, infiltration is a complex soil attribute with high variability in 

both space and time (Deb and Shukla, 2012), and it is affected by a number of factors, such as soil texture 

and structure, past land use, soil type and vegetation, among others (Zimmermann et al., 2006; Leite et al., 

2017). Indeed, the influence of these factors on the recovery of infiltration after tree planting is poorly 

understood and has been neglected by previous reviews (Sun et al., 2018). 

Here, we conducted a systematic review of scientific literature with the primary objective of 

gathering, synthesizing and discussing the available information on the recovery of infiltration in tropical 

forests restored by tree planting in sites under different prior land uses. We also analyzed the potential effect 

of restoration age and soil texture on infiltration responses after tree planting. 

 

2.2. Material and methods 

2.2.1. Literature Searching 

A systematic literature search was made in December 2017, using ISI Web of Science and SciELO, 

without any restriction on publication year and including peer-reviewed articles published in English, 

Spanish or Portuguese. We used the following combination of terms: (“forest restoration” or “afforestation” 

or “reforestation” or “forestation”) and (“water conductivity” or “infiltrat*” or “hydraulic conductivity” or 

“soil properties”). These keyword terms found 502 hits. To be included in the analysis, studies had to meet 

the following inclusion criteria; (1) focus on forest restoration actions using trees (e.g., not shrublands or 

arid ecosystems); (2) report field measurements on infiltration rate or saturated hydraulic conductivity in the 

surface soil (0-10 cm); (3) compare infiltration in the restored forest with either degraded or reference 

conditions; (4) reported mean values, standard deviations and sample size; (5) study site located in the 

tropical region, between 23.5º N and 23.5º S, and thus excluding temperate and boreal forests. 

We only found eight papers that met all criteria. Thus, as suggested by Ilsted et al. (2007) and to 

increase the number of observations in the database, we included the following three subtropical studies: 

Gilmour et al. (1987), Gageler et al. (2014) and Ghimire et al. (2014), which are slightly outside the tropical 

region but met all other criteria.  

2.2.2. Data Extraction and Database Building 

For each study, we extracted the country, mean annual precipitation, latitude and longitude where 

the infiltration measurements took place. Response variables that could influence infiltration were compiled, 

such as soil type, soil texture, method of measurement (e.g., disc permeameter, minidisk infiltrometer, 

simple-ring or double-ring), planting type (e.g., monoculture or diverse), restoration age (as the number of 

years since forest planting was established), and land use prior to tree planting (e.g., agriculture, bare soil, 

pasture or reference forest). Soil type was classified according to the USDA classification system, and 

because of the important role that soil texture can have on infiltration, soils was grouped in two contrasted 



19 
 

 
 

groups based on clay content: less than 30 percent clay (&lt;30% clay, hereafter “sandy soils”) and greater than 

30 percent clay (&gt;30% clay, hereafter “clayey soils”) (Basche and DeLonge, 2017). Furthermore, the values 

of infiltration rate or saturated hydraulic conductivity in the surface soil were recorded and standardized in 

mm.h-1. Since several studies suggest that infiltration recovery might take more than one decade after tree 

planting (Zimmermann and Elsenbeer, 2008; Bonell et al., 2010), a 10-year threshold was used to detect if 

water infiltration could recover to pre-disturbance levels a decade after forest planting. Therefore, 

restoration age was classified in two main groups, namely “older restored forests” (&gt;10 years) and “younger 

restored forests” (&lt;10 years). 

Previous agricultural lands were areas that have been heavily transformed for agricultural activities, 

included slash-and-burn agriculture and different croplands (e.g., annual crops). Bare soil included degraded 

areas where the topsoil was removed and have been exposed since the disturbance without vegetation cover. 

Pastures were areas that were highly disturbed by grazing livestock, where the vegetation cover is dominated 

by grass and herb species. Reference forests were naturally conserved or minimally disturbed areas that 

never have been totally cleared. These forests contain large trees, understory vegetation and a litter layer 

that covers the soil surface.  

2.2.3. Data Analysis 

The log response ratio (LRR) was used to quantify the effects of tree planting on infiltration 

relative to a control. The LRR was calculated using the following equation (Hedges et al., 1999): 

LRR =  ln
Xrest

Xref
     (1) 

Where Xrest is the infiltration value in the restored forest, and Xref is the infiltration value in the 

land use prior to tree planting or in the control. The mean effects with 95% confidence intervals were 

calculated for each land use prior to tree planting. Effect size estimates were considered significantly 

different from zero if their 95% confidence intervals did not cross zero (Benayas et al., 2009). In order to 

facilitate the interpretation the LRR were back transformed and converted to percentages (Basche and 

DeLonge, 2017) in figures, as: 

Percent change =  [Exp(LRR) ? 1] ? 100    (2) 

In addition, mean effects of land use prior to tree planting was analyzed according to soil clay 

content and years since forest planting was initiated. However, given the limited amount of data for bare 

soil (four comparisons from one study), this land use was not considered in the analysis. Also, for agricultural 

land uses (clayey soils and &gt;10 years after tree planting), the small number of studies did not allow a suitable 

comparison.

2.3. Results  

2.3.1. Infiltration Recovery after Tree Planting under Different Prior Land Uses 

Our review included eleven studies, yielding 67 comparisons (Appendix A), which were 

distributed across eight countries. Five studies were conducted in Asia, followed by South America, Africa 

and Oceania, each one with two studies. In those studies, annual rainfall ranged from 730 to 5,610 mm. The 

average infiltration values in restored forest was 434 mm.h-1, varying from 11 to 2,592 mm.h-1. The most 

studied soil types were the young soils Inceptisols, with four studies, followed by the highly weathered 

Oxisols and Ultisols, with three and two studies respectively. Additionally, two studies were conducted on 

fertile soils (Alfisols), one study on a volcanic soil (Andisol) and one study on a soil with low permeability 

(Vertisols). Most studies (75%) planted monocultures whereas a small number (25%) planted diverse tree 

arrangements. Monocultures commonly involved Pinus sp. species and Tectona grandis. Conversely, diverse 

plantings involved mixes of two (Perkins et al., 2012), five (Gageler et al., 2014), and more than 120 species 

(Zwartendijk et al., 2017). Field methods to determine infiltration were predominantly disc permeameters 

and double-ring infiltrometers, also, single-ring infiltrometers were used in two studies and a mini disk 

infiltrometer in one study (Figure 1).

of comparisons in each category are indicated in parentheses. 

 

Most studies (91%) reported an increase in infiltration after tree planting, and only one study 

reported lower infiltration in restored forest when compared to pasture sites (Ghimire et al., 2014). Changes 

in infiltration after tree planting ranged widely and varied depending on prior land use (Figure 2). Overall 

results showed that infiltration values in the restored forests were 39% lower than in reference forests, but, 

higher than in agricultural sites (291%), pastures (182%) and bare soil (57%).

types. Numbers in parentheses indicate the sample size followed by the numbers of studies. The percent change is significantly 
different from zero (vertical dashed line) if the 95% confidence interval does not overlap with it. 

 

2.3.2. Effect of Soil Texture and Restoration Age on Infiltration after Tree Planting 

under Different Prior Land Uses 

Results showed a trend for soils with higher clay content to exhibit higher infiltration (Figure 3). 

When compared with the reference forest, the restored forests had significant lower infiltration values in 

sandy soils (-66%), but not significant difference in clayey soils (mean percent of -24%). A similar situation 

was found when comparing restored forest and pastures, where clayey soils presented significant higher 

infiltration (302%) than sandy soils (90%). Additionally, in the former agricultural sites, tree planting in 

sandy soils showed a positive trend to improve infiltration (305%).

clayey soils in agricultural sites are not shown due to no available data. Numbers in parentheses indicate the sample size 
followed by the numbers of studies. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The percent change is significantly different 

from zero (vertical dashed line) if the 95% confidence interval does not overlap with it.  



22 
 

Mean restoration age was 12 years, ranging from three to 36 years. In general, older restored 

forests showed higher infiltration values than younger restored forests, indicating a clear effect of restoration 

age on infiltration recovery. When compared with the reference forest, infiltration levels as determined by 

the LRR were not significantly different in older and younger restored forests, with mean infiltration 32% 

and 63% percent less than the reference forest respectively (Figure 4). A similar relationship was observed 

in the comparison of restored forests versus pastures, where the mean percent increase in infiltration was 

228% in the older restored forests and 82% in the younger restored forests. In the case of the comparison 

between younger restored forests and agriculture the mean percent increase in infiltration was 330%.

percent change is significantly different from zero (vertical dashed line) if the 95% confidence interval does not overlap with 

it.  

 

2.4. Discussion 

2.4.1. Infiltration Recovery after Tree Planting under Different Prior Land Uses 

Our systematic review shows that tree planting during forest restoration has positive effects on 

infiltration in the tropics. This result is consistent with several meta-analyses in a wide range of ecosystem 

types analyzing other hydrological issues (Ilstedt et al., 2007; Filoso et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018). However, 

these finding should be interpreted with caution because most of the studies examined in our systematic 

review were conducted in planted monocultures with little information for diverse planting. Furthermore, 

in our systematic review only Ghimire et al. (2014) reported a restored forest presenting similar infiltration 

values than pasture sites. In this case, the restored forest was 25-year-old and used Pinus species (mainly P. 

roxburghii and P. patula) in Nepal, moreover, tree planting did not improve infiltration due to removal of 

litter, grazing and fuelwood harvesting that decreased the inputs of organic matter in the restored forest. 



23 
 

 
 

Thus, infiltration recovery after tree planting is affected by factors such as; soil structure, the increase of 

pore connectivity, root turnover, inputs of organic matter and growth of vegetation (Godsey and Elsenbeer, 

2002; Ziegler et al., 2004).  

Our results are in line with previous studies showing that infiltration recovery is strongly 

dependent on the prior land use before tree planting (Ziegler et al., 2004; Zimmermann et al., 2006; Hassler 

et al., 2011; Zwartendijk et al., 2017; Lozano-Baez et al., 2018). For example, when agriculture was the prior 

land use a higher degree of infiltration recovery was observed in restored forests. Similarly, Ilstedt et al. 

(2007) found that conversion from agriculture to restored forest in the tropics increased infiltration 

approximately three-fold. In contrast, trees planted into bare soil and pasture site produced lower infiltration 

recovery. In the case of conversion from bare soil to restored forest, the interpretation of results is limited 

to one study with four observations, thus, our focus will be to compare infiltration responses with agriculture 

and pasture as prior land uses. One possible explanation in the marked differences between agriculture and 

pastures is the increased soil compaction expected due to grazing animal traffic, where the pressure exerted 

by the animals can be higher than the pressure exerted by farm machinery (Silva et al., 2003). Furthermore, 

high soil compaction levels have been associated with a reduction in infiltration in several studies (Mart??nez 

and Zinck, 2004; Hamza and Anderson, 2005). 

In all cases infiltration after tree planting was not fully recovered to reference forest levels. This 

result could be associated with the preservation of natural soil conditions in reference forests, such as better 

soil structure, higher organic matter, higher macroporosity, greater soil faunal activity, higher plant diversity 

and more complex root systems that benefit the infiltration process (Bruijnzeel, 2004; Leite et al., 2017). 

The increase of infiltration after tree planting could be related to plant species and individual tree effects. A 

recent experiment on natural savannas in West Africa (Ilstedt et al. 2016) found four-fold higher infiltrability 

under trees than open areas, suggesting that an intermediate tree cover could maximize groundwater 

recharge and infiltration. In this sense, tree densities and many plant characteristics such as; root 

architecture, shade and litter could influence infiltration. However, our review found a lack of studies dealing 

with species and tree effects on infiltration in restored forests. There are many studies in natural ecosystems 

investigating soil-water dynamics (Oliveira et al., 2005; Cooper et al., 2012; Oliveira et al., 2014; Zenero et 

al., 2016). This knowledge will be crucial to apply in forest restoration. It is equally important to realize the 

soil impacts that forest restoration could be having during tree planting. For example, if the trees are planted 

by hand or shovel the disturbance is minor, but if tree planting with bulldozer or tractor is used then there 

is much more disturbance and compaction, affecting the water infiltration negatively (Löf et al., 2012). 

2.4.2. Effect of Soil Texture and Restoration Age on Infiltration after Tree Planting 

under Different Prior Land Uses 

Results from the available studies indicated a clear effect of soil texture on infiltration capacity, 

showing differences in infiltration recovery between sandy and clayey soils. In the first case, sandy soils tend 



24 
 

to have a low water retention capacity and a high water infiltration (Oades, 1993; Regelink et al., 2015). The 

aggregating forces in these soils are weak, this is due mainly to the high sand content, the low biological 

activity and low organic matter content (Fisher and Binkley, 2000). Consequently, it is possible to expect in 

sandy soils a slower recovery of infiltration after tree planting (Ampoorter et al., 2007). On the other hand, 

clay soils with smaller soil particles (e.g., clay and colloidal particles), interact intensively with cementation 

agents (e.g., organic matter and iron oxides) improving soil aggregation and increasing the shrink-swell 

forces that, positively affect the formation of soil structure (Fisher and Binkley, 2000; Regelink et al., 2015). 

Recovery of soil structure and its stability in clayey soils is essential for the faster recovery of infiltration 

after tree planting (Oades, 1993; Ampoorter et al., 2007; Regelink et al., 2015; Basche and DeLonge, 2017), 

as was evident in the comparisons between restored forests versus pastures and reference forests.  

Changes in infiltration after tree planting in forest restoration are related to time (restoration age), 

thereby, several studies have suggested that to achieve the pre-disturbance soil conditions it will probably 

take more than a decade (Zimmermann and Elsenbeer, 2008; Bonell et al., 2010; Ghimire et al., 2014). For 

example, Bonell et al. (2010) reported a small increase in infiltration during the first 10 years in Acacia 

auriculiformes planting in India, however, infiltration values remain low when compared with reference 

forests. Ziegler et al. (2004) argued that infiltration recovery is a process that occurs gradually over the years, 

with lower values in the beginning that will increase with the maturation of the forest. This remark is 

corroborated with our results, comparing the younger restored forests and older restored forests. The fact 

that infiltration in younger and older restored forests did not produce significant differences with reference 

forests highlights that the first decade of forest planting could recover the infiltration to a similar pre-

disturbance level. However, it will probably take decades to achieve a full infiltration recovery. In addition, 

the observed trend between older restored forests and reference forests showed an infiltration recovery, but 

the infiltration values are still far from the reference forests, indicating that to achieve full infiltration 

recovery will be difficult. On the other hand, our results reflect the short duration of most studies (12 years 

of mean restoration age) and as Zimmermann and Elsenbeer (2008) highlighted, the recovery process is still 

insufficiently understood and multi-decadal effects of tree planting has not been captured in most of the 

studies (Bonell et al., 2010). Furthermore, in the literature the scarcity of long-term studies measuring 

infiltration after tree planting is a limitation that need further research. 

 

2.5. Conclusions  

2.5.1. Final Remarks and Future Research Directions  

Our study reinforces the conclusion that infiltration is likely to increase after tree planting in forest 

restoration areas in the tropics. However, it must be noted that the available scientific evidence is severely 

limited. Based on this systematic review we have identified six knowledge gaps requiring future research 

efforts to advance our understanding of infiltration after tree planting in forest restoration: 



25 
 

 
 

1) Although infiltration is an important indicator of the possible pathways that water could take 

in the soil after rainfall, there is a need to study the water movement through the soil profile. Only a few 

studies in restored forests measured water percolation in depths greater than one meter. Moreover, most of 

the studies only considered saturated soil conditions in the infiltration measurements with little information 

on unsaturated soil conditions. Thus, tension infiltrometer measurements are recommended to describe the 

infiltration in these soil conditions (Salako et al., 2001).  

2) The interactions between infiltration and other soil attributes are poorly understood. Therefore, 

more experiments in restored forests should be performed, considering detailed information about soil 

structure (e.g., soil porosity), also taking into account the influence of soil faunal activity on infiltration. In 

this sense, there are studies in natural ecosystems that would allow a possible comparison with restored 

forests (Juhász et al., 2006; Cooper et al., 2012; de Pierre Castilho et al., 2016; Zenero et al., 2016). 

3) Details on the effects of forest restoration techniques and the level of disturbance during tree 

planting on infiltration are severely lacking. For example, the role that soil preparation, plant species, 

diversity of plants or tree densities could have on infiltration is virtually unknown. Indeed, most studies that 

measured infiltration were conducted in monoculture plantings, missing information for diverse plantings 

and native species. Therefore, more research comparing infiltration between different restoration 

techniques, considering the level of disturbance during tree planting, the effect of plant species and tree 

cover per se should be conducted.  

4) Many studies show that land use history has a great influence on infiltration recovery after tree 

planting (Zimmermann et al., 2006; Hassler et al., 2011), however, the majority of these studies are made 

without considering the type, duration, and intensity of land use prior to forest restoration. Thus, future 

research should examine this issue. 

5) The scarcity of long-term studies is a limitation. It is important to highlight that most studies 

that measured infiltration were short-term experiments (mean restoration age 12 years). This could be 

problematic and misleading when in some cases the findings in short-term experiments are extrapolated to 

long-term evaluations. 

6) There is scant information about recovery rate of infiltration after tree planting. The great 

majority of studies have focused in one measurement over time. Our results suggest that monitoring of 

infiltration in restored forests should be made at fixed time intervals, in order to understand the temporal 

variability of infiltration recovery.

Abstract 

Knowledge of soil hydraulic properties after forest restoration is essential to 
understand the recovery of hydrological processes, such as water infiltration. The increase of 
forest cover may improve water infiltration and soil hydraulic properties, but little is known 
about the response and extent to which forest restoration can affect these properties. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of forest restoration on surface saturated 
soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and to verify the Ks recovery to the pre-disturbance soil 
conditions. We sampled field Ks at the surface at 18 plots under three land use types: (i) a 
pasture; (ii) a restored forest using high-diversity-mix of plantings (85 native species) of 9 years 
of age; and (iii) a remnant forest patch, in Campinas municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil. We 
used the Beerkan method for the soil hydraulic characterization. Bulk density (?b), soil organic 
carbon content (OC), soil porosity and particle size data were also sampled. We found 
considerable differences in soil hydraulic properties between land use classes. The highest Ks 
were observed in remnant forest sites and the lowest Ks were associated with pastures sites. 
The Ks recovery differs markedly between restored forests. Our results strongly suggest that 
soil attributes and Ks recovery are influenced by the duration and intensity of land use prior to 
forest restoration. Attention needs to be given to management activities before, during and 
after forest restoration, especially, where the soil is still compacted, and Ks is low.

3.1. Introduction 

The global forest restoration movement based on natural regeneration and tree plantations has 

increased the tropical forest cover [1,2]. Nevertheless, soil hydraulic properties responses in these restored 

forests are virtually unknown [3,4]. Infiltration is a key hydrological process, which, among others, influences 

groundwater recharge, soil erosion and surface runoff. Indeed, one of the best parameters to understand 

and study infiltration is the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) [4,5]. The Ks is a soil property with the 

greatest spatial and temporal variability among soil properties. The Ks variability depend on many factors, 

such as soil types, land uses, soil depths, landscape positions, methods of measurement, physical and 

chemical soil attributes [6]. Despite this variation the Ks is a useful and sensitive indicator of the effect of 

land use change on soil hydro-physical dynamics [7], which exerts a dominating influence on the partitioning 



32 
 

of rainfall in vertical and lateral flow paths. Therefore, estimates of Ks are essential for describing and 

modelling hydrological processes [8]. 

The Atlantic Forest is one of the most important forest biomes of Brazil that has suffered intense 

pressure from human occupation, remaining approximately 12% of the original area [9]. Recently, the 

Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact has emerged to restore large areas of degraded land. This is the largest 

forest restoration initiative in Latin America with a target of restoring 15 million hectares of forest by 2050 

[10]. These efforts have a substantial impact on soil hydraulic properties and can be expected to affect the 

hydrological processes in the restored ecosystems. However, these hydrological implications are rarely 

considered in studies of forest restoration [11]. Current literature reviews in tropical landscapes suggest that 

forest restoration can enhance surface Ks [12,13]. Though, most studies on Ks recovery after forest 

restoration in tropical soils are emphasized in areas with natural regeneration or secondary succession 

[4,7,14–19]. Zimmerman et al. [17] at surface and near-surface (12.5 and 20 cm soil depth) in Brazilian 

Amazônia found non-significant Ks recovery during seven years of secondary succession after pasture 

abandonment. Recently, Leite et al. [19] by examining four sites of different ages in the Brazilian Caatinga: 

an abandoned pasture, a young forest (7 years), an intermediate forest (35 years) and an older forest (more 

than 55 years), observed that forest regrowth promotes surface Ks recovery, increasing progressively with 

time. On the other hand, the effect of active restoration on Ks has been much less studied [20]. Zwartendijk 

et al. [11] compared surface Ks recovery between degraded lands, semi-mature forest, 2–10 year old naturally 

regenerating vegetation and fallows that were actively reforested 6–9 years ago with 120 native species in 

Madagascar. They found higher Ks values in the semi-mature forest, followed by the active reforested sites, 

suggesting that active restoration may decrease the time to recover the soil hydraulic properties. Also, the 

impact of afforestation on Ks has been studied in teak (Tectona grandis) plantations at surface and near-surface 

(12.5 and 20 cm soil depth) in the Brazilian Amazônia, where after 10 years the teak plantation shows Ks 

recovery from pasture conditions for all soil depths, but Ks values are still distant from pre-disturbance 

conditions [4]. Similarly, an increase in Ks after afforestation practices has been reported by several other 

tropical studies [21–23].  

Tree planting to restore degraded lands is conducted in the expectation that soil hydraulic 

properties will be improved [13]. In order to understand the effect of forest restoration on Ks, we 

investigated the Ks recovery by field estimation under three land uses, namely pasture, 9?year?old restored 

forest and remnant forest. From our best knowledge, no studies have investigated the Ks recovery after 

planting native mixed-species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and compared the results with pasture and 

remnant forest. We hypothesized that forest restoration can recover the surface Ks to the pre-disturbance 

soil conditions. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does forest restoration recover top-soil Ks 

values that characterize the remnant forest? 2) Are the measured soil attributes between the land uses 

similar?

3.2. Materials and Methods  

3.2.1. Field Site 

This research was carried out in the county of Campinas, São Paulo State, Brazil (22o 54’ S, 46 o 

54’ W). The area is located inside the sub-basin of Atibaia river (2,800 km2), which belongs to the Piracicaba 

River basin. This region has suffered over 200 years of historical landscape changes. In the Atibaia sub-

basin, the main land uses are: native vegetation (33%), pasture lands (30%) and crops (17%), as well as the 

forest cover increased 5.7% in the last decade [24]. The mean annual precipitation is 1,700 mm and the 

mean annual temperature is 20 oC, with rainy months generally concentrated between October and March. 

The native vegetation in the area is classified as seasonal semi-deciduous forest [25]. The two soil types 

found in the study sites are Ultisols and Entisols [26], related to the diverse geomorphology of the region, 

which is located at the transition between the Atlantic Plateau and the Peripheral Depression 

geomorphological provinces. The rocks in the Atlantic Plateau are mainly composed of granites and gneises, 

while the Peripheral Depression is characterized by sedimentary rocks. The elevation ranges from 600 to 

900 m with an undulating topography and the presence of slopes higher than 20% [27]. 

3.2.2. Experimental Design 

The sites were selected to capture variation in soil attributes. Also, the sites accessability was taken 

into account in this selection. We examined the following land use classes: pasture, restored forest and 

remnant forest. In each class we selected two sites or toposequences (Figure 1), under pasture (P1 and P2), 

under restored forest (R3 and R4), and under remnant forest (F5 and F6). The maximum separation 

distances among these sites was 15 km in a straight line.

The length of each toposequence was constrained by topography and varied between 100 and 150 

m. Each site was divided into three landscape positions (upslope (U), midslope (M) and downslope (D)). 

Within each landscape position, we located one plot (7 x 7 m in size), resulting in 18 plots altogether. 

Detailed characteristcs of the three land use classes are as follows.  

The Pasture Site P1 (22°49’24’’ S, 46°54’39’’ W) and P2 (22°54’38” S, 46°53’26” W) were 

characterised by a dense cover of grass. The dominant grass species is Urochloa brizantha. Information 

obtained with landholders revealed that the pasture sites have been heavily grazed for more than 20 years 

and have a stocking rate between 1 to 1.5 animal units ha-1. The measurements at these sites represent the 

Ks and soil attributes before forest restoration actions.  

The Restored Forest Sites (R3 and R4) were 9 years old when sampled and located in Fazenda 

Guariroba (22° 53’48” S, 46°54’28” W). The forest restoration process of an area of 300 ha began in 2007. 

The mixed plantation with high-diversity-mix of seedlings (85 native species), aimed to provide economical 

insurance and ensure successional processes to landowners [28,29]. Site preparation included; grass control 

through herbicide applications and control of leaf-cutter ants by the distribution of insecticide baits. Direct 

seedling planting (3 x 2 m spacing) took place after conventional tillage. The mixed plantation also used 

fertilizer and irrigation at the time of planting and during the first year [28,30]. Aerial photographs and 

interviews with local peoples showed that land use history differ between restored forest sites (Appendix 

B). Both restored forests were originally deforested more than 100 years ago and planted with coffee (Coffea 

arabica) during the first decades of the 20th century. After the coffee plantation, the Restored Forest R3 was 

planted with eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.), this abandoned forest existed until 2006 without commercial 

purpose, although a frequent grazing of cattle occurred, then was harvested and grazing continued one year 

before the forest restoration. The eucalyptus harvest was made by motor-manual operations and farm 

tractor forwarded the logs. The vegetation in the Restored Forest R3 prior to restoration activities consisted 

in low shrub and grasses. On the other hand, the Restored Forest R4 after the coffee plantation was used 

as pastures for livestock breeding until 1986, subsequently was planted again to coffee and agricultural 

terraces were made with heavy track machinery. Then, the coffee plantation was replaced by pasture in 1996, 

which was similar to pastures sites (P1 and P2), dominated by grass species U. brizantha and without natural 

regeneration. 

The Forest Sites (F5 and F6), used as a reference for soil attributes are located in Ribeirão 

Cachoeira forest (22°50’13’’ S, 46°55’58’’ W), the second largest natural remnant forest with 245 ha in the 

county of Campinas. The forest present a high tree species diversity, with an average canopy stature of 15 

m and emergent trees reaching up to 35 m tall [31]. 

3.2.3. Soil Sampling and Measurements 

The first field campaing started in February and ended in March 2017. A total of four disturbed 

soil samples were collected per plot to determine the soil particle size distribution (PSD) and the soil organic 

carbon content (OC). The PSD was determined by the hydrometer method and soil texture classified 



35 
 

 
 

according to the USDA standards [32]. The OC was determined by the Walkley-Black method [33]. In 

addition, four undisturbed soil cores (0.05 m in height and 0.05 m in diameter) were also collected per plot 

at the depth of 0 to 0.05 m to determine soil macroporosity (Mac) and microporosity (Mic), using the 

Richards pressure chamber with application of 6kPa suction [34]. 

Infiltration measurements were taken in a second field campaing during the month of June 2017 

(dry season). We conducted a Ks characterization, using the Beerkan method [35], referred to as BEST. We 

chose the BEST test because it is a simple, fast and inexpensive method [36–38]. At each plot, we carried 

out seven infiltration runs using a steel ring with an inner diameter of 0.16 m inserted approximately 0.01 

m into the soil surface, with a minimum distance between measurements of 2 m. Before ring insertion, the 

litter was removed and, if necessary, the grass and ground cover were cut in order to expose the soil surface. 

Sampling point selection was influenced by suitable ground conditions for measurment and constraints such 

as tree roots, rocks and variations in microtopography. For each infiltration run, we collected one 

undisturbed soil core (0.05 m in height and 0.05 m in diameter) at the 0 to 0.05 m depth. We used the 

undisturbed soil cores to determine the initial volumetric soil water content (?i), the soil bulk density (?b) 

and total soil porosity (Pt) assuming a particle density of 2.65 g cm–3 [39]. In each measurement, a known 

volume (150 mL) was repeatedly poured into the cylinder and the time needed for the complete infiltration 

of this volume was logged. We repeated the procedure until the difference in infiltration time between two 

or three consecutives trials became negligible. At the end of each infiltration test, we collected a disturbed 

soil sample inside the ring area to determine the saturated gravimetric water content, and thus the satured 

volumetric water content (?s) was calculated using the ?b. A total of 126 experimental cumulative infiltrations, 

I(t) (L), versus time, t (T), were then deduced, 42 for each land use, 21 for each site and 7 for each plot. 

3.2.4. Estimating and Selecting the BEST Algorithm 

The BEST-steady algorithm by Bagarello et al. [40] was used to obtain the Ks (KsB, the subscript B 

is used to indicate BEST-steady). This choice was made since it allows to obtain a higher success percentage 

of the infiltration runs, as compared with other possibles algorithms, such as BEST-slope [41], and BEST-

intercept [42], whose data require fitting to the transient stage of the infiltration run. Another expected 

advantage of the BEST-steady algorithm is that the possible problems associated with the use of the 

transient infiltration data are avoided. The BEST-steady expresses the KsB with the following equation [43]:

=   (1) 

Where is (L T-1) and bs (L) are respectively the slope and the intercept of the regression line fitted 

to the data describing steady-state conditions on the cumulative infiltration I (L) versus t (T) plot. Taking 

into account that BEST focuses on the Brooks and Corey relationship for hydraulic conductivity [44], the 

A (L-1) and C constants are defined as follows [35]:

Where ? and ? are infiltration coefficients commonly set at 0.75 and 0.6 as explained by 

Lassabatere et al. [3,7,16,19], r (L) is the radius of the disk source, ? is a shape parameter that is estimated 

from the capillary models [45], ?i and ?s are the initial and final water contents, respectively. Note that ?i 

should not exceed 0.25 ?s, however Di Prima et al. [43] showed that BEST-steady can be applied in initially 

wetter soil conditions (?i &gt; 0.25 ?s) without an appreciable loss of accuracy in the predictions of Ks. 

Therefore, as suggested by Cullotta et al. [46], the ?i was not considered to affect the reliability of the 

predicted Ks. On the other hand, the BEST-steady algorithm failure in some sampling points, providing 

negative Ks values and affecting the reliability of measured Ks. For this reason, we also estimated Ks for the 

whole data set by the near Steady-state phase of a Beerkan infiltration run (SSBI - KsS, the subscript S is used 

to indicate Steady-state) [47]. This method is attractive for a simple soil hydraulic characterization but testing 

the ability of this procedure to estimate Ks is necessary. Indeed, in scientific literature there is no exhaustive 

testing of the performances of the SSBI method, notwithstanding that this method has a noticeable practical 

interest. This method estimates Ks through a simple Beerkan infiltration test and an estimate of the so-called 

sorptive parameter, ?* (L-1), expressing the relative importance of gravity and capillary forces during a 

ponding infiltration process [48,49]. With this method KsS is estimated by the following equation [47]:

Where ?w is a dimensionless constant related to the shape of the infiltration front and is set at 

1.818 [50]. In this investigation, we considered ?* as a constant and equal to 0.012 mm-1, since it was found 

to be usable in tropical soils [47,51]. The reasons of these choice were that we did not find in the literature 

other specific support for using a different ?* value for tropical soils. Following Bagarello et al. [47], the 

BEST-steady algorithm was chosen to check the SSBI method by comparing KsB and KsS in terms of factors 

of difference (FoD), calculated as the highest value between KsB and KsS divided by the lowest value between 

KsB and KsS. Differences between KsB and KsS not exceeding a factor of two were considered indicative of 

similar estimates [49]. 

3.2.5. Data Analysis 

Data sets were summarized by calculating the mean and the associated coefficient of variation 

(CV). Following similar investigations [37,52], a unique value of clay, silt, sand, OC, ?b, total porosity, 

macroporosity, microporosity and ?i was determined for each plot by averaging the measured values, 

considering the small size of the sampled areas [52]. The hypothesis of normal distribution of both the 



37 
 

 
 

untransformed and the log-transformed Ks data were tested by the Lilliefors test [53]. The other parameters 

were assumed normally distributed, and thus, no transformation was performed on these data before 

statistical analysis [54,55]. Treatment means were calculated according to the statistical distribution of the 

data, e.g., geometric means for Ks (log-normal distribution) and arithmetic means for all other parameters 

(normal distribution) [56]. According to Lee et al. [55] the appropriate CV expression for a log-normal 

distribution was calculated for the geometric means, and the usual CV was calculated for the arithmetic 

means. Statistical comparison was conducted using two-tailed t-tests, whereas the Tukey Honestly 

Significant Difference test was applied to compare the data sets. The ln-transformed KsS was used in the 

statistical comparison. A probability level, p = 0.05, was used for all statistical analyses. All analyses were 

carried out in the statistical programming software R [57].  

 

3.3. Results 

3.3.1. Differences in Soil Attributes among Study Sites 

The PSD showed considerable differences among the soils. Most of the sampled plots presented 

sandy loam (P1U, P1M, P1D, R3U, R3M, RD, F5U and F5D) and sandy clay loam textures (R4U, R4M, 

R4D and F5M), and the rest clay loam (P2M, F6U and F6M) and loamy textures (P2U, P2D and F6D). The 

OC ranged from 14.76 to 35.37 g Kg-1 under Pastures (P1 and P2), from 10.46 to 24.60 g Kg-1 under 

Restored Forests (R3 and R4) and from 17.53 to 48.59 g Kg-1 under Remnant Forests (F5 and F6). The ?b 

values ranged between 1.12 and 1.40 g cm-3 in the pastures, for the restored forests the values ranged from 

1.09 to 1.52 g cm–3, while in the remnant forests the values ranged from 0.88 to 1.25 g cm-3. The Pt varied 

from 0.47 to 0.58 cm3 cm-3 in the pastures, from 0.43 to 0.59 cm3 cm-3 in the restored forests and 0.53 to 

0.67 cm3 cm-3 in the remnant forests. In general, the highest soil Mac values were observed in the remnant 

forests, the intermediate values in restored forests and the lowest values in the pastures. In contrast, the soil 

Mic was greater in the pastures, intermediate in the restored forests and lower in the remnant forests. The 

mean ?i at the time of the Beerkan infiltration run varied between 0.16 and 0.37 cm3 cm-3 and the soil was 

significantly wetter in plots P2M, R4U and R4M (Table 1).

3.3.2. Estimating and Selecting the BEST Algorithm 

Overall the Beerkan method used in this study was found to be robust to measure the Ks in the 

field. However, the BEST-steady algorithm yielded physically plausible estimates (e.g., positive Ks values) in 

108 of 126 infiltration runs (85.7% of the cases). The percentage of successful runs was 40 of 42 runs 

(95.2%) both in the pasture sites and restored forest. With reference to the Remnant Forest (F5 and F6), 

BEST-steady led to failure rate value of 33.3%, leading to lack of estimates in 14 of 42 infiltration runs. In 

these cases, convex cumulative infiltration shaped data always produced a negative intercept of the straight 

line fitted to the data describing steady-state conditions, which yielded negative Ks values (Figure 2). On the 

other hand, the SSBI method always yielded physically plausible estimates (e.g., positive Ks values). 

 

 
 

Figure 2. Illustrative examples of the influence of the shape of the cumulative infiltrations on the discrepancies occurring between 
BEST-steady and the SSBI method. (a) Concave-shaped cumulative infiltration curve in which the intercept, bs (mm), of the 
straight line interpolating the last I vs. t data points is positive and the FoD between the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity 
values estimated with BEST-steady (KsB) and the SSBI method (KsS) is small. (b) Convex-shaped cumulative infiltration curve 
with a negative intercept yielding null KsB. 

 

Small differences were found between the KsB and KsS estimates (Figure 3). The means of KsS 

differed from the corresponding values of KsB, by a factor not exceeding 1.81. The individual determination 

(e.g., point by point) of the factors of difference, FoD, did not exceed 2.37 (mean of FoD is equal to 1.51) 

and they were less than 2 and 1.5 in the 90% and 53% of the cases, respectively. Therefore, it can be argued 

that the BEST-steady and SSBI method led to similar estimates, given that the individual FoD values were 

lower than two in almost all cases.

and P2 for pasture, R3 and R4 for restored forest and F5 and F6 for remnant forest. 

 

The failure in the BEST-steady algorithm is reported by several studies in subtropical soils, where 

OC exceeds 5%. This failure is normally related to the occurrence of hydrophobic conditions [43,46,58]. 

Nevertheless, our soils showed lower OC values (less than 5%). In addition, the soil hydrophobicity is a 

complex property and poorly studied in tropical soils [59,60]. Other factors that probably contributed to the 

BEST-steady algorithm failure are the heterogeneous soil structure, changes in soil structure during 

measurement, initial soil moisture and temperature [61,62]. For these reasons, the failure of the BEST-steady 

algorithm should be addressed in detail by future studies, considering a detailed physical, chemical and 

mineralogical analyses. Hereafter, for the sake of reliable Ks values and comparison across study sites, only 

the KsS values estimated using the SSBI method were considered. This choice was supported by the fact that 

the SSBI method allowed us to maintain the integrity of the dataset. In addition, the KsS values ranged 

between 3 and 934 mm h-1, with a high variability inside all study sites. 

3.3.3. Saturated Soil Hydraulic Conductivity (Ks) Characterization 

Evaluating the surface Ks values by soil texture, greater Ks variation was found in soils with higher 

clay content, contrasting with lower variation in soils with higher sand content. Also, soils with higher sand 

content did not show the higher Ks. In general, the lowest Ks values occurred in pastures plots, for example, 

in Pasture P1 the Ks ranged from 10 to 320 mm h-1, and in pasture P2 Ks ranged from 4 to 37 mm h-1, 

whereas the highest Ks values were observed in most remnant forest plots. The sandy loam texture 

highlighted the large differences between Ks in the Restored Forest R3 and Pasture Plots (P1U and P1M). 

In this case, the Ks in the Restored Forest R3 varied from 49 to 267 mm h-1, with the higher Ks evidenced at 

the Restored Forest Plot R3D (average of 180 mm h-1), moreover, the Ks was similar to the Pasture Plot 

P1D (average of 110 mm h-1) and most remnant forest plots. For the Remnant Forest F5, the Ks varied from 

18 to 660 mm h-1, showing the higher Ks at Remnant Forest Plot F5U (average of 247 mm h-1), which differs 

from Pasture Plots (P1U and P1M), but, not from Restored Forest R3. In contrast, the Ks at Remnant Forest 



41 
 

 
 

Plot F5D (average of 68 mm h-1) exhibited a similar Ks in relation to pasture and restored forest plots. For 

the sandy clay loam texture, the Ks in the Restored Forest R4 (from 6 to 256 mm h-1 and average of 54 mm 

h-1) was significantly different from the Remnant Forest Plot F5M (average of 387 mm h-1), furthermore, all 

the plots in the Restored Forest R4 had low Ks variability, similar to the pasture land use. Finally, clay loam 

and loam textures showed the same comparison among land uses, characterized by marked differences 

between lower Ks in the Pasture 2 and higher Ks in the Remnant Forest F6. In particular, the Remnant Forest 

F6 evidenced the higher Ks variability (from 33 to 934 mm h-1) in the study sites (Figure 4).

Statistical comparision of KsS revealed no significant differences between the Restored Forest (R3) 

and the Remnant Forest (F5 and F6). However, significant differences between the Restored Forest (R4) 

and remnant forest were detected, indicating the similarity with the Pastures (P1 and P2) (Table 2).

3.4. Discussion 

3.4.1. Effects of Land Use on Soil Attributes and Ks 

Although the soils in the study area showed some variability, this was overcome by choosing sites 

and landscape positions within the different land uses that presented similar soil textural classes in the 

surface horizon. This approach allowed us to group and compare the soil attributes and Ks (Figure 4). In 

general, important differences were observed in the soil attributes and Ks between land use classes. These 

differences could be related to many factors, such as; intensity of past land use [4,23], spatial and topographic 

variations in soil types along the toposequences [63,64], density and diversity of plants, root system, 

vegetation type, canopy cover and soil faunal activity, among others [19]. Unfortunately, the influence of 

these factors on soil attributes and Ks after forest restoration is poorly understood and needs to be included 

in future studies. 

Pasture. As expected, Ks was significantly lower under pasture plots than restored forest and 

remnant forest plots. This result was directly related to the highest ?b found in the study pastures, which 

influences the higher soil Mic and lower soil Mac values [65]. Similar findings have been reported be several 

authors [13-15]. An exception to this was related to Pasture Plot P1D, which showed similar Ks values 

compared to the restored forest and remnant forest in the sandy loam texture, suggesting lower soil 

compaction, and consequently higher soil Mac. Also, the highest sand content found in this plot could help 

to explain this result. Moreover, the present results illustrate the Ks spatial variability in two different pasture 

sites, characterized by a low variation in Ks values. This could be due to the soil compaction [4,13], and the 

duration of pasture use in the land use history, which is one of the most important factor for Ks variability 

over time [15,17], as well as the cattle grazing intensity could have influenced the Ks variability in the pasture 

plots [7]. Otherwise, the lower soil faunal activity and organic matter in pasture land uses are important 

factors when analyzing the soil attributes [15,56]. Especially, the Pasture Plots P1U, P2U and P2M, had OC 

similar to the remnant forest. These similarities are closely linked to carbon inputs in pastures sites, where 

the root system of grasses, the animal-derived organic matter and application of fertilizers might have 

increased the organic substrate [20,65]. In contrast, Pasture Plots P1M, P1D and P2D showed the lowest 

OC values in pasture plots, which could be attributed in part to the higher sand contents in these plots. 

Restored forest. The soil texture, understory vegetation (Figure 1) and intensity of past land use were 

different in the Restored Forest sites (R3 and R4), these are the most likely reasons for the differences in 

soil attributes and Ks values between both restored forests [23,66]. Also, it is important to underscore that 

this result could have been influenced by possible soil compaction during mechanized soil preparation 

during the forest restoration [67]. The most important soil attributes of the Ks differentiation between 

restored forest sites was the ?b and OC. For example, the higher Ks in the Restored Forest Plot R3D was 

associated to the lowest ?b and higher OC values. Overall, the Restored Forest R3 with higher sand content 

(sandy loam texture), exhibited lower OC, lower soil Mic, lower ?b, higher soil Mac and higher Ks than 

Restored Forest R4. The higher Ks in Restored Forest 3, relative to pasture plots with similar soil texture 



43 
 

 
 

(P1U and P1M), is consistent with the results under teak plantation in the Brazilian Amazônia [4] and pine 

plantation in Nepal [23]. Furthermore, plots in the Restored Forest R3 showed no significant differences in 

Ks from most remnant forest plots. These results can be linked to the land use history in the Restored Forest 

R3, where the presence of abandoned eucalyptus forest with a canopy structure for more than 50 years, 

influenced the low trampling pressure and machinery traffic intensities, suggesting a litter accumulation that 

could have protected the soil surface during this period [68,69]. 

In the second situation, the Restored Forest R4 with higher clay content (sandy clay loam texture), 

exhibited higher OC, higher ?b and lower Ks than Restored Forest R3. In particular, the lower Ks compared 

to the Remnant Forest Plot (F5M) with a similar soil texture, clearly indicates that the full return to pre-

disturbance conditions is still far-off [22]. On the other hand, sandy clay loam texture did not include pasture 

plots, however, pasture Ks in this soil texture could be assumed to be similar to the Pastures Sites (P1 and 

P2), considering the low spatial Ks variability observed in the pasture land use. Thus, the Restored Forest R4 

showed no significant differences in Ks with pasture sites. This result can be related to past land use intensity 

in the Restored Forest R4, in which the combination of coffee plantation and pastures, lead to greater soil 

exposure, also, trampling pressure and construction of agricultural terraces, could have caused erosion and 

soil compaction before the forest restoration. The present results agree with several studies [4,16,23], which 

suggest that Ks decrease with increasing land use intensity, as well as Ks recovery will be longer in view of 

the intensive land use. Filoso et al. [13] argued that in some cases the recovery of infiltration after forest 

restoration may be extremely difficult, because of the absence of natural understory vegetation. This 

research did not directly quantify the herbaceous cover, but in the field we observed that natural regeneration 

in the Restored Forest R4 is impeded by the dominance of invasive grass species (U. brizantha), which is also 

associated with the open canopy conditions. Conversely Restored Forest R3 presented visually, a canopy 

structure with greater understory vegetation. Indeed, the canopy cover determines the interception rainfall, 

reducing raindrop impact and surface sealing, which could enhance the Ks [19]. Additionally, the higher ?b 

values in Restored Forest R4, are an indication of lower root and soil organism presence [70], this may 

reduce the plant seed germination, reduce root growth and decrease soil oxygen availability, becoming an 

ecological filter in the natural regeneration processes [71,72]. Zimmerman et al. [17] reported that invasive 

species could delay the Ks recovery in Brazilian Amazônia after a decade of pasture abandonment.  

Remnant forest. Comparing remnant forest plots and pastures plots in the sandy loam, clay loam 

and loam textures allowed to detect significantly higher Ks in remnant forest plots. In the case of the sandy 

clay loam texture the Remnant Forest Plot F5M showed significantly higher Ks than plots in the Restored 

Forest R4. In contrast, sandy loam texture showed no significant differences between plots of Restored 

Forest 3 and Remnant Forest Plot F5U. These results are related to the lowest ?b and higher Mac values that 

favor the Ks, suggesting a higher soil pore connectivity. In the specific case of Remnant Forest Plot F5D in 

the sandy loam texture, no significant differences were found in relation to pasture plots (P1U and P1M). 

This result can be associated with the high ?b and a consequent increase in the soil Mic that was noted in the 

Remnant Forest Plot F5D. The soil attributes and Ks values in remnant forest sites could be explained by 



44 
 

the longer time that these forests have remained undisturbed, which allows to develop a better soil structure 

and store more soil carbon [19,66]. These findings are in agreement with those reported by several other 

studies in the Atlantic Forest [63,65]. Additionally, the Ks spatial variability observed in both remnant forests 

is in line with previous work of Hassler et al. [7], who attributed the Ks variability in Panama forest soils to 

overland flows that results in erosion [19]. Other factors that might have caused the Ks spatial variability in 

remnant forest plots are the steepness of sample plots and the soil distribution in the landscape positions 

(U, M, D) influenced by contrasting slope and topography.  

3.4.2. Management Implications 

The fact that Restored Forests R3 and R4, showed clear differences in Ks recovery and soil 

attributes, may provide evidence that, in some cases, simply planting trees is not, in itself, enough to recover 

the soil attributes to the pre-disturbance soil conditions [23]. Attention needs to be given to management 

activities before, during and after forest restoration, especially, where the soil is still compacted, and Ks is 

low. From this point of view, it is therefore important that monitoring forest restoration programs include 

collection of soil compaction and Ks data to understand the initial compaction degree and water infiltration, 

reinforcing the need to compare these values with the pre-disturbance soil conditions. After assessing soil 

compaction and infiltration at the restored forests, management practices could be implemented to alleviate 

soil compaction, such as mechanical loosening techniques (e.g., deep ripping and subsoiling), which may 

improve plant growth [73,74]. In addition, some technical methods in forest restoration that have shown to 

aid the natural regeneration and soil recovery are: suppressing weedy vegetation and, maintenance and 

enrichment planting [28]. 

If the Pasture Sites (P1 and P2) presented here represent the planted pastures of the Atlantic 

Forest, we could observe that, water infiltration is drastically affected in most cases, regardless of the soil 

texture. This result and negative effects of pastures that have been heavily grazed are well documented 

[4,15,17] and have also been confirmed in the present research. Indeed, according to Martínez and Zinck 

[15] pasture degradation can be improved by rotational grazing and introduction of silvopastoral systems 

during the pasture management. Moreover, there are an increasing number of reports regarding different 

tropical land uses, suggesting that lowers Ks may lead to less groundwater recharge and increases in overland 

flow frequency [3,7,16,19]. Thus, our results reinforce the need for better management practices in the 

pastures and restored forests to avoid the soil erosion, conserve water and create opportunities to enhance 

water infiltration [75].  

 

3.5. Conclusions 

In this study, the hypothesis that the forest restoration can recover the surface Ks to the pre-

disturbance soil conditions was not supported for both restored forest sites (R3 and R4). We found two 

different situations with marked differences in soil attributes and Ks recovery between restored forest sites. 



45 
 

 
 

Our results strongly suggest that soil attributes and surface Ks recovery are influenced by the duration and 

intensity of land use prior to forest restoration: while the Restored Forest R3 with a previous lower intensity 

of land use showed similar Ks to the remnant forest sites, the Ks recovery in Restored Forest R4 is still far-

off from these remnant forest sites due to greater exposure of the soil and trampling pressure during the 

land use history. The present results further illustrate that the measured soil attributes were different 

between land use classes: pasture, restored forest and remnant forest. They also bring out the inverse 

relationship between Ks and ?b, where the Ks increase as a result of a decrease in ?b, consequently, the 

dominance of macropores over micropores, which facilitate the water infiltration.

Abstract 

Tree planting and natural regeneration are the main approaches to achieve global 
forest restoration targets, affecting multiple hydrological processes, such as infiltration of 
rainfall. Our understanding of the effect of land use history and vegetation on the recovery of 
water infiltration and soil attributes in both restoration strategies is limited. Therefore, we 
investigated the recovery of top-soil saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil physical and 
hydraulic properties in five land use types: (i) a secondary old-growth forest; (ii) a forest 
established through assisted passive restoration 11 years ago; (iii) an actively restored forest, 
with a more intensive land use history and 11 years of age; (iv) a pasture with low-intensity use; 
and (v) a pasture with high-intensity use, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For these land use 
types, we determined the historical land use patterns and conducted soil sampling, using the 
Beerkan method to determine Ks values in the field. We also measured tree basal area, canopy 
cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness in forest covers. The Ks decreased 
when land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions. Our results indicate that 
land use legacy is a crucial factor to explain the current difference in soil and vegetation 
attributes among study sites.

4.1. Introduction 

Forest restoration strategies are being implemented around the world through ambitious 

international (e.g., Bonne Challenge and New York Declaration on Forests), regional (e.g., Initiative 20×20 

and AFR100) and national initiatives such as restoration plans in many countries [1]. Consequently, 

secondary forests have expanded in tropical regions [1,2]. In Brazil, the location of our study area, the 

“Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact” aims by 2050 to increase the current forest cover from 17% to at least 

30%, with a restoration target of 15 million hectares [3]. These initiatives include both passive and active 

restoration strategies. Passive ecological restoration refers to spontaneous recovery of tree species in an 

ecosystem that has been damaged, while assisted passive restoration involves human interventions to assist 

natural regeneration [4,5]. This can include introduction of propagules and removal of invasive species and 



52 
 

persistent disturbances, for example, fire or livestock grazing [4]. On the other hand, active restoration 

requires a higher human intervention through planting of tree seedlings to accelerate the recovery process 

[6,7]. 

Both restoration approaches have been shown to impact positively the provision of ecosystem 

services, as well recovering biodiversity and ecosystem functions [8]. However, most restoration research 

around the world has focused on aboveground plant communities, whilst the belowground environment 

(e.g., soil physical and hydraulic properties) has been poorly studied [9,10]. For example, the response of the 

infiltration process, and soil physical and hydraulic properties after forest restoration is virtually unknown 

[11]. A crucial parameter in the infiltration process is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), which 

influences water percolation through the soil matrix [12,13]. It is well known from previous studies that Ks 

is highly variable compared to other soil physical properties [14,15]. In fact, the Ks depends strongly on the 

highly variable soil structure, and it is known to vary several orders of magnitude [16,17], especially on 

forested soils [18,19]. In general, Ks recovery and soil hydraulic properties have been reported separately in 

passive [20–24] and active [25–28] restoration, but few comparisons between both restoration strategies 

have been conducted. Lozano-Baez et al. [28] investigated the surface Ks recovery under a nine-year-old 

actively restored forest in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and observed that the land use prior to forest 

restoration influences the Ks recovery. Moreover, the few recent comparisons between active and passive 

restoration show contradictory results. For instance, Ks at 12.5 cm depth in Brazilian Amazônia was higher 

under a 15-year-old passively restored forest than a 10-year-old tree plantation [11]. In contrast, other 

authors in Madagascar found much lower surface Ks in 2–10-year-old naturally regenerating fallow than 

actively restored forest of 6–9 years of age [29]. Most previous studies have assessed the recovery of soil 

physical and hydraulic properties without addressing the relationships among soil, vegetation and land use 

history. These relationships are fundamental to better understand the recovery process (e.g., resilience of 

the ecosystem) and successional trajectories after forest restoration [30,31]. Foster et al. [32] argued that the 

imprints of past land use on ecosystems may persist for decades to centuries. In particular, after forest 

restoration, such imprints of past land use on soil (e.g., Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties) may persist 

for a time frame of more than a decade, as suggested by several studies [12,26,33]. However, the above-

mentioned mechanisms and relationships that affect the recovery process are poorly understood. 

As part of a larger research effort investing the effects of forest restoration on Ks, this study aimed 

to extend the work of Lozano-Baez et al. [28] at a new location. Apart from presenting new Ks data for 

pastures with different land use intensities and a secondary old-growth forest, this paper includes the first 

measurements of Ks for a forest established through assisted passive restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic 

Forest. We further quantified and compared the Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties recovery of active 

vs. assisted passive restoration strategies from the same restoration program described by Lozano-Baez et 

al. [28]. We examined whether differences in land use history led to differences in these soil attributes (e.g., 

Ks, bulk density, soil organic carbon content, soil porosity, initial and saturated soil water content) and 

vegetation attributes (e.g., basal area, canopy cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness). We 

studied five land-cover types: (i) a secondary old-growth forest, used as a reference forest (hereafter, RF); 



53 
 

 
 

(ii) a forest established through assisted passive restoration (hereafter, APR); (iii) an actively restored forest 

(hereafter, AR); (iv) a pasture with low-intensity use (hereafter, LiP); and (v) a pasture with high-intensity 

use (hereafter, HiP). In forest stands, we associated the recovery of Ks, soil physical and hydraulic properties 

with the vegetation attributes. We hypothesized that Ks would vary with intensity of land use in the past 

among land-cover types as follows: RF &gt; APR &gt; AR &gt; LiP &gt; HiP. As the AR site had a more intensive 

land use history, we expected that Ks recovery and vegetation attributes would be higher in the APR. 

 

4.2. Materials and Methods  

4.2.1. Study Area 

The study area is located in the county of Campinas (22°53? S, 46°54? W), São Paulo State, 

Southeast Brazil (Figure 1). The climate in this region is classified as Cwa according to the Köppen 

classification mean annual precipitation is 1,700 mm and mean annual temperature is 20 °C, with dry winters 

and wet summers [34]. Our study sites are located at the transition between the Atlantic Plateau and the 

Peripheral Depression geomorphological provinces [35]. The soils are classified as Ultisols [36] and the 

original vegetation in this area is a seasonal semi-deciduous forest, belonging to the Atlantic Forest biome. 

This region is highly fragmented, because of 200 years of historical landscape changes [37]. In particular, 

our study area is located inside the sub-basin of the Atibaia River where the main land uses are native 

vegetation and pastureland, occupying 33% and 30% of the sub-basin, respectively. The native vegetation 

includes Atlantic Forest remnants with different sizes and ages [38].

Within this area, we selected five land uses to measure soil physical and hydraulic properties, 

vegetation structure and diversity (Figure 2). In general, the deforestation of our study area already existed 

at the beginning of the 19th century, with the objective of introducing coffee (Coffea arabica) plantations. 

However, after the crisis in coffee cultivation during the early 20th century, the plantations were gradually 

replaced by pastures.

intensity Pasture; HiP, High-intensity Pasture. 

 

Land use history for the study sites was reconstructed based on interviews with the local 

population and aerial photographs taken in 1968, 1978, 1994, 2005 and 2017. The RF site is a secondary 



55 
 

 
 

old-growth forest characterized by having the highest slope between the study sites, which was 28.8 ± 4.9% 

(SD). The slope was measured in the study plots with laser distance meter. Site RF was used as a control 

area to assess reference values for soil physical and hydraulic properties. According to interviews, in the 

early 20th century, this site was affected by natural fire disturbances and it was partially cleared at least once 

in the past for agricultural purposes. Moreover, aerial photographs showed that forest cover in most of the 

area was established and has increased since 1968. In this context, all RF plots were located in sites with 

forest cover in the last 40 years. 

Site APR is located adjacent to the LiP. The slope (28.1 ± 2.8%) was similar to the RF. From 1968 

to 1994, it was used for milk cattle grazing. Then, the area was abandoned and remained without a specific 

land use until 2007, leaving the forest to naturally regrow over 12 years. In 2007, to decide the best 

restoration strategy for the area, the “Diagnostic” protocol proposed by Rodrigues et al. [37] was 

implemented. This protocol allowed identifying the initial environmental situation and evaluating the 

potential of autogenic restoration of the area. Considering that this site evidenced favorable abiotic and 

biotic conditions (e.g., naturally regenerating native plants) for native plant establishment (Appendix C), the 

restoration diagnosis was of fair potential for autogenic restoration. Thus, forest restoration techniques 

included the encouragement of regenerating individual native trees and shrubs by manual and chemical 

control of invasive grasses. Moreover, enrichment plantings with native tree species were also implemented 

in patches without natural regeneration. In this regard, our measurements reflect the effect of 11 years of 

APR on a soil with a previous second-growth forest. 

At AR site, the slope (22.8 ± 1.7%) was lower than the RF and APR. Initially, this site was used 

for dairy cattle grazing from 1968 to 1986. Later, it was replaced by coffee plantations until 1994. It is 

important to emphasize that, at the beginning of the coffee plantation phase, widespread terracing was 

implemented. Then, in 1994, the coffee was replaced by pastures with Urochloa brizantha for beef cattle 

grazing. In 2007, the “Diagnostic” protocol mentioned previously was implemented. Given that AR site 

evidenced very few spontaneously regenerating seedlings and degraded environmental conditions that 

limited the passive restoration strategy, the restoration diagnosis in this area was of very low potential for 

autogenic restoration. Thus, AR was implemented through a restoration model that aimed to provide 

economical insurance and ensure successional processes to landowners [37]. Restoration plantings were 

implemented as mixed plantation with high-diversity-mix of seedlings (&gt;50 native trees species). During the 

planting, these species were organized in fourth groups (e.g., initial, filling, middle and final species) 

according to the rate of growth and commercial value. Initial species (e.g., Croton floribundus, Senegalia polyphylla 

and Schinus terebinthifolius) can be harvested for fuel production in 10–15 years, and are characteristically fast-

growing, providing fast soil coverage and beneficial initial conditions for other species growth. Filling 

species (e.g., Croton urucurana, Gochnatia polymorpha and Trema micrantha) are also fast-growing species planted 

in the same line as the species. Middle species (e.g., Astronium graveolens, Gallesia integrifolia and Machaerium 

stipitatum) can be harvested during Years 20–25 and are more valuable wood species that will replace the 

initial and filling species. Final species (e.g., Aspidosperma polyneuron, Cariniana estrellensis and Cariniana legalis) 



56 
 

are narrow canopy and slow-growing species that can be harvested during Years 40–45 for luxury and 

finished carpentry. The species planted are listed in Appendix D. The total density of seedling was 1,660 

ind·ha?1, in a 3 m × 2 m spacing, using mechanized soil preparation. Before planting, invasive grasses were 

controlled through herbicide application. Fertilizers and irrigation were applied at the time of planting and 

during the first year [37,39]. The initial environmental conditions for AR are presented in Appendix E.  As 

a result, our measurement in this restoration site represent the effect of 11 years of active restoration on 

highly degraded soil, with an intense land use history. 

Site LiP with a slope of 22.7 ± 2.1% is located adjacent to the HiP, and both sites share a similar 

land use history until 2008. Since this year, in the LiP, grazing has been intermittent and with low 

productivity (e.g., stocking rate lower than two livestock units per hectare). During our field campaign, the 

vegetative cover in the LiP was dominated by the same grass species (U. brizantha), with a mean height about 

50 cm and isolated native trees, shrub species and non-native grasses scattered in the area were also evident 

(Figure 2). Consequently, our results reflect the influence of 40 years of grazing, with a lower land use 

intensity in the last decade. 

At site HiP, the slope was 23.3 ± 3.2%. This site was covered by a coffee plantation until 1968. 

Afterwards, the coffee was replaced by pasture, planting U. brizantha as grass species. Since 1978, this area 

has been heavily grazed with dairy cattle, supporting a stocking rate greater than two livestock units per 

hectare, with regular application of fertilizers and other inputs. As a result, our measurements at this site 

represent the effect of 40 years of continuous grazing. 

A graphical summary of the land use history for the five land uses described previously is provided 

in Figure 3.

4.2.2. Experimental Design 

The study sites were located in a similar landscape position along the hillslope gradient and were 

selected to have the same soil type following Zwartendijk et al. [23]. In forest stands, we established four 

plots, and for the pasture sites three plots were established. Sampling the same number of plots per land 

uses was impossible due the restricted accessibility in pasture sites, resulting in 18 plots altogether (Figure 

1). For sampling vegetation and soil attributes, the size of each plot was 500 m2 (50 m long and 10 m wide), 

a total area of 2,000 m2 for each site. The size and number of plots were chosen according to similar 

investigations aimed at evaluating vegetation structure and composition in tropical forest restoration 

projects [40–42]. 

4.2.3. Vegetation Sampling 

Vegetation sampling was conducted from September to November 2017 in the RF, APR and AR 

plots. In each 500 m2 plot, we identified and sampled all living trees and shrubs with height ? 50 cm and 

diameter at breast height (DBH) &gt; 5 cm. Additionally, we installed a 200 m2 (50 m long and 4 m wide) 

subplot at the center of each plot, to identify and measure all trees and shrubs with DBH &amp;lt;5 cm and height 

? 50 cm. For all sites considered in this investigation, we measured the following vegetation attributes: (1) 

tree basal area; (2) canopy cover; (3) vegetation height; (4) tree density; and (5) species richness. These are 



58 
 

key ecological indicators, useful to evaluate vegetation structure and composition in tropical forest 

restoration projects, also, they are being recommend in Atlantic Forest monitoring protocols [42,43]. As 

suggested by Viani et al. [42], the percentage of canopy cover in each plot was measured by an adaptation 

of the line interception method [44], installing a 50 m line transect in the middle of each study plot. 

Vegetation height was measured with a 5 m measuring stick, and the remaining height of trees taller than 

this was estimated visually. As suggested by Suganuma and Durigan [40], for tree density, we analyzed: (1) 

density of trees (DBH &gt; 5 cm); and (2) density of saplings (DBH 1–5 cm). In the same way, for species 

richness, we analyzed: (1) total richness (all individual sampled); (2) overstory richness (DBH &gt; 5 cm); and 

(3) richness of saplings (DBH 1–5 cm). For all previous ecological indicators, we calculated the mean values 

per study site. In addition, for all sampled individuals we classified the species origin as: native or nonnative 

to the study region. Specifically, in the AR site, we evaluated planted tree mortality. 

4.2.4. Soil Sampling 

Soil sampling was conducted during the dry season in April 2018. In the middle of each plot, we 

installed a 50 m transect along the hillslope gradient. At intervals of 15 m, three disturbed soil samples at 0–

5 cm depth were collected. Before soil sampling, the litter and a small layer of soil (e.g., organic horizon) of 

less than 1 cm was removed. We determined the soil particle size distribution (PSD) with sand particle 

separation, the particle density (Pd) and soil organic carbon content (OC). The PSD analyses were carried 

out according to the hydrometer method [45]. Then, soil textures were classified following the USDA 

standards. The Pd was determined using the helium gas pycnometer method [46], and the OC analyses were 

performed following the Walkley–Black method [47]. In the same transects, at 7 m intervals, soil hydraulic 

measurements were conducted. In the specific case of AR site, to minimize spatial variability and possible 

induced effects by tillage, we placed the seven sampling points in the inter-plant space of planting lines. At 

each sampling point, we performed the Beerkan method [48,49]. A total of 126 Beerkan experiments were 

carried out, using a steel ring with an inner diameter of 16 cm inserted to a depth of about 1 cm into the 

soil surface. In each infiltration point, a known volume of water (150 mL) was repeatedly poured into the 

cylinder at a small height above soil surface (e.g., a few cm) and the energy of the water was dissipated with 

the hand fingers to minimize the soil disturbance. Then, the time needed for complete infiltration was 

logged. This procedure was repeated until the difference in infiltration time between two or three 

consecutives trials became negligible. Following a procedure commonly used for Beerkan method, at the 

beginning of each infiltration run, and near the steel ring, we collected one undisturbed soil core (100 cm3) 

at 0–5 cm depth to determine the bulk density (?b) and the initial volumetric soil water content (?i). Saturated 

soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) values were estimated by the Steady version of the Simplified method based 

on a Beerkan Infiltration run (SSBI method) [50]. According to previous a investigation carried out by 

Lozano-Baez et al. [28] on the same area, this method was chosen to avoid uncertainties due to a specific 

shape of the cumulative infiltration [51,52]. 



59 
 

 
 

In addition, the undisturbed soil cores were used to determine total soil porosity (Pt), soil 

microporosity (Mic) and soil macroporosity (Mac). The Pt was calculated using ?b and mean Pd of each plot 

[53]. The Mic was estimated using a tension table with application of 6 kPa suction, and Mac was obtained 

by the difference between Pt and Mic [54]. Finally, according to Lassabatere et al. [48], at the end of each 

infiltration test, a disturbed soil sample was collected to determine the saturated gravimetric water content, 

and ?b was used to calculate the saturated volumetric soil water content (?s). 

4.2.5. Data Analysis 

The hypothesis of normal distribution of both the raw and the log-transformed data was tested 

by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with raw or log-

transformed data. When ANOVA null hypothesis was rejected, we used multiple comparisons to detect 

differences between pairs by applying the Tukey’s honestly significant difference test. The related p-values 

were computed and compared to the level of significance of 0.05. Alternative non-parametric tests (Kruskal–

Wallis ANOVA) were used when even the log-transformed data were non-normally distributed. In this case, 

when ANOVA null hypothesis was rejected, multiple comparisons between pairs were made with the 

Bonferroni method (adjusted p-values). Variables means were calculated for soil attributes according to the 

statistical distribution of the data, e.g., geometric mean for log-normal distributions and arithmetic means 

for normal distributions [55]. According to Lee et al., the appropriate CV expression for a log-normal 

distribution was calculated for the geometric means, and the usual CV was calculated for the arithmetic 

means [56]. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated to identify correlation among the selected soil 

attributes: Pt, Mic, Mac, OC, ?i, ?b and Ks across all study sites. Furthermore, to compare the soil and 

vegetation attributes among land use types, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on 

standardized variables. All statistical analyses were carried out using the Minitab© computer program 

(Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). 

 

4.3. Results 

4.3.1.  Vegetation Attributes 

A total of 541 saplings and 646 trees distributed in 38 families, 92 genera, and 138 species were 

sampled. For non-native species, we found 62 saplings and 147 trees, representing 11% and 23% of the 

total, respectively (Appendix F and Appendix G). Although the basal area and vegetation height of trees 

were much higher in RF, these did not differ statistically with both restored forests. The canopy cover 

showed significant differences in AR with RF and APR. We highlight the higher similarity between RF and 

APR for density of trees and saplings (Table 1), as a result of the high density of non-native trees Psidium 

guajava and Tecoma stans, which represented 24% and 5% of trees in APR, respectively. In contrast, non-



60 
 

native trees in the RF and AR represented 18% and 16%, respectively, of all tree individuals sampled in each 

site. Additionally, the total richness, the density and richness of trees and saplings were markedly lower in 

AR, where 14% of planted trees (e.g., initial species) were dead yet there was a higher presence of grasses 

(e.g., U. brizantha) observed in all plots.

4.3.2. Soil Physical and Hydraulic Properties 

The texture of the upper layers of the soil (0–5 cm) was clay loam in APR and pasture sites, while 

it was sandy clay loam in RF and AR sites. The clay content at the study sites ranged between 21% and 44%, 

but only the RF with lower values of clay differed significantly from the other study sites. Moreover, soil 

samples taken from the HiP showed the highest clay content. The silt ranged between 18% and 37%, with 

higher silt values in APR that differed significantly from other land-covers. The sand content varied between 

31% and 55%, and was significantly lower in APR compared with other study sites (Table 2).

Comparisons of ?b values between study sites revealed higher similarity between RF and APR, 

while AR presented similar ?b values with both pasture sites. The Pd had similar values in all study sites, 

ranging from 2.61 to 2.71 g cm?3. The OC varied significantly among sites (from 4.6 to 25.6 g kg?1), with 



61 
 

 
 

higher values in HiP and markedly lower values in AR. The soil Mac ranged from 0.16 to 0.38 cm3 cm?3, 

with greater values observed in RF, followed by the APR, AR, LiP and HiP. Similar results were obtained 

for Pt, which varied from 0.48 to 0.66 cm3 cm?3. In contrast, the soil Mic (from 0.21 to 0.43 cm3 cm?3) was 

much higher in pasture sites and decreased in forest land-covers, with lower values in RF and AR. In 

addition, the ?i at the time of the Beerkan infiltration run varied between 0.12 and 0.32 cm3 cm?3, with 

significant lower values in the RF. The ?s varied between 0.29 and 0.75 cm3 cm?3 with significant lower 

values in restored forests. The Ks ranged from 4 mm h?1 to a maximum of 1,121 mm h?1 among the study 

areas. The higher Ks was evidenced in APR, which was only similar with RF and significantly different from 

other three land uses. The Ks values obtained in the RF were lower than APR. In contrast, the Ks of AR 

between 15 and 1,121 mm h?1 was similar to RF and differed significantly for the other three land uses. In 

addition, across the five land uses, Ks values varied least and differed significantly from each other at the LiP 

and HiP (Table 3).

Note. For ?b, Ks, Mic, Mac, Pt, ?i and ?s numbers of soil sample: RF = 28, APR = 28, AR = 28, LiP = 21 and HiP = 21. 

For Pd and OC number of soil samples: RF = 12, APR = 12, AR = 12, LiP = 9 and HiP = 9. Different superscript 

letters denote statistically significant differences between land use types, according to the Tukey’s test (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

Within-site plots, high variability in Ks was observed in the RF plots and within the two restored 

forest classes. In contrast, smaller variations were evidenced in pasture sites. Figure 4 includes the results of 

the of the Tukey’s test for all sampled plots. The grouping information highlights the significant and non-

significant comparisons for all sampled plots. In the first group, the forest plots evidenced not significant 

differences due to the high Ks variability within these plots (e.g., Ks means from 104 to 407 mm h–1). Then, 

the second group (RF1, RF3, RF4, AR1, AR3, LiP1 and LiP2) showed significant differences with pasture 

sites, which were grouped in a third (LiP1, LiP2, LiP3, HiP1 and HiP2) and fourth group (LiP3, HiP1, HiP2 



62 
 

and HiP3). In general, the LiP and HiP plots were similar, and mean Ks values altogether (e.g., from 8 to 47 

mm h–1) were very low (Figure 4).

According to the Pearson’s correlation coefficient among selected soil attributes across all study 

sites, significant positive correlations were found for Pt vs. Mac (0.60) and Ks vs. Mac (0.67). In contrast, 

significant negative correlations were found for ?b vs. Pt (?0.99), ?b vs. Mac (?0.58) and Ks vs. Mic (?0.49) 

(Appendix H). 

The first and second axis of the PCA for the soil attributes explained 43.0% and 29.3%, 

respectively, of the variation among all study sites. This analysis revealed a gradient of land-cover types from 

pastures to forest covers. As expected, the pasture sites were separated from the forest covers due to the 

higher Mic and ?b. Similarly, the higher ?b values in AR plots contributed to separating the study site. Then, 

APR plots were more similar to RF plots, and both forest covers were associated with higher Ks, Mac, Pt, ?i 

and OC values (Figure 5A). The PCA correlating the soil and vegetation attributes showed a clear segregation 

among forest cover sites, explaining 55.2% and 16.5% of the variation in the first and second axis, 

respectively. This analysis showed that RF plots were mainly related with larger trees, evidencing higher 

correlation with vegetation attributes such as height of trees, density of saplings, basal area, canopy cover 

and overstory richness, also it was evidenced intermediate values of Mic. Considering the vegetation 

attributes in APR plots, the PCA showed positive correlation with total richness of species, density of trees 

and richness of saplings, also positive correlation and higher values of Ks, ?i, Mac and Pt were found in these 

plots. By contrast, the separation of AR plots was driven by the higher ?b values and lower vegetation 

attributes, since AR site had a more intensive land use history compared to RF and APR sites. In particular, 

among AR plots, AR3 was the most different plot, composed by few and smaller trees growing in a 

compacted soil (Figure 5B).

4.4. Discussion 

4.4.1.  Effects of Land-Cover Type and Land Use History on Soil Physical and Hydraulic 

Properties 

Assessing the Ks recovery, soil physical and hydraulic properties of different forest restoration 

strategies, and investigating their relationships with land use history, vegetation structure and composition, 

provided the opportunity to identify the extent to which these forest restoration strategies contribute to 

supplying ecosystem functions as infiltration of rainwater. The variation of Ks among land-cover types was 

not as we expected, due to the higher Ks evidenced in APR and lower in RF. However, our results supported 

the first study hypothesis, namely that a more intensive land use history in AR resulted in a lower Ks recovery 

compared to APR. Importantly, despite both restored forest types being located in the same soil type and 

landscape position, it was not clear from our measurements whether APR resulted in a faster recovery of Ks 

compared to AR, due to the high variability in land use history. Similar situations have been reported in 

several tropical studies [26,29]. In addition, the Ks recovery in APR could be associated with improved soil 

physical and hydraulic properties, which suggest a higher soil pore connectivity. Hassler et al. [12] found 

similar Ks at 0–6 cm depth between 100-year-old and 12–15-year-old secondary forests in Panama. Similarly, 

Leite et al. [24], at Brazilian Caatinga, obtained no significant differences for surface Ks between old-growth 

forest (more than 55 years) and young secondary forest (7 years). This Ks recovery to pre-pasture levels was 

also detected at 12.5 cm depth after 15 years of pasture abandonment for an Oxisol in the Brazilian Amazon 

[11] and by other studies carried out in tropical environments [20,21]. In contrast, after 10 years of natural 



64 
 

regeneration in Ecuador, no significant changes of Ks were reported at 12.5 cm depth for an Inceptisol, 

which was related with invasive species delaying the Ks recovery [33]. 

Our Ks in the RF plots can be compared with those for Lozano-Baez et al. [28], as both 

investigations in the same forest biome estimated the Ks with the SSBI method, on the same soil texture 

(e.g., sandy clay loam) and at the same soil depth used an identical measurement technique (e.g., Beerkan 

method) and instruments. Our mean Ks in the RF (215 mm h?1) was close to reported value (387 mm h?1) 

by Lozano-Baez et al. [28] under similar soil conditions. This difference can be explained by the more 

conserved soil conditions in the study area of Lozano-Baez et al. [28], for example, as their remnant forest 

was never burned or cultivated. In contrast, our RF was partially cleared and was affected by natural fire 

disturbances. This observation is in line with several studies, which suggest that in old-growth tropical 

forests the Ks can be affected by past soil degradation and intensity of forest use [11,15,29,57]. The Ks values 

obtained in RF plots (e.g., from 23 to 1,122 mm h?1) showed the high spatial variability of the infiltration 

process under forest cover, which can be associated with the heterogeneous soil structure, lower ?b and 

higher Mac [57–59]. Another factor to consider is the spatial heterogeneity of our RF, where different 

landscape conditions such as higher slope and vegetation attributes among sample plots could have 

influenced the Ks variability. In this sense, we believe that the true reference soil condition could be 

represented by RF plot RF2, due to observed low soil disturbance in this plot, which is consistent with the 

higher tree basal area (39.4 m2 ha?1), vegetation height (average of 12.9 m), species richness (41 trees and 

non-tree; Table 1 and Appendix I), OC and soil porosity (Table 3 and Appendix J). Unfortunately, it was 

not possible to find similar forests in the study area, but we could expect that infiltration capacity in other 

Brazilian Atlantic Forest patches will be directly related with the forest age and forest conditions, which has 

been shown by several studies [12,24,60]. Therefore, the Ks values in RF could be limited by the number of 

measurements (n = 28), which should be increased in future studies, considering the gradient and spatial 

heterogeneity of forest cover. 

Our results highlight the importance of land use legacy on Ks recovery during forest restoration. 

The restoration diagnosis in APR and AR based on the “Diagnostic” protocol [37], allowed evidencing 

significant differences in the initial environmental situations (e.g., naturally regenerating native plants) and 

land use history between both sites. In fact, the initial differences in the initial environmental situations in 

each restored site allowed the restoration practitioners to identify and select at the beginning of the 

restoration project the most suitable restoration strategy. Figure 3 provides a graphical summary of these 

differences between APR and AR. Our findings are also in agreement with other studies that reported lower 

Ks when land use was more intense prior to forest regrowth [11,21,27]. In this sense, our AR site with a 

more intensive land use history, resulted in significant lower Ks, which could be attributed mainly to greater 

soil exposure and soil compaction during the land use history. Our mean Ks in the AR site (163 mm h?1) 

was considerably higher than the reported value (54 mm h?1) by Lozano-Baez et al. [28] on the same soil 

texture (e.g., sandy clay loam). This difference can be explained by the higher ?b values found in the actively 

restored forest of Lozano-Baez et al. [28]. 



65 
 

 
 

Despite no statistically significant differences being found between AR and other forest plots, we 

stress that the specific past land use intensity and management in each plot could also have played an 

important role in soil degradation. Thus, we found AR plots (AR1 and AR3), where the Ks values were 

below the mean of other forest plots. The lower Ks in these plots are consistent with their higher ?b and Mic, 

lower Mac and OC (Appendix J) and possibly a more intensive past management, suggesting that these plots 

still retain the “memory” from the previous land use. Similar results have been reported by Bonell et al. [26], 

for a 10-year-old Acacia plantation in India growing in Ultisols and Oxisols, with lower Ks when compared 

to less disturbed forests. On the other hand, the higher Ks in restored plots AR2 and AR4 is closer to the 

RF and APR plots, indicating that in some cases after 11 years the active restoration could reach the 

infiltration recovery target defined by the reference conditions. This finding agrees with recent literature 

reviews, which show that Ks recovery after tree planting in the tropics occur across a wide range of soil 

conditions [61,62] and probably after more than one decade [26,33]. In addition, it is important to 

underscore that before tree planting at AR site, trampling pressure occurred for 13 years over abandoned 

agricultural terraces, causing terracing failure. Several previous studies have reported an increase in soil loss, 

surface runoff, ?b and reduction of infiltration rates after terrace abandoning [63,64]. Another important 

factor that might have influenced the current Ks in AR site is the possible soil compaction during soil 

preparation, tree planting using bulldozers or tractors is associated with high levels of soil disturbance, and 

the effects of this soil preparation can persist long after tree planting [65]. Overall, these circumstances 

suggest that initial soil conditions before forest restoration actions at AR site were more degraded than in 

APR. Nevertheless, in our study the lack of soil measurements in each moment of the land use history 

precludes a stronger understanding of the relative impacts of historical land management on Ks recovery, 

thus future studies should consider the role of previous land use, comparing sites with a truly identical 

history. 

The significantly lower Ks observed in pasture sites compared to forest land-cover types was 

consistent with several previous studies [20,33,66], supporting the importance of preserving the forest cover 

and promoting forest restoration actions in the landscape to maintain the infiltration process. This result 

can be attributed to higher ?b and Mic in both pasture sites (Table 3). In the present study, we observed a 

significant higher Ks in the LiP compared to HiP. The differences in Ks between LiP and HiP are mainly 

related to factors such as cattle-grazing intensity and the duration of pasture cover, which has been similarly 

reported in several other tropical studies [11,12,66]. Additionally, the similar OC between pasture sites and 

forest covers (RF and APR) is a trend that has been previously noted by other authors [9,22,28,67], 

suggesting that such similarities are linked to the accumulation of organic matter by the root system of 

grasses, the animal-derived inputs and application of fertilizers. 

4.4.2.  Relationships between Soil, Vegetation and Land Use History 

When evaluating vegetation attributes in forest cover sites, our study revealed the significantly 

lower values in AR and higher values in RF. The higher values of vegetation attributes in the RF could be 



66 
 

explained as a consequence of the longer time that this old-growth forest (Figure 3) has remained 

undisturbed [68,69]. It is interesting to note that basal area and vegetation height of trees in AR could reach 

statistically similar values to the RF. Similarly, Garcia et al. [70] found in the same biome no significant 

differences in the basal area between actively restored forests (12, 23 and 55 years old) and the reference 

condition. Furthermore, it is noteworthy in AR that, while Ks, basal area and vegetation height of trees have 

reached statistically similar values with the RF, other vegetation attributes, such as canopy cover, tree density 

and species richness, were significantly lower than those for the RF plots. For instance, the lower canopy 

cover, density and richness of saplings (e.g., lack of regenerating trees) in AR might compromise the future 

forest structure [68], which could hamper the recovery of soil hydraulic properties [62]. Although the 

herbaceous cover was not directly quantified, we observed a higher abundance of grasses (e.g., U. brizantha) 

in AR site, which could be related to the lower canopy cover. The open canopy conditions in AR may have 

favored the persistence of grasses, hindering the recruitment of new trees species [71]. In contrast, APR site 

had statistically similar Ks (Figure 4) and vegetation attributes to the RF (Table 1). However, the vegetation 

attributes in APR were mainly influenced by non-native trees, such as P. guajava, an aggressive pioneer 

species with allelopathic potential [72]. For these reasons, we suggest that both restored forests need 

management activities to improve soil and vegetation attributes. Canopy cover protects the soil from 

physical disturbance, and higher species richness and tree density with native species can produce a higher 

biomass and enhance the Ks [73,74]. 

One possible explanation for the different outputs between AR and APR are the initial soil 

conditions at each site. As mentioned above, when the forest restoration actions began in APR, the soil 

might have had better initial conditions (lower ?b, higher Ks, OC and soil porosity), and some degree of 

natural regeneration, which stimulated the potential recovery of the site and facilitating the recruitment of 

new trees species [3,37]. In AR site, the more intensive land use history probably led to an area with low 

resilience, a more compacted soil and poor OC. In particular, the intensity of past land use has been reported 

as the main factor affecting tropical forest recovery, for example, the vegetation in pastures with a long-

lasting land use will regenerate more slowly relative to pastures used less intensively [75,76]. Both restoration 

approaches (APR and AR) have an important role in the process of restoring degraded ecosystems in 

tropical landscapes and can be used complementary to enhance the chances of restoration success [37,68]. 

To understand the soil hydraulic recovery after forest restoration, it is important that future studies consider 

the role of the duration and intensity of the previous land use, including parameters to assess the land use 

legacy effects [11,77] and more measurements over time in deeper soil layers, which may reveal further 

differences among restoration strategies. 

The correlation results for Pt vs. Mac and Ks vs. Mac are in agreement with several other studies in 

the Atlantic Forest [30,58], which reported the positive influence of Mac for the pore space and infiltration 

process. This finding is consistent with the inverse relationships between Ks vs. ?b, Ks vs. Mic and Mac vs. ?b, 

also found by some studies [9,23,28,78]. High OC contributes to the trend of increasing Ks, soil porosity and 

reducing ?b values [9]. However, the reverse occurred in the present study, which can be attributed to the 

high OC and ?b in pastures sites as well as low OC in AR but with a high Ks, suggesting that recovery of soil 



67 
 

 
 

physical and hydraulic properties is not only dependent on the OC. The result of the PCA indicate the 

importance of forest cover to promote the infiltration and better soil physical and hydraulic properties. This 

could be associated with the litter inputs, roots and higher soil faunal activity produced by the trees, which 

can influence positively the aggregate stability, Mac and OC, thereby Ks increase in forest covers [79,80]. 

Nevertheless, there is a need to further research the plant–soil interactions; for example, little attention has 

been paid to the effects of individual trees, richness and density of species on Ks and soil hydraulic properties 

[80]. 

 

4.5. Conclusions 

The Ks recovery differed between AR and APR sites. As we expected, the knowledge of the land 

use history was crucial for understanding the current differences among the study sites for Ks, soil physical 

and hydraulic properties. This is consistent with our previous work [28] in the same forest restoration 

program. The Ks and vegetation attributes decreased when land use was more intense prior to forest 

restoration actions. The influence of land use intensity on soil physical and hydraulic properties could also 

be evidenced in the comparison between LiP and HiP. The present results further illustrate the positive 

correlation between Ks and vegetation attributes (tree basal area, vegetation height of trees and overstory 

richness) in forests undergoing restoration.

5. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Although the importance of soil for forest restoration has been pointed by several studies, it is 

clear that soil is still regarded as a “black box” by restoration practitioners around the world. In line with 

previous studies and to continue opening this “black box”, our work contributed to understand the effects 

of forest restoration on the recovery of soil physical and hydraulic properties, more specifically on water 

infiltration. In the first part of the study (Chapter 2), with a systematic review of scientific literature, we 

showed that infiltration was likely to increase in many tropical forests restored by tree planting; that 

infiltration recovery could be faster when the agriculture was the prior land use; that clayey soils (&gt;30% 

clay) trended to exhibit greater increases in infiltration after tree planting; and that restored forests after 10 

years evidenced more similar infiltration values with the pre-disturbance soil conditions. In the second part 

(Chapter 3), our study was carried out in a study area with great soil variability. To overcome this soil 

variability, we compared sites with similar soil textural classes in the surface horizon. In this context, our 

results showed two actively restored forests with marked differences in soil physical and hydraulic 

properties. In the first situation, the soil recovery could reach similar values to the pre-disturbance soil 

conditions. In the second situation, the soil recovery was not evidenced, and soil attributes were similar to 

pasture sites. Consequently, the hypothesis that forest restoration can recover the surface Ks to the pre-

disturbance soil conditions was not supported for both restored forest sites. In addition, the different soil 

responses in both restored forests could be related to many factors (e.g., topographic variations, soil texture, 

land use history, density and diversity of plants, among others). In order to understand and interpret 

adequately the influence of these factor on soil physical and hydraulic properties after forest restoration, in 

the last part (Chapter 4), a more rigorous experiment was designed to capture the least possible soil variation. 

In this part, we also compared the soil and vegetation recovery of active vs. assisted passive restoration 

strategies. As we expected, the active restoration site with a more intensive land use history, evidenced lower 

Ks recovery, soil and vegetation attributes. Our findings also indicated the positive correlation between Ks 

and vegetation attributes. In this respect it is important to highlight the role of vegetation attributes used in 

Atlantic Forest monitoring protocols, these vegetation attributes could reflect the good or poor soil 

conditions in forests undergoing restoration. 

Based on the research findings of this thesis, we concluded that forest restoration actions may 

improve soil physical and hydraulic properties, but in some cases a complete recovery to reference levels 

can be difficult, especially when land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions. Thus, we 

suggest that management activities should be implemented before and during forest restoration to avoid 

soil compaction and guarantee the soil recovery. Results reported here also indicated that pasture land use 

affects drastically the soil physical and hydraulic properties, therefore, it is highly recommended to 

implement best land management practices (e.g., rotational grazing and introduction of silvopastoral 

systems) to avoid the negative effects on the pastures. Our results have shown that more studies are needed 

to understand how infiltration and soil recovery occurs in both actively and passively restored forests. It 



76 
 

would be very interesting to study the soil recovery in forest undergoing restoration on different climates, 

forests and soils types. In this sense, there are important challenges to be addressed, for example, assessing 

the water movement through the soil profile. Most studies have focused on top-soil, and only few 

investigations have analyzed the effect of forest restoration on deeper soil layers. Other research priority is 

to determine the rates and extents, which forest restoration is recovery the infiltration process. In this regard, 

it is important to highlight that most research is focusing in young restored forest for measuring soil physical 

and hydraulic properties, if these results are extrapolated could create misleading conclusions, thus long-

term studies with replication in time (e.g., undergoing restoration forests with different ages) are also 

necessary. Considering that hydrological processes occur in the landscape, it would be relevant upscaling 

the infiltration plot measurements to catchment level and investigating the relationships with other 

hydrological processes (e.g., groundwater recharge, surface runoff, evaporation among other). Future 

researches are also needed to understand the effects of individual trees, richness and density of species on 

soil physical and hydraulic properties. Finally, the role that water infiltration can have for the water quality 

deserve more attention.
