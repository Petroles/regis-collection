Abstract 

To support the current debate and actions to be taken about climatic consequences of 

anthropogenic release of CO2, a refined understanding about past climatic and oceanographic 

changes is necessary. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a 

fundamental role in the oceanography and climate of the Atlantic realm, directly controlling 

stratification and distribution of water masses, the amount of heat that is transported by the 

ocean, and the cycling and storage of chemical species, such as carbon dioxide in the deep 

sea. The formation and circulation of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is an important 

component of the upper branch of the AMOC, involved in the transport of heat and salt within 

the Southern Hemisphere subtropical gyre and driving high–low latitude climatic 

teleconnections. Reconstructing intermediate water properties is, therefore, important for 

understanding feedbacks within the ocean-climate system. However, information on AAIW 

evolution remains limited. AMOC oscillations and changes in heat distribution have strong 

implications for the South American climate, influencing moisture influx availability for the 

South American Summer Monsoon (SASM), via sea surface temperatures and Intertropical 

Convergence Zone positioning. Here we reconstruct AAIW isotopic signature during marine 

isotope stages 2 and 3 (41-12 cal kyr BP) using carbon and oxygen isotopes from benthic 

foraminifera (Cibicidoides and Uvigerina genera) of a radiocarbon dated marine sediment 

core (1100m water depth and 20?S, off the Brazilian coast). We find that AAIW’s physical 

and chemical properties changed Heinrich stadials 3 and 4, probably as a consequence of 

AMOC decreased strength during these periods.  We also reconstruct Last Glacial Maximum 

and deglacial (23-12 cal kyr BP) continental conditions over eastern Brazil based on Ti/Ca of 

our marine sediment core as a proxy for Doce River (draining eastern Brazil) terrigenous 

input. Most of the rainfall in the Doce River Basin is related to the activity of the SASM. Our 

Ti/Ca record together with a speleothem ?18O composite from Lapa Sem Fim Cave, also in 

eastern Brazil, suggests a major decrease in precipitation during the Bølling–Allerød 

interstadial, likely related to a weakening of the SASM. We further compared our Ti/Ca 

results with the output of the SYNTRACE run of the CCSM3 fully-coupled climate model 

with transient forcing for the last deglaciation. Geochemical records and model output show 

consistent results and suggest that eastern South America experienced the driest period of the 

whole last deglaciation during the Bølling–Allerød and that this dry spell was likely related to 

decreased SAMS intensity.

Resumo 

Para dar suporte ao atual debate sobre as consequências climáticas da liberação 

antropogênica de CO2 na atmosfera, o refinamento do conhecimento sobre mudanças 

climáticas e oceanográficas no passado é necessário. A Circulação de Revolvimento 

Meridional do Atlântico (CRMA) tem papel fundamental na oceanografia e clima das áreas 

sob influência do Oceano Atlântico, controlando diretamente a estratificação e distribuição de 

massas d’água, a quantidade de calor transportada pelo oceano e os ciclo e armazenamento de 

compostos químicos, como o CO2 em mar profundo. A formação e circulação da Água 

Intermediária Antártica (AIA), envolvida no transporte de calor e sal para o giro subtropical 

do Hemisfério Sul e nas teleconexões climáticas entre altas e baixas latitudes, é componente 

importante do ramo superior da CRMA. A reconstrução de propriedades de massas de água 

intermediárias é, portanto, importante para a compreensão dos sistemas de retroalimentação 

entre oceano-clima. No entanto, informações quanto a evolução da AIA continuam limitadas. 

Oscilações da CRMA e consequentes mudanças na distribuição de calor tem implicações 

importantes para o clima Sul Americano, influenciando a disponibilidade de umidade para o 

Sistema de Monções Sul Americano (SMSA), via temperatura da superfície marinha e 

posicionamento da Zona de Convergência Intertropical. Neste trabalho nós reconstruímos a 

assinatura isotópica da AIA durante os estágios isotópicos marinhos 2 e 3 (41-12 cal ka AP) 

usando isótopos de carbono e oxigênio de foraminíferos bentônicos (gêneros Cibicidoides e 

Uvigerina) de um testemunho de sedimentos marinhos datados por radiocarbono (1100 m de 

profundidade e a 20?S na costa do Brasil). Concluímos que propriedades físicas e químicas da 

AIA mudaram durante os estadiais Heinrich 3 e 4, provavelmente como consequência de 

enfraquecimento da CRMA durante estes períodos. Também reconstruímos as condições 

continentais do leste brasileiro entre o último máximo glacial e a deglaciação (23-12 cal ka 

AP) baseadas em razões Ti/Ca de nosso testemunho de sedimentos marinhos como 

indicadoras de aporte terrígeno do Rio Doce. A maior parte da chuva que cai na Bacia do Rio 

Doce está relacionada a atividade do SMAS. Nosso registro de Ti/Ca em conjunto com ?18O 

de espeleotemas da Caverna Lapa Sem Fim, também no leste do Brasil, sugere diminuição 

marcante da chuva durante o interestadial Bølling–Allerød, provavelmente relacionada a 

enfraquecimento do SMAS. Ademais comparamos as razões de Ti/Ca com dados de saída da 

rodada SYNTRACE do modelo climático CCSM3 com forçantes transientes para a última 

deglaciação. Os registros geoquímicos e a saída do modelo mostram resultados consistentes 

entre si e sugerem que o leste da América do Sul passou pelo seu período mais seco de toda a 

última deglaciação durante o interestadial Bølling–Allerød, provavelmente relacionado ao 

enfraquecimento do SMAS.

1. Introduction and objectives / Introdução e objetivos 

 Introduction / Introdução 

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a fundamental role in 

the oceanography and climate of the Atlantic realm. As such, AMOC activity directly controls 

stratification and distribution of water masses, the amount of heat that is transported by the 

ocean, and the cycling and storage of chemical species, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the 

deep sea (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007). Past changes in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations over 

interglacial and glacial cycles may have been driven by changes in ventilation and circulation 

of intermediate and deep waters (e.g., Siegenthaler and Wenk, 1984).  

The formation and circulation of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is an important 

component of the upper branch of the AMOC, involved in the transport of heat and salt within 

the Southern Hemisphere (SH) subtropical gyre (Talley, 1996). Upon its formation on the 

Subantarctic Frontal Zone, AAIW sequesters significant quantities of CO2 (Talley, 1996; 

Sabine et al., 2004), which are then widely distributed in SH oceans (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 

1994). Reconstructing intermediate water properties is, therefore, important for understanding 

feedbacks within the ocean-climate system. However, information on intermediate water mass 

evolution remains limited (Elmore et al., 2015). 

The South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) is one of the major monsoon systems 

in the SH and the most important climatic feature in South America (SA; Vera et al., 2006; 

Carvalho et al., 2012). Its strength is dependent on insolation with moisture availability 

modulated by Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) positioning (Vera et al., 2006). Given 

that the former is controlled by sea surface temperatures (SST; Nobre and Shukla, 1996), 

AMOC oscillations and changes in heat distribution have strong implications for the South 

American climate.  

Deglaciation periods offer the possibility to study in detail the impact of rapid climatic 

changes on the environment (Wohlfarth, 1996). The last deglaciation, or Termination I, 

started between 20 and 18 kyr ago in the SH with continuous increase in temperature and 

greenhouse gas concentration (Petit et al., 1999; Marcott et al., 2014). For over 3 kyr 

Antarctica warmed while Greenland and the North Atlantic remained cold. The Northern

Hemisphere (NH) cold period between 18.1 and 14.7, known as Heinrich stadial 1 (HS1), 

ended abruptly at the start of the Bølling–Allerød interstadial (Rasmussen et al., 2006). This 

abrupt transition was marked by the restart of the AMOC (McManus et al., 2004) and 

warming in NH (Petit et al., 1999), with a corresponding return to cold conditions in the south 

(Blunier et al., 1997). 

Previous studies have correlated pulses of terrigenous input with cold events in the NH 

off the coast of generally dry northeastern SA (Arz et al., 1998; Arz et al., 1999; Jennerjahn et 

al., 2004; Jaeschke et al., 2007; Nace et al., 2014). Yet, the 23-7ºS sector of the Brazilian 

continental margin remains completely void of studies. This is a particularly relevant sector of 

the continental margin for reconstructing the strength of the SASM. Oxygen isotopic 

oscillations from stalagmites have provided a glimpse of how continental climate responded 

to past millennial scale abrupt events (Wang et al., 2008a; Stríkis et al., 2015). However the 

several other areas of the continent and proximal marine environments are still not resolved.  

The mere possibility that the AMOC could change was already a strong motivator to 

understand how it may have oscillated in the past (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007). A recent 

study confirmed that the AMOC is currently weakening (Rahmstorf et al., 2015), highlighting 

the urgency of researching about the impacts of past AMOC strength oscillations and abrupt 

climatic events during the glacial and deglacial periods.  

 Objectives / Objetivos 

The main objectives of this dissertation are: 

(i) Investigate the isotopic evolution of southern sourced water masses (i.e., AAIW, 

UCDW and their glacial correspondents) in the western tropical South Atlantic throughout the 

last glacial and Termination I, and suggest its driving mechanisms; 

(ii) Determine changes in major elements of sediments from the western tropical South 

Atlantic throughout the last glacial and Termination I, and suggest its driving mechanisms;

2.1.1. The modern Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation / A Célula de 

Revolvimento Meridional do Atlântico no presente 

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), correspondent to the 

Atlantic section of the global termohaline circulation, plays a fundamental role in the 

oceanography and climate of the Atlantic realm. The ocean affects climate through its high 

heat capacity relative to the surrounding land, thereby moderating daily, seasonal and 

interannual temperature fluctuations, and through its ability to transport large amounts of heat 

polewards, whereas freshwater input to high latitudes and low-latitude evaporation tend to 

brake this flow (Clark et al., 2002). The AMOC is responsible for much of the total oceanic 

poleward heat transport in the Atlantic, peaking at about 1.2 ± 0.3 PW (1 PW equals 1015 

Watts) at 24ºN (Ganachaud and Wunsch, 2000). The northward-flowing Atlantic surface 

waters are warm, whereas the southward-flowing deep waters are cold defining a meridional 

heat flux and a net northward transport of heat (Figure 2.1). 

The AMOC activity directly controls stratification and distribution of water masses, the 

amount of heat that is transported by the ocean, and the cycling and storage of chemical 

species, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the deep sea (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007). It can be 

divided in four main branches: upwelling processes bringing older water from depth to near 

the ocean surface, surface currents that transport relatively light warm waters toward high 

latitudes, deepwater formation regions where waters become denser and sink, and deep 

currents closing the loop. These four branches span the entire Atlantic on both hemispheres, 

forming a circulation system that consists of two overturning cells, a deep one with North 

Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and an abyssal one with Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW; 

Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007).

Warm and saline waters from the Southern Subtropical Gyre (SSG), with contribution 

of the waters brought by the Agulhas Current from the Indian Ocean, cross the Equator via 

the North Brazil Current (NBC), and ultimately contribute to the northward flowing Gulf 

Stream. At high latitudes of the North Atlantic, these high salinity surface and intermediate 

waters lose buoyancy as they transmit heat to the atmosphere and sink forming the southward 

flowing NADW. 

Deep-water formation in the Southern Ocean occurs along the Antarctic continental 

shelf in the Weddell and Ross Seas either through intense evaporation or, more typically, 

through brine rejection that produces dense waters that sink along the slope (Killworth, 1983). 

As a result, the North Atlantic surface is relatively warmer and saltier than its equivalent 

in the South Atlantic. South of the Equator, the nutrient poor NADW occupies from 1500 to 

4000 m water depth and lies within the density range of the northward flowing Circumpolar 

Deep Water (CDW). The latter is then divided in two layers: Upper Circumpolar Deep Water 

(UCDW) and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW), each of them less saline, richer in 

nutrients and lower in oxygen than NADW (Reid et al., 1977; Figure 2.2). UCDW is defined 

as a local oxygen and temperature minimum located below the salinity minimum and local 

oxygen maximum characteristic of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW; Tsuchiya and 

Talley, 1994). Under LCDW, AABW bathes the South Atlantic sea floor below 4000 m with 

cold and nutrient rich waters (Figure 2.2).

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) corresponds to a tropical belt of minimum 

pressure and deep convergence of the trade winds from both hemispheres over the equatorial 

oceans (Figure 2.3). It migrates seasonally towards the hemisphere being warmed in 

relationship to the other, shifting latitudinally in response to zonal sea surface temperatures 

(SST) gradients, which itself contributes to the distribution of sea level pressure and winds

(Nobre and Shukla, 1996; Chiang and Kushnir, 2002; Schneider et al., 2014). The Atlantic 

section of the ITCZ migrates seasonally reaching its northernmost location, 10°N, in August 

and southernmost, 1°S, in March (mean latitudes at longitude 30°W; Nobre and Shukla, 

1996). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that during abrupt cooling events on the Northern 

Hemisphere (NH) it migrated further southward of the Equator (e.g., Deplazes et al., 2013).  

The South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) has its onset in October, when 

moisture influx to the Amazon Basin from the Atlantic Ocean is intensified due to increased 

thermal gradients between land and sea, stronger trade winds, and the southward shift on the 

ITCZ position (Vera et al., 2006). Efficient transport of humidity from the Tropical Atlantic 

into South America (SA), reaches the Amazon Basin, where intense convective activity takes 

place. 

The SASM most active phase is between December and February (austral summer), 

when a deep continental low forms over the Chaco region (due to insolation increase in the 

Southern Hemisphere, around 25°S; Seluchi et al., 2003) and forces the easterly winds over 

the Amazon basin to turn southward, channeled via Low Level Jets (LLJ) between the eastern 

slope of the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau (Garreaud et al., 2009). During this peak phase, a 

prominent warm-core anticyclone establishes itself over the elevated Altiplano of the central 

Andes, the Bolivian High (BH), defined by Lenters and Cook (1997) as “a collective response 

to precipitation in the Amazon, central Andes, and South Atlantic Convergence Zone 

(SACZ), with its position over the Altiplano being largely the result of Amazonian 

precipitation”. The latent heat release over the Amazon Basin and the establishment of the BH 

are also connected to the development of SACZ, a transient convective system characterized 

by a NW-SE nebulosity band formed by transport of Amazon moisture via LLJ to 

southeastern SA (Figure 2.3) and the Atlantic (Liebmann et al., 1999; Carvalho et al., 2004; 

Vera et al., 2006). The intensity of the SASM is mainly influenced by insolation, which is 

modulated by precession and excentricity, and by the dynamics of the ITCZ. Higher (lower) 

austral summer insolation over the Southern Hemisphere (SH) strengthens (weakens) the 

monsoon system by increasing (decreasing) the land-sea thermal gradient. On the other hand, 

the ITCZ position modulates the amount of humidity influx to the Amazon Basin and 

southeastern SA. The SASM has its demise in April (Marengo et al., 2001; Raia and 

Cavalcanti, 2008).

During the austral winter, central SA (including southern Amazonia) experiences the 

dry season with maximum continental rainfall occurring to the north of the equator. Further 

south, precipitation is associated with moisture brought by extratropical cyclones and cold 

fronts (Garreaud et al., 2009).  

The SACZ is evident year round but more intense during austral summer (the SASM 

season), when it is connected with the area of convection over the central part of the 

continent, producing episodes of intense rainfall over much of southeastern SA (Liebmann et 

al., 1999). Warm anomalies in SST in subtropical South Atlantic are associated with 

southward displacement of the SACZ with contributes to increase precipitation over 

southeastern SA (Diaz et al., 1998; Barros et al., 2000).

2.2.1. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation oscillations during the Last Glacial 

Maximum and Termination I / Oscilações da Célula de Revolvimento Meridional do 

Atlântico durante o Último Máximo Glacial e a Terminação I 

Extreme, abrupt climate oscillations during the last glacial cycle were modulated by 

changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric forcing (Rahmstorf, 2002). Data and models 

both suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes 

in the AMOC in response to changes in the hydrological cycle or freshwater input in the high 

latitudes of the NH. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then 

transmitted globally through a number of feedbacks (Clark et al., 2002). 

Although theoretical studies and ocean general circulation model experiments suggest 

that the AMOC may have multiple equilibria, paleoceanographic studies focus on three 

AMOC states or modi, characterized during specific timings as the Last Glacial Maximum 

(LGM, 19-23 cal kyr BP; Mix et al., 2001), the last deglaciation and modern times (Alley and 

Clark, 1999). There’s agreement on that transitions between the equilibria states were 

triggered and/or associated to anomalies in the freshwater fluxes at the sea surface (Lynch-

Stieglitz et al., 2007). 



 
 
 
 

9 

The existence of different AMOC states in the past has been first proposed and 

discussed mostly on the basis of nutrient tracers such as ?13C (Sarnthein et al., 1994), that are 

inversely correlated to nutrient content and Cd/Ca in tests of benthic foraminifera (see section 

4.2.4). Like the major nutrients, Cd is taken up by organisms at the sea surface and released at 

depth as the organic material is decomposed. The agreement between reconstructions based 

on these two water-mass tracers provides increased confidence in the overall picture.  

Deep and vigorous overturning circulation, similar to the modern state, has persisted for 

most of the last glacial cycle, dominating the oceanic circulation in the Atlantic (Böhm et al., 

2015). During deep glacial conditions (mainly glacial maxima), however, the upper cell of the 

AMOC may have been weaker and southern-sourced waters (SSW) advanced northwards and 

upwards in the water column, while NADW sank to depths of less than 2.500 m (Labeyrie et 

al., 1992). With the decrease of NADW formation, such as during the LGM, high nutrient/low 

?13C waters, like the modern SSW (i.e., AAIW, CDW and AABW) may have partially 

replaced nutrient poor NADW and a large part of the deep Atlantic Ocean was bathed by deep 

waters advected from the Southern Ocean (Duplessy et al., 1984; Curry and Oppo, 2005; 

Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007). This shallower NADW is generally termed Glacial North 

Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) in paleoceanographic studies.  

More significant slowdowns of the AMOC, probably related to iceberg discharges and 

increased freshwater input at the high latitudes of the NH, happened during Heinrich Stadials 

(HS; Böhm et al., 2015). The Heinrich-like mode of the AMOC is characterized as a quasi-

halt in NADW formation during HS1, for instance (Rahmstorf, 2002; McManus et al., 2004). 

In contrast, the AMOC remained active during Dansgaard-Oeschger Interstadials (DO), 

abrupt warm events in the NH defined in ice cores from Greenland (Böhm et al., 2015).  

Furthermore, McManus et al. (2004) used measurements of 231Pa/230Th to trace the 

strength of the AMOC since the LGM and confirmed that the AMOC was nearly, or 

completely, eliminated during cold abrupt deglacial intervals in the North Atlantic region, 

namely HS1 and the Younger Dryas (YD; Figure 2.4).  

In the South Atlantic, low ?13C values (correlated with glacial SSW or more specifically 

the glacial correspondents of AAIW, i.e., GAAIW, and UCDW, in this case) have been 

documented between ~1600 and 2500 m in the western side of the basin (Tessin and Lund, 

2013), and above 1800 m in the tropical Atlantic (Zahn and Stüber, 2002; Lynch-Stieglitz et 



 
 
 
 

10 

al., 2014), early in the deglaciation. While a few studies suggested that greater northward 

advection of GAAIW during HS1 caused low ?13C at relatively shallow depths (Rickaby et 

al., 2005; Pahnke et al., 2008), more recent studies using cores from modern AAIW depths 

suggest that the northward extent of GAAIW decreased during HS1 and the YD, presumably 

in response to a reduced AMOC (Xie et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2014).  

It is still not clear if the AMOC has always controlled or at times only responded to 

abrupt climatic oscillations during the last glacial period (Böhm et al., 2015). Nevertheless, 

ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the major warm phases of the Greenland DO 

cycles and vice versa (Blunier and Brook, 2001; EPICA Community Members, 2006), 

supporting the idea of an interhemispheric redistribution of heat (bipolar seesaw; EPICA 

Community Members, 2006; Barker et al., 2009). WAIS Divide Project Members (2015) 

results demonstrated north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, propagated to 

the SH high latitudes by oceanic processes (abrupt Greenland warming led Antarctic cooling 

onset by 218 ± 92 years for D–O events, including the Bølling event, and Greenland cooling 

led onset of Antarctic warming by 208 ± 96 years).

2.2.2. Water masses on the Brazil continental margin during the Last Glacial 

Maximum / Massas de água na margem continental do Brasil durante o Último 

Máximo Glacial 

Along the Brazil Margin, South Atlantic ?13C values were much lower than North 

Atlantic values at nearly every water depth during the LGM. Curry and Oppo (2005) updated 

the glacial western Atlantic cross section published by Duplessy et al. (1988) and indicated 

that above 2000 m, the bathymetric ?13C gradients in the South Atlantic revealed the presence 

of two main water masses (Figure 2.5). The shallower, between 800 and 1200 m and centered 

at 1000 m water depth, was most likely sourced in the Southern Ocean and was interpreted as 

the glacial equivalent of AAIW (GAAIW). Centered at 1500 m and derived from the north 

there was another mid depth water mass, interpreted as the southern expression of GNAIW.

ocean (GEOSECS) and during the Last Glacial Maximum. Extracted from Curry and 

Oppo, 2005.   



 
 
 
 

12 

Still according to Curry and Oppo (2005), at 27ºS and during the LGM, GAAIW had a 

?13C value of about 0.3–0.5‰. Oppo and Horowitz (2000) had already identified this water 

mass as similar to AAIW but without the relatively high ?13C value caused by air-sea 

exchange.  

GNAIW originated in the North Atlantic with a ?13C value of about 1.5‰ and reached 

the Brazil Margin with ?13C values of &gt;0.8‰. Its much lower ?13C value in the South Atlantic 

implies that GNAIW underwent significant aging along its flow path or its ?13C value resulted 

from mixing with a water mass of lower ?13C.  

Curry and Oppo (2005) reported LGM AABW as the third main water mass in the 

South Atlantic (below GNAIW), flowing from the deep Southern Ocean and originating with 

an end-member ?13C value of -0.2‰ and possibly as low as -0.9% (Ninnemann and Charles, 

2002). 

2.2.3. Millenial scale climate oscillations during late glacial and Termination I / 

Oscilações climáticas de escala milenar durante a porção final do último período 

glacial e a Terminação I 

The last glacial period exhibited abrupt climatic oscillations which were primarily 

defined in the NH through ?18O analysis of ice cores from the Greenland Ice Sheet (Greenland 

Ice Core Project and Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2, GRIP and GISP2, respectively; Langway 

et al., 1985; Grootes and Stuiver, 1997; Figure 2.6). These abrupt warm events were termed 

Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO). Cold events, defined by concentration of Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) 

–rich layers within marine sediment cores from the high latitudes of the North Atlantic were 

termed Heinrich (Bond et al., 1992). 

Later on, Peterson et al. (2000), for instance, showed that the abrupt changes described 

for the high latitudes of the NH were also recorded in the tropics. They based their 

conclusions in a 90,000-year sediment record from the anoxic Cariaco Basin off the coast of 

northern Venezuela (Figure 2.6). Variations in the terrigenous input to Cariaco Basin reflected 

changes in the hydrological cycle related to the Atlantic ITCZ, which resulted in color 

reflectance variations. Within dating uncertainty, the Cariaco record matches the abrupt 

climate change showed in the Greenland ice cores. Another record, ?18O obtained from 

stalagmites from Hulu Cave in China (Figure 2.6), also exhibited strong resemblance to the 



 
 
 
 

13 

Greenland ?18O record, showing all major Greenland DOs (Wang et al., 2001). These records 

suggested a strong and fast linkage between the high-latitude North Atlantic temperatures 

with rainfall in the Atlantic ITCZ and Asian monsoon regions.  

Heinrich Stadials impacted continental tropical climates mainly through changes in 

intensity of monsoon systems. In SA, during these events, a significant decrease in North 

Atlantic SST shifted the ITCZ location southwards, strengthening the SASM (Wang et al., 

2004). In the NH, the same southward shift of the ITCZ associated with an expansion of the 

Siberian extratropical anticyclone reduced the Asian Monsoon intensity (Wang et al., 2001; 

Wang et al., 2008b).

between Greenland temperatures and rainfall records from the tropical Atlantic and China during the last 

glacial period. (a) Greenland temperatures during the last glacial period, as recorded by ?18O from the

A modeling study by Chiang et al. (2003) highlighted the sensitivity of the Atlantic 

ITCZ position during the last glacial to changes in both land ice and sea ice extent. Together, 

modeling efforts are consistent with the hypothesis that AMOC variations, and their effect on 

heat transport, hemispheric SST patterns, and ITCZ position, can be invoked to explain the 

strong covariation observed between Greenland and Cariaco Basin proxy records (Hughen et 

al., 1996; Peterson et al., 2000; Chiang and Friedman, 2012).  

In Brazil, the first studies on the impact of millennial abrupt events were (Arz et al., 

1998; Arz et al., 1999), based in terrigenous input and planktonic foraminifera ?18O off NE 

Brazil. They showed increased terrigenous input during Heinrich events due to a southward 

shift of the ITCZ. Within the continent, series of ?18O from stalagmites confirmed the 

antiphase correlation between the intensity of the Asian and South American monsoon 

systems, demonstrated that stalagmite growth in caves of northeastern Brazil occurred only 

during wet phases synchronous with Heinrich events (Wang et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007) 

and related negative ?18O excursions with SAMS intensification in speleothems from caves in 

southeastern SA (Cruz et al., 2005a; Cruz et al., 2005b; Cruz et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007). 

Other factors controlling regional paleoclimatic changes included latitudinal variations in the 

AMOC (Wang et al., 2007; Cruz et al., 2009). 

2.2.4. The Bølling - Allerød Interstadial/ O interestadial Bølling-Allerød 

The historical and widely employed nomenclature for the main climatic events that 

occurred during Termination I include (from oldest to youngest; Mangerud et al., 1974) the 

Oldest Dryas (OLD), Bølling, Older Dryas (OD), Allerød, and Younger Dryas (YD). These 

terms were established in the beginning of the 20th century, primarily describing 

biostratigraphic changes, more specifically changes in the content of palynomorphs in 

sediment layers, in Danish lakes. The alternation between layers containing pollen from 

Dryas octopetala, characteristic of tundra, and remains of Bertulaceae family, adjusted to 

temperate climate, indicated the oscillation between extremely cold and milder climates, 

respectively (Iversen, 1954; Anderson, 1997). 

In this sense, OLD is chronostratigraphically poorly defined, being usually replaced by 

Heinrich Stadial 1 because of the apparent synchronicity (Rasmussen et al., 2014). The term 

OD, referring to a brief relatively cold phase between Allerød and Bølling warm phases 

(Wohlfarth, 1996) around 13.5 cal kyr BP, has not been used because of the little evidence for 



 
 
 
 

15 

a comparably significant climatic oscillation between Allerød and Bølling warm phases 

outside of Northern Europe (Gray and Lowe, 1977), in principle justifying the usage of 

Bølling-Allerød as one continuous warm phase (interstadial). YD is a relative term 

distinguishing between a younger layer chronostratigraphically dated around 12 cal kyr BP 

and OD. Among these terms, YD is the most largely used.   

The Bølling-Allerød Interstadial (BA), on the other hand, has been consistently 

described in tree-rings from Germany (Friedrich et al., 2001), marine sediments from Cariaco 

Basin (Hughen et al., 2000), stalagmites in Asia (e.g., Sinha et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2013), 

Mg/Ca in planktonic foraminifera from the western South Atlantic (Chiessi et al., 2008), ice 

cores from Greenland (e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2014; although in this record BA is referred to 

as DO-1), and the South American Andes (e.g., Thompson et al., 1998). 

The BA is one of the most significant abrupt events of Termination I. One of the 

reasons relates to the major increase in atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations, around 12 

ppmv (parts per million per volume) and 150 ppbv (parts per billion per volume), 

respectively, within a time interval between 50 and 200 years (Marcott et al., 2014), and a 

sea-level rise of ~20 m in less than 500 years, namely Melt Water Pulse 1A (MWP1A) 

(Deschamps et al., 2012).  

The mechanisms that explain its occurrence remain unclear, but there have been 

indications that increased inflow of warm saline waters from the Indian Ocean entered the 

Atlantic via the Agulhas Leakage around 14.9 cal kyr BP (Chiessi et al., 2008), which may 

have contributed for the abrupt resumption  of the AMOC and consequently for the warming 

in the NH (McManus et al., 2004). Further on, a study by Thiagarajan et al. (2014) showed 

evidence that a thermal inversion (warm waters under cold ones) developed in deep North 

Atlantic around 15 cal kyr BP. This metastable thermal inversion was sustained by differential 

salinity content and may have stored heat in deep North Atlantic, triggering the rapid AMOC 

restart at the onset of BA as the built up warmth was released (Thiagarajan et al., 2014). In yet 

another hypothesis, Koehler et al. (2014) defend that a sudden decrease in atmospheric ?14C 

around the onset of the BA indicates degassing of an extremely 14C–poor or even 14C–free 

carbon source, possibly connected with thawing of extended areas of NH permafrost, would 

have led to the anomalous northern hemispheric warming during the BA.  



 
 
 
 

16 

Whichever may have been the exact mechanism that led to the onset of the BA, it is 

widely accepted that it is synchronous with a rapid switch in AMOC strength (McManus et 

al., 2004; Koehler et al., 2014) and that the abrupt atmospheric warming together with oceanic 

reorganization had world wide impact, leading to a return to colder conditions in Antarctica 

(e.g., Weber et al., 2014), an abrupt warm phase in Bolivian Andes (Thompson et al., 1998) 

and, higher terrigenous input as well as relatively warmer SST in Cariaco Basin (Peterson et 

al., 2000; Lea et al., 2003). The latter changes in Cariaco Basin probably indicate a northward 

shift (comparing to HS1) of the ITCZ during the BA. This condition may have led to a 

weakening of the SAMS and drier than normal conditions in central and eastern South 

America (Catunda et al., in prep., see attached manuscript)

3. Study area, modern oceanography and climatology / Área de 

estudo, oceanografia e climatologia modernas 

 Study area / Área de estudo  

The marine sediment cores selected for this project, GeoB3227-2 and GeoB3228-1 

(Pätzold et al., 1996) (see section 4.1), were collected on the eastern Brazilian continental 

slope at the Espírito Santo Basin, southward of the Abrolhos Bank and Vitória-Trindade 

Ridge and close to the Doce River Canyon System (Schreiner et al., 2009). Continental slopes 

present the most unstable sedimentation areas in the oceans, favorable for the development of 

canyons and submarine incisions that serve as channels for the transport of terrigenous 

sediments from shallower areas and the continent to the deep ocean by turbidity currents 

(Heezen et al., 1959).  

Eastern Brazil (30°S to 15°S) is characterized by a mountainous landscape, bordered by 

narrow coastal plains, high rainfall, tropical vegetation, and relatively short coastal rivers, 

limiting the terrigenous input to the Eastern South American continental margin between La 

Plata and São Francisco rivers (Summerhayes et al., 1976; de Almeida et al., 1981).  

The Doce River Basin (Figure 3.1) is an important medium sized drainage basin in 

eastern Brazilian coastal zone (Marques et al., 2004; de Oliveira et al., 2012) with area of 

86.715 km2 (http://www.cbhdoce.org.br/; Souza and Knoppers, 2003) constituting the second 

largest drainage basin in eastern Brazil (after the São Francisco River Basin). The Doce River 

originates in the mountainous hinterland, over 1300m of altitude (i.e., Serra da Mantiqueira 

and Serra do Espinhaço) and throughout its 850km course crosses the crystalline Precambrian 

basement, covered by a thick weathered mantle, and the Tertiary coastal iron-rich sediments 

of the Barreiras-Formation (Gunnell, 1998; Carmo and Vasconcelos, 2004). 

http://www.cbhdoce.org.br/

Terrigenous sediments at our marine core sites (Figures 3.1 and 3.2) have been directly 

delivered by the Doce River (Tintelnot, 1995; Tintelnot et al., 1998) during Late Pleistocene, 

when the river’s mouth was located beyond the current shelf break, locally between 60 and 70 

m water depth (Bastos et al., 2015). Under Pleistocene low sea-level conditions, the likely 

transport path for terrigenous sediment to the study site was via one of the incised valleys of 

the Doce River Canyon System (Brush et al., 2004; Schreiner et al., 2009; Maia, 2013; Figure 

3.2). Connections between the river and these incised valleys have been previously suggested 

in the scientific literature (França, 1979; Alves, 1999; Maia, 2013; França et al., 2015). 

Furthermore, geochemical measurements at the mid-continental slope of the Abrolhos Bank 

and the Doce River shelf (Tintelnot, 1995; Massé et al., 1996) registered high kaolinite 

contents, connected with the eastern and southeastern Brazilian rivers’ mineralogical 

signature, supporting our provenance hypothesis.

The river’s mouth forms the largest wave-influenced delta in the Brazilian coast, which 

progradated continuously through the late Pleistocene, dominated by fluvial processes. The 

delta formation kept pace with the deglacial rising sea level due to relatively high rainfall in 

the Doce River drainage basin and high amount of total suspended sediments transported by 

the river (Rossetti et al., 2015).

 Modern oceanography of the western South Atlantic adjacent to the 

Doce River shelf / Oceanografia moderna do oeste do Atlântico Sul 

adjacente à plataforma do Rio Doce 

The outer shelf and upper 600 m of the water column over the continental slope in the 

study area are occupied by the Brazil Current (BC). Starting around 10oS and flowing 

southward, BC is the western boundary current that closes the SSG (Figure 3.3). It originates 

at the bifurcation of the southern branch of South Equatorial Current, that also feeds the North 

Brazil Current (NBC; Stramma, 1991; Stramma and England, 1999). The BC starts as a 

relatively weak western boundary current transporting waters warmer than 20°C and more 

saline than 36 psu, namely Tropical Surface Water (TSW), increasing its transport volume 

southwards as the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) reinforces the southward flow 

(Emílsson, 1961; Peterson and Stramma, 1991; Stramma and England, 1999; da Silveira et al., 

2000). The latter, is located just below the mixed layer (that has its lower limit around 70 m), 

and is described by a straight line between 20?C, 36 psu and 5?C, 34.3 psu in T-S diagrams 

(Figure 3.4; Stramma and England, 1999). Although SACW mainly originates in the SSG, it 

also receives contribution from the south Indian Ocean by Agulhas Current intrusions 

(Stramma and England, 1999). Only the upper ca. 100 m of the water column are affected by 

seasonally varying temperatures and salinities in the western tropical South Atlantic (Peterson 

and Stramma, 1991). 

The interaction of the BC, the morphological barrier of the broad and shallow Abrolhos 

Bank and the Vitória-Trindade Ridge characterize the surface hydrography in the study area. 

In April 1982, Evans et al. (1983) collected data showing that the BC flowed continuously 

through the passage closest to the coast and continued in a confined and organized way over 

the continental slope. That view was adopted in the works of several following authors, 

including Peterson and Stramma (1991). However, data from surface drifters revealed the 

unexpected oceanographic complexity of the region, that is strongly affected by the temporal 

occurrence and migration of the Vitória Eddy (Schmid et al., 1995). It was then confirmed 

that the surface temperatures and productivity on the shelf edge are affected by upwelling of 

SACW during austral summer, as previously suggested by Summerhayes et al. (1976). 

Consequently, the Doce River shelf presents special conditions, where local land input and 

upwelling of relatively nutrient-rich SACW at the shelf edge are significant factors

influencing the local sedimentation and primary production (Summerhayes et al., 1976; Ekau 

and Knoppers, 1996; Knoppers et al., 1999).  

Below SACW, at intermediate depths (i.e., 500 to 1500 m), the Intermediate Western 

Boundary Current transports AAIW and the underlying UCDW equatorwards (Figure 3.4; 

Tsuchiya and Talley, 1994; Schmid et al., 1995; da Silveira et al., 2004). Compared with 

AAIW, SACW is warm and salty (Stramma and England, 1999). AAIW is formed in the 

Subantarctic Frontal Zone (Talley, 1996) from a surface region of the circumpolar layer and 

its characteristic relative oxygen maximum and salinity minimum were found in the study 

area at 800m water depth (Tsuchiya and Talley, 1994; Locarnini et al., 2013). Below AAIW, 

UCDW is defined by its very low oxygen content and can be recognized as an oxygen 

minimum tongue lying just under the relatively well oxygenated AAIW (Tsuchiya and Talley,

1994). UCDW’s relative potential temperature minimum and oxygen minimum were found 

around 1100m.  

At greater depths, the western tropical South Atlantic is filled by the southward flowing 

North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) between ca. 1500 and 3000 m water depth, and two 

southern sourced northward flowing water masses, namely Lower Circumpolar Deep Water 

(LCDW) between ca. 3000 and 3500 m water depth, and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) 

present between ca. 3500 m water depth and the bottom of the ocean (Stramma and England, 

1999). While NADW shows relatively high salinities, low nutrient content and high oxygen 

values, AAIW and UCDW are relatively fresh, show high nutrient content and low oxygen 

values (Figure 3.4).

 Modern climatology of Doce River basin / Climatologia moderna da 

Bacia do Rio Doce  

The Doce River basin is located in a hot and humid tropical climate region with distinct 

rainy summer and dry fall-winter seasons (i.e., Cwb, Cwa and Aw, Köppen-Geiger climate 

types; Peel et al., 2007). This seasonality is due to SASM and SACZ activity, fed by moisture 

from the ITCZ (see section 2.1.2). The average precipitation in the basin is 1400 mm/a with at 

least 80% of the rain falling during the rainy season (October to March; Figure 3.5). 

Exceptionally, in areas close to the coast, rains are distributed throughout the year, with 

austral winter rainfall brought by extratropical cyclones during the winter (Garreaud et al., 

2009). The river discharge is also the second largest of the Brazilian eastern coast and is 

strongly seasonal, following the rainfall pattern. The river’s runoff averages at 900 m3/s, 

varying from 500 m3/s, from May to October, to 1300 m3/s, from November to April 

(www2.ana.gov.br; runoff measurements from the Colatina Water Station, located 90 km 

from the river mouth). Table 3.1 provides details about the selected locations for which 

precipitation histograms are shown in Figure 3.5.

Gravity cores GeoB3227-2 (19°49’12” S, 38°47’24” W, 1340 mbsl and 564 cm total 

length) and GeoB3228-1 (19°45’36” S, 38°45’36” W, 1095 mbsl and 567 cm total length) 

were retrieved from the Brazilian continental slope during RV Victor Hensen cruise JOPS II, 

leg 8 (Pätzold et al., 1996). The core sites are located 105 km from the modern Brazilian 

coastline and 110 km of the current mouth of the Doce River, at the Espírito Santo Basin. The 

gravity cores were stored at 4oC under controlled humidity in the GeoB Core Repository, 

MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen, Germany. 

 Methods / Métodos 

4.2.1. Marine sediment cores visual evaluation, sampling and sample processing / 

Avaliação visual dos testemunhos de sedimento marinho, amostragem e 

processamento das amostras 

Gravity core GeoB3227-2, 564 cm long, is composed of olive gray clay and mud. 

Exceptionally, between depths 56 cm and 233 cm the sediment is reddish brown. Gravity core 

GeoB3228-1 presents similar characteristics to GeoB3227-2. It is constituted mostly of olive 

gray mud with a reddish brown layer between 66 cm and 150 cm (Figure 4.1). 

Marine sediment core GeoB3228-1 was sampled for isotopic analyses every two 

centimeters (276 samples in total) with 10 ml syringes, labelled, weighted while wet, packed 

and brought to the Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology Laboratory (P2L) at the School of 

Arts, Sciences and Humanities of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. 

The sample’s preparation for benthic foraminifera selection was executed in the P2L, 

and consisted in drying (50?C maximum oven temperature), weighting the dry samples to 

calculate water content, soaking in a beaker with water overnight, wet sieving over &gt;125µm 

and &gt;63µm combined meshes, rinsing both fractions with Milli-Q water and final drying 

(50?C maximum oven temperature) of the residues. After these steps, both fractions (&gt;125 µm 

and between 125 µm and 63 µm) were stored in glass vials, labeled, and weighted.  



 
 
 
 

26 

The sample’s preparation for calibration of the element intensities was executed in 

laboratories from the University of Bremen, Germany. At the MARUM – Center for Marine 

Environmental Sciences, 24 samples from GeoB3228-1 and 21 samples from GeoB3227-2 

were selected and taken with cut syringes to be analyzed via Energy Dispersive X-Ray 

Fluorescence (EDP-XRF). Samples were spaced 25 cm on average, but a smaller value was 

chosen for a better representation of core sections that showed distinct features on a Fe/Ca 

versus depth plot. The 45 samples were freeze-dried, powdered and homogenized with an 

agate mortar.

4.2.2. AMS radiocarbon dating and age models / Datações radiocarbônicas AMS e 

modelos de idade 

Radiocarbon analyses were used to establish accurate age models for the sediment cores 

selected for this dissertation. With this purpose, one AMS 14C dating was performed 

approximately every 50 cm for each marine sediment core. 

Three AMS 14C ages obtained at 6, 200 and 300 cm core depths of core GeoB3227-2 

were already available (Chiessi et al., unpublished data; Table 5.1, section 5.1). Similarly, 

seven AMS 14C ages at 8, 58, 108, 158, 208, 258 and 508 cm core depths of core GeoB3228-1 

were also available (Chiessi et al., unpublished data; Table 5.1, section 5.1). 

For this project, 15 samples were chosen to produce detailed age models for both 

gravity cores. After sample preparation, 10mg of Globiogerinoides ruber tests (around 600 

tests) of each sample were selected for AMS 14C dating from the &gt;125 µm fraction using 25-

50X magnification under a binocular microscope. For those cases where not enough G. ruber 

specimens were available, the sample was complemented with Globigerinoides sacculifer. 

When both species were not enough to reach the desired mass, the amount was completed 

with other planktic species, avoiding deep-dwellers such as Globorotalia truncatulinoides. 

The 15 samples were then sent for analyses via AMS at BETA Analytic Laboratory, Miami, 

USA.  

The raw radiocarbon ages were calibrated for the reservatory effect (Franke et al., 2008) 

and for variations on the original 14C concentration in the atmosphere (Reimer et al., 2013). 

For this calibration we used software Calib 7.0.2 (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and the 

Marine13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2013). Age models were produced based on the 

linear interpolation of the calibrated ages. 

4.2.3. Benthic foraminifera selection strategy / Estratégia para seleção de foraminíferos 

bentônicos 

Before starting the systematic picking of benthic foraminifera for ?13C and ?18O 

analyses, a preliminary selection of Cibicidoides/Cibicides and Uvigerina genera was 

performed to assess the species availability within the first half of GeoB3228-1. The search 

was conducted to evaluate if there was any unique species of these genera that would be 

present throughout the Holocene and Termination I sections of the core, established using the

preliminary age model available. The results of this preliminary search are shown in Table 

4.1.

The only consistently found species was Uvigerina peregrina (Cushman, 1923) and no 

single Cibicidoides or Cibicides species was present on all samples. From these latter genera, 

the following species were found (from the more abundant to the less abundant): Cibicidoides 

subhaidingerii (Parr, 1950), Cibicides pachyderma (Rzehak, 1886) and Cibicides 

wuellerstorfi (Schwager, 1866). Thus, U. peregrina and Cibicidoides spp. (a mixture among 

Cibicides and/or Cibicidoides specimes present at each sample) specimens were picked 

separately.  

Microfossil slides were used to store three to eight tests of U. peregrina or Cibicidoides 

spp.. Each test was over 0.3 mm and picked from the &gt;125µm fraction using 25-50X 

magnification under a binocular microscope. On eventual samples where the Cibicidoides 

and/or Cibicides genera were abundant, three to five tests of individual species were picked. 

This aimed to perform a comparison between Cibicidoides spp. isotopic values and species 

specific isotopic offsets available in the scientific literature (e.g., Fontanier et al., 2006). 

In total 441 samples of benthic foraminifera were picked along GeoB3228-1’s full 

extension.

4.2.4. ?18O and ?13C of benthic foraminifera / ?18O e ?13C de foraminíferos bentônicos 

Oxygen and carbon stable isotopes are traditional paleooceanographic proxies used for 

reconstituting physical and chemical characteristics of water masses and ocean circulation. 

?18O in marine carbonates is presently widely applied for assessing past variability in ocean 

circulation (e.g., Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2006), continental ice volume (e.g., Waelbroeck et al., 

2002), ocean water salinity (e.g., Adkins et al., 2002; Weldeab et al., 2006) and, paired with 

Mg/Ca, temperature (e.g., Emiliani, 1955; Waelbroeck et al., 2002). ?13C of foraminiferal 

calcite provide a wealth of information on the carbon cycling of the oceans, and has been used 

to infer the distribution of deep water masses and their geographic and bathymetric 

distributions (e.g., Curry and Oppo, 2005), but also for variations of biological productivity 

and variations in the global carbon cycle (e.g., Duplessy et al., 1988).  

Isotopic ratios of stable isotopes are a measurement of fractionation processes. The 

isotopic composition of a sample is expressed using the ? notation (i.e., ?18O and ?13C), which 

represents the difference between the ratio of the least over the most abundant isotope of a 

sample and an internationally recognized standard, expressed in parts per thousand (i.e., ‰). 

Equation 1 exemplifies the calculation of ?18O. 

Equation 1: 

?18??????? = [
( ?18 ?16? )

??????
? ( ?18 ?16? )

, which can be written as: 

?18??????? = [

??????

( ?18 ?16? )
????????

? 1] ?103 

 

For carbonate isotopic ratios the most used standard is Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite 

(VPDB), normalized in relationship to the chemical composition of Belemnitella americana 

fossil shells from the cretaceous Pee Dee Formation in the United States and provided by the 

International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.

The oxygen isotopic composition in marine carbonates varies both with temperature and 

the isotopic composition of seawater, which is in turn dependent on the global ice volume and 

correlated with local salinity (Waelbroeck et al., 2002; Mulitza et al., 2003). Surface ?18Ow is 

generally positively correlated to salinity because both parameters are largely controlled by 

evaporation and precipitation (Craig and Gordon, 1965). Although the relationship between 

salinity, temperature and foraminiferal ?18O is relatively well understood, the latter cannot be 

used as a directly proportionate proxy for either temperature or salinity because both affect 

?18O in opposite directions and, therefore, tend to cancel each other out (Curry and Oppo, 

2005). Still, the equilibrium calcite ?18O values of water masses originating in the South 

Atlantic is generally higher at every water depth and denser than water masses originating in 

the North Atlantic because the difference in temperature dominates the equilibrium ?18O 

values (Curry and Oppo, 2005). ?18O in benthic foraminifera is a valuable deep water tracer, 

which values reflect conservative sea water properties and, assuming negligible geothermal 

and pressure heating effects, can only change due to mixing between water masses (e.g., 

Oppo et al., 2015).  

A wide variety of factors affect seawater carbon composition (e.g., biological 

productivity and global carbon cycle) and its isotopic incorporation in foraminiferal calcite 

(e.g., species specific vital effects). Despite of that, ?13C is a useful proxy as water mass tracer 

because it is characteristic of its formation and can only be altered by mixing with water 

masses of another ?13C composition, by the oxidation of low-?13C organic matter or ‘‘aging’’ 

(Curry and Lohmann, 1982; Kroopnick, 1985; Curry and Oppo, 2005).  

Foraminifera use marine total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to precipitate their 

calcite tests, recording ?13C of seawater. DIC comprises the sum of the concentrations of CO2 

(aqueous carbon dioxide), HCO3- (bicarbonate), and CO3
2- (carbonate ion), and seawater pH 

controls the relative proportion of the different components (Kroopnick, 1985). Biological 

primary production in the euphotic zone, when producers take up nutrients and carbon 

(photosynthesis), strongly fractionates stable carbon isotopes concentrating the light isotope 

12C in organic matter, and enriching superficial water in 13C (Freeman and Hayes, 1992), as 

recorded by shallow dwelling planktonic foraminifera. Deeper in the water column, the 12C-

rich organic matter is oxidized and remineralized, adding nutrients, and carbon with low 

13C/12C, to deep waters (Duplessy et al., 1984). As a result of these processes, nutrients and 



 
 
 
 

31 

?13C of DIC are generally negatively correlated, and nutrient-rich southern sourced water 

masses like AAIW, CDW and AABW have relatively low ?13C values, while nutrient-poor 

NADW shows high ?13C values (Kroopnick, 1985). High nutrient concentrations and low 

?13C in AABW, for example, reflect the longer time these waters have spent away from the 

surface, collecting nutrients and 13C-poor carbon from the decay of organic matter transported 

to abyssal depths in particulate and dissolved forms.  

The ?13C in surface waters is also influenced by air-sea gas exchange, which is favored 

in cold, windy regions (Broecker and Maier Reimer, 1992), such as the Subantarctic Frontal 

Zone. 13C enrichment of dissolved CO2 in surface seawater results from the temperature-

dependent fractionation of 13C/12C during the exchange of CO2 at the water atmosphere 

interface (Mook et al., 1974). Colder waters display a larger fractionation and higher ?13C 

values for DIC. Gas exchange rates also depend on wind mixing in the surface ocean with 

stronger winds allowing the ?13C of DIC in seawater to equilibrate with the atmosphere. 

Owing to substantial exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the cold surface waters of 

the Southern Ocean, the present-day AAIW, for instance, is more enriched in ?13C by ~1‰ 

than would be expected on the basis of its nutrient content and biological productivity 

(Ninnemann and Charles, 1997; Ninnemann and Charles, 2002). 

The applicability of ?13C of benthic foraminifera is relatively limited by the scarce 

knowledge about the complex effects of ecological, biogeochemical and physical parameters. 

Therefore, the comparison of the ?13C signal of different species should consider differences 

in metabolism and calcification rate of the organisms, namely species-specific vital effects. In 

addition, the ?13C composition of the test carbonate varies with the microhabitat of different 

species reflecting ?13C gradients of DIC in the pore water (Schmiedl and Mackensen, 2006). 

Species-specific vital effects in the ?13C signal are caused by differential incorporation 

of 13C-depleted metabolic CO2 into the test carbonate (e.g., Erez, 1978). Epifaunal taxa 

commonly calcify close to the isotopic signature of bottom water ?13CDIC, whereas infaunal 

taxa bear a pore water signal which is marked by 13C depletion (Corliss, 1985; Fontanier et 

al., 2006). Among genera of benthic foraminifera, the epifaunal Cibicidoides and Planulina 

seem to record the bottom water ?13CDIC most reliably (Duplessy et al., 1984; Schmiedl and 

Mackensen, 2006), although negative deviations in the ?13C values are possible as response to 

phytodetritus pulses in regions of very high productivity (Mackensen et al., 1993).  



 
 
 
 

32 

The infaunal Uvigerina peregrina preferentially occupies the uppermost surface 

centimeter, and commonly approaches precipitation in equilibrium with ?18O (e.g., Schmiedl 

et al., 2004), allowing its use as substitute for the Cibicidoides genera. According to 

(Schmiedl and Mackensen, 2006) average metabolic effects amount to –0.6‰ for 

Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and 0.0‰ for Uvigerina peregrina in relationship with bottom 

waters ?18O.  

The assessment of metabolic effects in the ?13C signal of taxa from different 

microhabitats on and within the sediment is hampered by the dominance of environmental 

factors including gradients between ?13CDIC and CO3
2- in pore water and near-surface 

sediment, controlled by remineralization of organic matter (McCorkle et al., 1990; Schmiedl 

et al., 2004). Schmiedl and Mackensen (2006) calculated the ?13C differences between 

epifauna (C. wuellerstorfi) and shallow infauna (U. peregrina) between 0.16 and 1.35‰ in 

the Arabian Sea and interpreted them as changes in organic carbon (Corg) oxidation rates of 

bottom waters. Also, in that study, intervals of maximum deepwater oxygenation coincided 

with high benthic foraminiferal diversity and were interpreted as increased admixture of well-

oxygenated deepwater masses close to the ocean floor. 

The 441 samples stored in microfossil slides were sent for ?18O and ?13C analysis at the 

Stable Isotopes Laboratory at the MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, 

University of Bremen, Germany. 

Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were measured on a Finnigan MAT 253 gas 

isotope ratio mass spectrometer with Kiel IV automated carbonate preparation device. The 

instrument was calibrated using the in house standard (Solnhofen limestone), itself calibrated 

against the NBS 18 and NBS 19 standard reference materials. Standards and replicate 

analyses are performed to avoid drift in the machine and bias in the results through 

contamination as well as to assess the machine precision and accuracy. The data are reported 

in the usual delta-notation against Vienna-PDB. The standard deviations (reproducibility) for 

repeated measurements of the in house standard were 0.03‰ for ?13C and 0.07‰ for ?18O. 

Ice volume corrections were done for our Cibicidoides spp. ?18O (?18Oc) and U. 

peregrina ?18O (?18Ou) records (corrected records shown only on the discussion, subsection 

6.2). Corrections were calculated considering 1.00‰ as the global average change in ?18O of

4.2.5. Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca ratios in oceanic basins as paleoclimatological proxies / Razões 

Fe/Ca e Ti/Ca como indicadores paleoclimáticos  

Terrigenous materials deposited off the tropical and subtropical Atlantic South 

American coast are delivered to the ocean via fluvial pathways, which are highly sensitive to 

climate change. High concentrations of terrigenous elements and low Ca concentrations along 

the tropical and subtropical South American and African continental margins reflect the 

dominance of terrigenous input in these regions (Govin et al., 2012). A number of studies 

have used major element composition of marine sediment cores to trace changes in 

terrigenous input into the Atlantic. In the last decade, the number of studies focusing on the 

South American Margin increased significantly (Arz et al., 1998; Arz et al., 1999; Peterson et 

al., 2000; Haug et al., 2001; Jaeschke et al., 2007; Chiessi et al., 2010). Yet, the 23-7ºS sector 

of the Brazilian continental margin remains completely void of studies. This is a particularly 

relevant sector of the continental margin for reconstructing the strength of the SACZ and the 

SASM (see section 2.1.2).  

The late advances of this field come as a result of the relatively recent development of 

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanners that can obtain nondestructive, almost continuous 

and relatively fast measurements of the intensities of major elements directly at the surface of 

sediment cores. Its results are usually presented in count rates or intensity of elements, which 

can be calibrated into element concentrations using further Energy Dispersive X-Ray 

Fluorescence (EDP-XRF) discrete geochemical analysis and an algorithm by (Weltje and 

Tjallingii, 2008). 

Fe and Ti within marine sediment cores can be used as tracers of the siliciclastic 

components of terrestrial sediments, and vary proportionally to the terrigenous fraction in the 

sea floor, whereas Ca in this setting is largely derived from biogenic CaCO3 shell material 

(mostly pteropods, foraminifera, and calcareous nannoplankton; Govin et al., 2012). Some 

studies of marine sediments (i.e., Govin et al., 2012) have suggested that single element 

concentrations are sensitive to dilution effects (i.e., enhanced biological productivity, 

carbonate dissolution) to allow reliable reconstructions of terrestrial climate, which can also 

affect elemental ratios including Ca (e.g., Fe/Ca). Therefore, in an area where post 



 
 
 
 

34 

depositional carbonate dissolution and/or overgrowth are negligible or ruled out, elemental 

ratios including Ca (e.g., Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca) can be used to discuss marine versus terrigenous 

input.  

Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca ratios have hence been used to trace changes in terrigenous input of 

fluvial origin, particularly offshore northeastern Brazil, where repeated authors pointed out 

increases in the terrigenous input during Heinrich events due to southward shifts of the ITCZ 

(Arz et al., 1998; Arz et al., 1999; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Jaeschke et al., 2007; Nace et al., 

2014; Stríkis et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). 

The archive halves of GeoB3227-2 and GeoB3228-1 were scanned for Fe, Ti and Ca 

using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) Core Scanner II (AVAATECH Serial No. 2, 10kV, and 

0.35 mA) at the MARUM – Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of 

Bremen, Germany. Prior and after daily analysis, the instrument was calibrated against a set 

of pressed powder standards (Jansen et al., 1998). The elements’ intensity or counts were 

determined at 5 mm intervals with 20 seconds of irradiation time directly over the pristine 

surface of the archive halves of the cores. Acquired XRF spectra were processed with the 

WinAxil and WinBatch software packages. The resulting data were expressed as element 

intensities in counts per second. 

4.2.6. Calibration of XRF-scanner data via EDP-XRF / Calibração de dados de scanner 

de XRF via EDP-XRF 

Fe, Ti and Ca absolute concentrations were measured using EDP-XRF on a Panalytical 

Epsilon 3X spectrometer. Analytical quality of the measurements were assessed by repeated 

analysis of several different certified standard reference materials (e.g. MAG-1; Govindaraju 

et al., 1994). The measured values were within 1% of accepted values. The standard deviation 

of replicated sediment samples was less than 2%. The elements concentrations are expressed 

in grams per kilogram (g/kg) of dry sediment. Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios discussion and 

conclusion are shown in the attached manuscript “South American summer monsoon 

decreased intensity related to the Bølling-Allerød interstadial” (Catunda et al., in prep).

 Radiocarbon ages and age models / Idades radiocarbônicas e modelos de 

idade 

Age models of sediment cores GeoB3227-2 and GeoB3228-1 were established using 25 

AMS 14C ages, compiled on Table 5.1. Figure 5.1 shows the age models and the 

sedimentation rates of both cores. 

The gravity cores show quasi linear age models during deglacial and glacial periods, 

with high mean sedimentation rates (GeoB3227-2, 20 cm/kyr, and GeoB3228-1, 17 cm/kyr). 

Within the period when both cores overlap, the lowest sedimentation rates recorded in both 

cores occur from 18 to 13.8 cal kyr BP (ka hereafter, present established as 1950). 

Interestingly, both cores seem to have recorded a regional sedimentation disturbance during 

the early/middle Holocene.

The age models present a reversed age each at 45 and 58 cm of GeoB3227-2 and 

GeoB3228-1, respectively. We believe these age reversals are connected with a regional 

sedimentary disturbance visually identified by the reddish layers (discussed on subsections 

5.3 and 6.1). We therefore calculated the age models excluding the 14C ages within the 

reddish layers (at 45 cm and 112 cm of GeoB3227-2, and 58 cm, 108 cm and 109 cm of 

GeoB3228-1). Unfortunately, since the ages around ~50 cm in both gravity cores were 

anomalous it was not possible to estimate sedimentation rates for the shallowest section of 

these cores. Thus, GeoB3227-2 covers the period between 11.9 ka (200 cm) to 31.2 ka (556 

cm - estimated with linear extrapolation of the sedimentation rate), and GeoB3228-1 covers 

the period between 12.25 ka (158 cm) and 41 ka (548cm). 

 ?18O and ?13C of benthic foraminifera / ?18O e ?13C de foraminíferos 

bentônicos  

To evaluate Cibicidoides spp. isotopic values and species specific isotopic offsets, 

Figure 5.2 shows ?18O and ?13C of all samples from the uppermost half of GeoB3228-1 

divided by species. 

In Figure 5.2, ?13C values of Cibicidoides spp. are distributed scatteredly through the Y 

axis. This scattering can be explained by the fact that Cibicidoides spp. is composed by a 

variable mixture of different Cibicidoides and Cibicides species with different species specific 

offsets, notably C. subhaidingerii (Holbourn et al., 2002) one of the most abundant 

(apparently) epibenthic species in the uppermost half of GeoB3228-1. In their work, Holbourn 

et al. (2002), found that a heavily calcified test morphotype described as C. subhaidingerii 

alpha shows lower values of ?13C (0.5–1‰) when compared with C. subhaidingerii beta and 

Planulina wuellerstorfi / C. wuellerstorfi, plotting closer to values of U. peregrina. Within 

our record nevertheless, ?13C of C. subhaidingerii presents ?13C values around 2‰ lower than 

C. wuellerstorfi samples and between 0.7-1‰ lower than U. peregrina. ?18O of C. 

subhaidingerii was also found consistently higher than Planulina wuellerstorfi / C. 

wuellerstorfi (~0.65‰) and closer to U. peregrina values. Explaining also why the ?13C 

values of ~1000m deep water for the Holocene and LGM published by Curry and Oppo 

(2005) are higher than our record, closer to C. wuellerstorfi isotopic values (Figure 5.2). 

Therefore, when integrating isotopic results from the whole marine sediment core, we decided 

to exclude the data of all Cibicidoides spp. samples that contained C. subhaidingerii of our 



 
 
 
 

38 

record (43 out of the 61 samples from the selected time window from 12 to 41 ka). The 

epibenthic ?18O and ?13C values showed in Figures 5.3 and 5.4 include the results of the 17 

remaining samples of Cibicidoides spp. along with the monospecific results of C. 

wuellerstorfi, C. pachyderma and Cibicides spp.. Intervals of more than 2 kyr without 

Cibicidoides values were left as gaps. 

Given that the age reversals coincided with the reddish layer, an unusual scattering on 

?13C and ?18O data and also a Fe/Ca anomaly (see section 5.3) we decided, for the moment, 

not to interpret the records until the bottom of the reddish layer (i.e., 150 cm core depth). 

Also, as our results were unevenly spaced in time and to preserve the timing of isotopic 

variability, we used the integrated interpolation function embedded on the Analyseries 2.0.8 

software every 1 kyr (Figures 5.3 and 5.4). Within the studied time window (12 to 41 ka), the 

reservoir ?18O changed considerably because of expansion and retraction of global ice 

volume. However, a recent paper (i.e., Lund et al., 2015) argues against the use of ice volume 

corrections in benthic foraminiferal data because of depth-dependent timing in the evolution 

of melt water ?18O signal, potentially yielding artificially large increases in temperature on ice 

volume corrected benthic foraminifera ?18O. We therefore define the deglacial temperature 

increase using non-corrected data, and plot ice volume corrected data (?18Ocivc and ?
18Ouivc) 

only for visual comparison in the discussion.  

U. peregrina ?13C record begins with values around -0.7‰ at 41.5 ka and decrease to -

0.95‰ at 39 ka, the approximate timing of Heinrich stadial 4 (Figure 5.3). It increases by 

0.3‰ after the event, locally peaking at 37 ka. After that ?13C follows a decreasing trend 

reaching a minimum at 30 ka (-1.2‰). Until 22 ka, ?13C values oscillate around -1.1‰ 

without increasing or decreasing trends. ?13C values increase to -0.9‰ around 20 ka, 

decreasing again to -1.15‰ at 17 ka. From this point ?13C consistently increases until values 

reach the records maximum around 13 ka (0‰). The remaining 0.75 kyr of our record is 

marked by a slight decrease of -0.1‰.

Cibicidoides spp. ?13C record presents, as expected, a 13C enriched record in 

relationship to the U. peregrina (Figure 5.3). The difference or offset between ?13Cc and ?
13Cu 

(??13C) oscillated up to 0.9‰ (?offset) within our record, from 0.7‰ around 12 ka (minimum 

??13C) and 1.6‰ between 20 and 30 ka (maximum ??13C). The ?13Cc record begins with 

values around 0.5‰ at 41 ka, which increase to 0.65‰ at between 40 and 38 ka, during the 

approximate duration of HS4. ?13C values decrease to 0.4‰ in the period between 36 and 33 

ka and increase again to 0.6‰ until 30 ka (around HS3). For the next 9 kyr the values follow 

a decreasing trend reaching 0.4‰ at 21 ka. From this point until 18 ka, ?13C values decrease 

to the record’s minimum of 0.2‰, remaining low between 19 and 18 ka, right before values 

begin a steady rise until 14 ka. At 14 ka values reach the record’s maximum of 1‰. From this 

peak onwards ?13C values decrease until 0.8‰, at 12.25 ka. 

U. peregrina ?18O record can be divided in two domains. From the beginning of the 

record at 41.5 to 17 ka, the values have a general increasing trend varying between 4‰ and 

4.65‰, the record’s maximum. An exception to the decreasing trend is found at 29 ka, 

represented by an 0.2‰ increase, just after HS3. From 17 ka until the end of the record, ?18O 

steadily decrease, interrupted only by a 0.1‰ excursion to higher values between 14 and 13 

ka. The record’s minimum, 3.65‰, is reached at the younger limit of our studied time period, 

at 12 ka. 

Cibicidoides spp. ?18O record follows a similar trend of U. peregrina ?18O, beginning at 

3.3‰ at 41 ka, and adopting a general increasing trend until 18 ka (4.2‰), 1 kyr after U. 

peregrina ?18O peaked. From 18 ka until the end of the record, ?18O values steadily decrease 

until the record’s minimum, 2.7‰, at 12 ka. Cibicidoides spp. ?18O values exhibit offset of 

0.6‰ in relationship with U. peregrina (Holbourn et al., 2002). It is noteworthy that the 

Holocene and LGM ?18O (for ~1000m water depth) values published by Curry and Oppo 

(2005; Figure 5.4) fit very well our Cibicidoides spp. record (without C. subhaidingerii data). 

This shows that our ?18O record is replicable and coherent with other nearby published 

oxygen isotopic records.  

 Major elements in bulk sediment / Elementos maiores em sedimento total 

We show ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca), traditional element ratios usually employed to 

discuss variations of terrigenous input into oceanic basins (e.g., Arz et al., 1998; Jennerjahn et 



 
 
 

43 

al., 2004; Govin et al., 2012), that should be closely related to effective moisture on the 

adjacent continent (Figure 5.5).  

The EDP-XRF absolute concentrations were used to calibrate the scanner XRF 

intensities into calibrated proportions using the regression method described by Weltje and 

Tjallingii (2008) implemented in the software MATLAB. 

Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca log-ratios are very similar within each core. GeoB3228-1 log-ratios are 

relatively stable from 42 to 37 ka, slightly increase until 20 ka and decrease subtly from that 

age to 15.85 ka. At 15.85 ka the log ratios decrease sharply, showing decrease in Fe and Ti in 

relationship with Ca and the records’ minimum is reached at 13.6 ka. After 13.6 ka the 

terrigenous fraction increases again until 12 ka, when log ratios reach previous than 15.85 ka 

values. Within the period between 12 and 4.3 ka we find the highest ratios. This portion of the 

core corresponds with the reddish layer and contains the age reversal observed on section 

4.2.1 (Figure 5.5). From 4.3 ka to the core top at 3.2 ka ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca) assume 

relatively low values.  

The EDP-XRF ln(Ti/Ca) and ln(Fe/Ca) used for scanner-XRF calibration show almost 

perfect fit to the calibrated values with little divergence on the oldest portion of the records, 

before 31ka. 

The shorter GeoB3227-2 ln(Ti/Ca) and ln(Fe/Ca) records show a similar trend to the 

one described for GeoB3228-1. The oldest half of the record, from 31 to 14.7 ka is plateau-

shaped with relatively low amplitude oscillations. At 14.7 ka onwards there’s an abrupt 

decrease of log-ratios values until 13.7 ka, when they are at their lowest from that point to 

13.1 ka. At 13.1 ka Ti and Fe proportions in relationship to Ca sharply increase and at 12.6 ka 

they return to previous than 14.7 ka values. From 12.6 to 11.6 ka terrigenous proportions 

remain relatively stable. From 11.6 ka onwards it’s possible to observe the same increase in 

terrigenous in relationship to (marine) Ca seen on GeoB3228-1. These values are also 

coincident with the reddish sediments layer and the age reversal showed in Figure 5.5 of the 

previous section. The youngest portion of the records (estimated age from 3.5 to 0.5 ka) also 

present relatively low log-ratios values as seen in GeoB3228-1.      

The discussion about our Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca results can be found on section 5 of the paper  

“South American summer monsoon decreased intensity related to the Bølling-Allerød 

interstadial” (Catunda et al., in prep.), attached to this dissertation.

The periods with higher terrigenous concentrations, with approximate age of early and 

middle Holocene are coincident with the reddish brown layers described on both cores (see 

section 4.2.1) and the age reversals described in section 5.1. This disturbance seems to be 

regional (appears in both gravity cores, where it shows consistent ages and lithologic 

characteristics) and opens the possibility to study slope failure events and processes in the 

Espírito Santo Basin, a region of great interest for the oil industry.

6. Discussion / Discussão 

 Sedimentation on the core sites on the passage between the late 

Pleistocene and Holocene / Sedimentação no local dos testemunhos 

marinhos durante a passagem Pleistoceno tardio e Holoceno 

Today, sediment and water discharged from the Doce River are entrained in the Brazil 

Current and accumulate on the continental shelf closer to the river mouth (Bastos et al., 2015). 

During sea-level lowstand of the last glacial period, however, the Doce River mouth was 

located below the shelf break depth and the river channel incised the continental shelf and 

discharged directly into the upper continental slope. As the sea level rose during the last 

deglaciation, and overcame the shelf break (~65m water depth, Bastos et al., 2015) the low 

angle of the continental platform implied that the Doce River mouth shifted significantly 

away from the study site with every additional increment of sea level rise (Figure 6.1, 

Lambeck and Chappell, 2001, updated in 2007).  

Figure 6.1: Relative sea level (Lambeck and Chappel, 2001; updated in 2007) and 

ln(Fe/Ca) of GeoB3228-1 and GeoB3227-2 versus age. Grey dots represent AMS 14C ages 

of marine sediment core GeoB3228-1 and their respective 2? uncertainty bars, black dots 

represent AMS 14C ages of marine sediment core GeoB3227-2 and their respective 2? 

uncertainty bars, red dots represent reversed AMS 14C ages. The grey rectangle marks the 

portion of the gravity cores that was deposited after the sea level overcame the local shelf 

break (plotted at 65m water depth).  



 
 
 

47 

We hypothesize that when sea level overcame the shelf break (~12 ka) our study site 

became starved of terrigenous sediments, receiving rather occasional input from the adjacent 

continental shelf brought by slumps or turbidity currents. Sediments previously deposited in 

the Doce River plataform are simultaneously iron-rich, because of Doce River sediments, and 

relatively calcium-poor, because of the shallow depths in which it is located, possibly 

explaining the high Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca ratios in the reddish layers. Our hypothesis justifies the 

exclusion of the data obtained from the holocenic reddish layers containing age reversals on 

the studied cores.  

 Changes in southern sourced water masses isotopic signature in the 

western South Atlantic during the late glacial and Termination I 

Currently GeoB3228-1 core site is bathed by UCDW. During the LGM however, our 

study depth in the western South Atlantic has been reported to be within the Glacial Antarctic 

Intermediate Water (GAAIW) depth interval, between 850 and 1200 m (Curry and Oppo, 

2005; Makou et al., 2010; Tessin and Lund, 2013). AAIW and UCDW are both formed 

around Antarctica and have similar physical properties, being relatively fresh and nutrient rich 

(see Figures 2.2 and 4.4) in relationship to NADW, for example. To establish a relationship 

between GAAIW and the global climatic evolution, considering that AAIW is formed close to 

Antarctica, we compared our ?18O and ?13C results with temperature and CO2 data from 

Antarctic ice cores (Parrenin et al., 2013, Figure 6.2, and Bereiter et al., 2015, Figure 6.3).  

As previously mentioned in subsection 4.2.4, benthic foraminiferal ?18O is a function of 

both temperature and the ?18O of the water in which the foraminifera grows (Epstein and 

Mayeda, 1953), which is in turn affected by changes in salinity and global ice volume 

(Waelbroeck et al., 2002). After corrections for global ice volume however, even though 

calcitic ?18O is affected by the interplay of temperature and salinity, the former dominates the 

equilibrium ?18O values in the deep ocean (Curry and Oppo, 2005). We therefore interpret 

?18O of benthic foraminifera in terms of temperature and global ice volume oscillations 

(Figure 6.2).

Overall, likely due to higher resolution and species consistency our U. peregrina ?18O 

(?18Ou and ?
18Ouivc, when referred to ice volume corrected data) and U. peregrina ?

13C (?13Cu) 

records reflected Antarctic temperature and CO2 evolution better than their Cibicidoides 

counterparts (?18Oc and ?
18Ocivc, when referred to ice volume corrected data, and ?

13Cc). As an 

example, on ?18Oc, the marked deglacial ?
18O decrease began before than in the ?18Ou record, 

at 18ka. However, between 20 and 16 ka, the ?18Oc record was defined only by 4 samples of 

mixed Cibicidoides species, and therefore we decided to base our conclusions regarding ?18O 

on the ?18Ou record.  

Although the Antarctic temperature composite (Figure 6.2; Parrenin et al., 2013) shows 

several relatively small temperature oscillations between 42 ka and 27 ka, the only oscillation 

consistently found on our ?18O records within this time window is a 1.1°C increase in 

Antarctica during HS3 (at 29.9 ka, pink arrow on Figure 6.2). Contemporaneously, our high 

resolution ?18Ou registered an ~ 0.32 ‰ decrease (pink arrow on Figure 6.2). Considering that 

every ~ 0.25 ‰ represents around a 1°C change in cold waters (Marchitto et al., 2014), the 

?18Ou 0.32 ‰ decrease would be equivalent to a 1.25°C warming in GAAIW but centered at 

29.0 ka, with a ~900 years delay. The warming of GAAIW during HS3 could be linked to an 

slowdown of the AMOC described by Böhm et al. (2015) and a consequent long term 

accumulation of heat in the Southern Ocean or due to warming of GAAIW at its area of 

formation.  

The most notable change in all ?18O records was the expressive ?18O decrease during 

the HS1 (red arrow on Figure 6.2). On our high resolution ?18Ou record the deglacial decrease 

took place at 17 ka, in accordance with other related studies in western South Atlantic 

(Waelbroeck et al., 2011; Lund et al., 2015). Most of the global deglacial warming happened 

during the HS1, when temperatures in Antarctica rose around 2 °C/kyr from 17.7 to 14.7 ka 

(Parrenin et al., 2013). ?18Ou also shows a 0.1 ‰ increase between 14.0 and 12.6 ka,, which 

can be related with the 1.5°C temperature decrease in Antarctica during the Antarctic Cold 

Reversal (14.6 to 12.65 ka, Figure 6.2, Blunier et al., 1997; Stenni et al., 2001).  

Foraminiferal calcite ?13C usually reflects a combination of several factors, markedly 

the ones related to nutrient cycling and isotopic fractioning at the oceanic surface due to air-

sea CO2 exchange (?
13Cas, see subsection 4.2.4). Biological primary production in the 

euphotic zone concentrates 12C in organic matter, enriching superficial water in 13C. Deeper in 

the water column, the 12C-rich organic matter is oxidized and remineralized, adding carbon 



 
 
 

50 

with low ?13C to deep waters (Duplessy et al., 1984). Air-sea fractionation at cold 

temperatures cause 13C enrichment in seawater, while warmer temperatures lead to 13C 

isotopic depletion and reduced ?13Cas values (Mook et al., 1974). Also, for comparisons 

between the LGM and modern ?13C values Duplessy et al. (1988) calculated an 0.3 ‰ ?13C 

depletion during the glacial for the whole ocean. Peterson et al. (2014) updated this number to 

0.38 ‰ and suggested that this global oceanic water ?13C decrease during the last glacial 

period was likely due to terrestrial carbon transfer to the deep ocean as originally proposed by 

Shackleton (1977)  

Curry and Oppo (2005) at 27ºS and during the LGM, characterized GAAIW as a high-

nutrient water mass with ?13Cc values between 0.3 and 0.5‰. Makou et al. (2010) combined 

the ?13Cc from Curry and Oppo (2005) with Cd/Ca measurements and calculated the 

atmospheric contribution to GAAIW ?13C (?13Cas) as 0.23‰ (between 899 and 1108 water 

depth) during the LGM, which would represent between 45% and 75% of the total GAAIW 

?13C signal. Makou et al. (2010) also noted that there was a steeper gradient between GAAIW 

and SACW than with GNAIW, suggesting a greater degree of mixing with the deeper water 

mass. Correspondent core top data presented ?13Cas of 1.22‰, which implied that GAAIW 

apparently had a significantly lower air-sea fractioning contribution in comparison to the 

modern AAIW (Makou et al., 2010). Other results from the Pacific and Indian sectors of 

GAAIW, however, exhibited much higher ?13Cas values than the ones observed in the 

Atlantic, suggesting enhanced ventilation of GAAIW in those regions during the LGM 

(Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1994; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1996; Muratli et al., 2010). This apparent 

contradiction led Makou et al. (2010) to hypothesize that connectivity between the different 

sections of the Southern Ocean was restricted during the LGM and that their calculated 

GAAIW ?13Cas values were specific to the South Atlantic. Later on Huang et al. (2014) used 

?Nd from unclean foraminifera, from a marine sediment core section at 10?N, to infer 

decreased latitudinal extent of GAAIW and increased mixture between GAAIW and GNAIW 

during the northern hemispheric cold periods HS1 and YD. The combination between their 

?Nd and 
231Pa/230Th (McManus et al., 2004) showed that the decreased GAAIW latitudinal 

extent was associated with decreased AMOC strength, which therefore gave support for 

decreased GAAIW ventilation during the LGM and potential ventilation seesawing between 

Pacific and Atlantic sectors of GAAIW (Makou et al., 2010).

from 1 to 4 are highlighted with gray rectangles (Sarnthein et al., 2000). Expected range of ?13C values (0.3-0.5‰ for GAAIW during the 

LGM, Curry and Oppo, 2005) are marked with a light blue rectangle. 



 
 
 

52 

Our ?13Cc composite data are consistent with GAAIW ?
13C expected values for the 

LGM (between 0.3 and 0.5 ‰, Curry and Oppo, 2005; Figure 6.3). Notable exceptions, when 

?13Cc was not between the 0.3 to 0.5‰ range, were during HS4, HS3 and before HS1. 

Between 37.6 and 41 ka, within the HS4 defined time range (Sarnthein et al., 2000), ?13Cc 

values were relatively higher (~0.65 ‰), which could be explained by several hypothesis: 

diminished productivity above in the water column, mixture with the higher ?13C bearer 

GNAIW, or a general increased air-sea fractionation and 13C-enrichment in GAAIW at its 

formation zone, because of decreased temperatures and/or decreased wind mixing. For this 

work we have not analyzed planktic foraminifera, which would allow us to check for the 

possible productivity decrease during HS4 in the photic zone, so this possibility can only be 

resolved with future analysis. The Antarctic temperature composite temperature (Figure 6.2c, 

(Parrenin et al., 2013) shows that during the HS4, temperatures actually increased in 

Antarctica, deeming unlikely that the ~0.15 ‰ ?13Cc increase (in relationship to 0.5‰ in ?
13Cc 

during the LGM and at 27?S, (Curry and Oppo, 2005) was associated to increased air-sea 

fractioning at GAAIW’s formation zone.  

Centered at 30.2 ka, within the HS3 time window (Sarnthein et al., 2000), ?13Cc was 

again higher than the LGM expected range (~ 0.57 ‰). Assuming that HS4 and HS3 ?13Cc 

increases were both due to the same process, recognizing the lack of productivity data from 

planktic foraminifera, as well as an unlikely ?13Cas enrichment during both HS, lead us to 

suggest that our ?13Cc increases were due to higher mixture between southern and northern 

component waters. This higher mixture rate implies decreased GAAIW formation at SH high 

latitudes and is supported by reported decreased AMOC strength during NH cold events 

(Makou et al., 2010; Böhm et al., 2015; see Figure 2.4).  

Lower than expected ?13Cc values between 20 and 18 ka could indicate increased 

productivity in the photic zone and 12C-rich detritus rainfall to the bottom of the water 

column, which should be tested by future analysis in planktic foraminifera. Additionally, 

given that the three samples available for this interval are a mixture of Cibicidoides species 

(Cibicidoides spp.) any interpretation using our ?13Cc record during this period (20 to 18ka) 

should consider possibly unaccounted species-specific offsets effects. In addition, the closest 

?13Cc available data, from marine sediment core KNR159-105JPC (27.35? S / 46.63? W / 1108 

m water depth; Curry and Oppo, 2005), does not support a regional productivity increase 

(Figure 6.3 and other ?13Cc data from the Brazil Margin transect; Curry and Oppo, 2005; 



 
 
 

53 

Makou et al., 2010; Tessin and Lund, 2013). The ?13Cc ~ 0.6 ‰ increase during HS1 began 

between 18 and 17 ka, in accordance with other published data in the Brazil Margin (Tessin 

and Lund, 2013). This long standing ?13Cc increase is probably related to the combination of 

several factors, among them increased mixture with higher ?13C waters (related with AMOC 

quasi-halt during HS1; McManus et al., 2004; Böhm et al., 2015), increased atmospheric 

pCO2 at the formation zone of GAAIW (Marcott et al., 2014; Bereiter et al., 2015) and 

isotopic adjustment for the global oceanic water ?13C increase since the last glacial (Peterson 

et al., 2014). 

There have been several suggestions that AAIW/GAAIW could have been a carrier for 

14C and 13C-depleted abyssal waters that contributed for global 40 ppm CO2 rise during the 

“Mystery Interval” (~17.5 to 14.5 ka; Broecker and Barker, 2007; Marchitto et al., 2007). 

Sortor (2012) investigated the ?14C of GAAIW during the deglaciation and found however 

that it followed the atmospheric trend, excluding Atlantic section of GAAIW as a possible 

carrier for the 14C-depleted carbon that contributed for the large atmospheric warming during 

HS1 (Broecker and Barker, 2007; Parrenin et al., 2013). 

U. peregrina ?13C (?13Cu) are usually of difficult interpretation because the assessment 

of its metabolic effects (i.e., species specific offset) in the ?13C signal is hampered by the 

dominance of locally specific environmental factors, including gradients between ?13CDIC and 

CO3
2- in pore water and near-surface sediment, controlled by remineralization of organic 

matter (McCorkle et al., 1990; Schmiedl et al., 2004). Zahn et al. (1986) showed that ?13C 

values for U. peregrina and C. wuellerstorfi did not run parallel over the past glacial-

interglacial cycles, which was also described in several other studies (e.g., Elmore et al., 

2015). Species of the Cibicidoides genera usually live on top of the sediment (epibenthic), 

thereby accurately recording the conditions of the bottom water. Species of the Uvigerina 

genera, however, live in the sediment (endobenthic) and its ?13C signal usually reflects the 

conditions of the pore water, strongly influenced by the sedimentation of organic substance, 

rather than the true bottom water (Zahn et al., 1986). Therefore, U. peregrina ?13C cannot be 

adjusted to C. wuellerstorfi, the most reliable benthic recorder of bottom water ?13CDIC 

(Duplessy et al., 1984; Schmiedl and Mackensen, 2006) by any constant which is generally 

valid through glacial and interglacial times. Elmore et al. (2015) calculated the offset between 

U. peregrina and Cibicidoides ?13C (??13C) within the Pacific sector of GAAIW and 

concluded that it amounted to ~0.6‰ during interglacials and ~1.4‰ during glacials (?offset = 



 
 
 

54 

0.8‰ between glacials and interglacials), values which are consistent with our own data (see 

section 5.2) .  

Nevertheless, our high-resolution ?13Cu record present good visual agreement with 

long term trends observed in the ?13Cc composite (Figure 6.3).  On millennial time scales 

however, ?13Cu is decoupled from ?
13Cc and do not show clear evidence of specific 

oscillations that could be related with possible HS3 and HS4 AMOC decreased strength 

(Böhm et al., 2015). Hesse et al. (2014) summarized the magnitude of all known factors 

which influence ?13Cu and concluded that alkalinity, pH and productivity in the water column 

had less impact on ?13Cu than the water ?
13CDIC itself.  

Our high resolution ?13Cu record presents a striking resemblance with variations on the 

Antarctic atmospheric CO2 record (Bereiter et al., 2015), showing a 900 years delay (r
2=0.85 

between Antarctic atmospheric CO2 and our ?
13Cu, and r

2=0.95 when comparing Antarctic 

atmospheric CO2 with ?
13Cu on its age model minus 900 years; Figure 6.4). Its most notable 

feature is the 1.15 ‰ ?13Cu increase from 17 to 13 ka. Since U. peregrina is usually 

considered to reflect pore water geochemistry and our ?13Cc supports the interpretation that 

GAAIW strength oscillated with AMOC slowdowns (which do not seem to impact our ?13Cu), 

this resemblance creates a conundrum. We suggest that our ?13Cu is primarily recording the 

global oceanic 0.38 ‰ ?13CDIC decrease during glacial times (Duplessy et al., 1988; Peterson 

et al., 2014), in itself correlated with atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we suggest that the 

remaining ~0.77 ‰ (1.15 - 0.38 ‰ ) ?13Cu increase registered between 17 and 13 ka is related 

to pore water geochemistry oscillations induced by the glacial to deglacial oceanic chemical 

change (?offset = 0.9 ‰ between 20 and 12 ka, see section 5.2).  

Primarily the atmospheric CO2 rise, the pore geochemistry variables of which ?offset is 

consisted and the 0.38‰ global ocean carbon isotopic difference between glacial and 

interglacial are likely related by a causal link, which not necessarily would be the Antarctic 

CO2 rise itself (a 
13C-depleated carbon release from an abyssal oceanic source would also 

affect all of them, for example). However, the timing with which our ?13Cu rose implies that at 

least the Atlantic sector geochemical change between glacial and deglacial was almost 1 kyr 

later than the Antarctic CO2 rise. Our data therefore, in agreement with the findings of Sortor 

(2012), does not support 13C-depleated degassing from an Atlantic abyssal source.  



 
 
 

55 

Also, our results suggest that GAAIW ?13C changes potentially related with AMOC 

slowdowns did not impact pore water geochemistry at our study site. However we allow that 

our interpretations require further study to be confirmed. Next steps could be investigating 

other proxies, such as ?13C of planktic foraminifera and Cd/Ca, to distinguish between 

paleoproductivity and ?13Cas variations in our ?
13Cc and ?

13Cu records.

7. Conclusions / Conclusões 

? AMOC slowdown potentially led to warming of GAAIW during HS3, which 

can be explained by long term accumulation of heat in the Southern Ocean 

during decreased AMOC strength scenario, which is supported by Cibicidoides 

?13C record, or due to warming of GAAIW at its area of formation.  

? During HS4, AMOC slowdown may have led to increased mixture between 

GAAIW and GNAIW.  

? We have no sign of an abyssal 13C-depleted carbon release in intermediate 

waters of western South Atlantic during the deglaciation.

South American summer monsoon decreased intensity related to the Bølling-Allerød 1 

interstadial  2 

Abstract 3 

The last deglaciation was marked by large-scale and rapid changes in rainfall over 4 

the tropics. Previous studies have correlated pulses of increased terrigenous input off semi-5 

arid northeastern South America with abrupt cold events in the high latitudes of the 6 

Northern Hemisphere. However, deglacial climate changes in other areas of South America 7 

are still not resolved. Here we reconstruct deglacial (23-11.5 cal ka BP) continental 8 

conditions over eastern Brazil based on (i) Ti/Ca of a radiocarbon dated marine sediment 9 

core as a proxy for Doce River (draining eastern Brazil) terrigenous input, and (ii) ?18O of a 10 

suite of U-Th dated stalagmites from eastern Brazil. Our marine core was recovered from 11 

1100 m water depth on the tropical Brazilian continental slope, while our stalagmites come 12 

from Lapa Sem Fim Cave. Both the Doce River and Lapa Sem Fim Cave are located in the 13 

highly populated and economically active eastern Brazil, where most of the rainfall is 14 

related to the activity of the South American Monsoon System (SAMS). The Ti/Ca record 15 

is relatively stable, showing high proportions of Ti in relationship to Ca throughout the 16 

deglacial, with a major excursion towards lower values, indicating a decrease in terrigenous 17 

input, synchronous to the Bølling–Allerød. Interestingly, speleothem ?18O also displays this 18 

major excursion, by recording less negative values. Together, our results suggest a major 19 

decrease in precipitation, likely related to a weakening of the SAMS. We further compared 20 

our results with the output of the SYNTRACE run of the CCSM3 fully-coupled climate 21 

model with transient forcing for the last deglaciation. Geochemical records and model 22 

output show consistent results and suggest that eastern Brazil experienced the driest period 23 

of the whole last deglaciation during the Bølling–Allerød and that this dry spell was indeed 24 

related to a decreased SAMS intensity. 25 

  26 



1. Introduction 27 

Heinrich stadials (HS) impacted continental tropical climates mainly through 28 

changes in intensity of monsoon systems. In South America (SA), during these events, a 29 

significant decrease in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) shifted the 30 

Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) location southwards, strengthening the South 31 

American Summer Monsoon (SASM) (Wang et al., 2004). Modeling efforts are consistent 32 

with the hypothesis that AMOC variations, and their effect on heat transport, hemispheric 33 

SST patterns, and ITCZ position, can be invoked to explain the strong covariation observed 34 

between Greenland and Cariaco Basin proxy records (e.g., Chiang and Friedman, 2012; 35 

Hughen et al., 1996; L. C. Peterson et al., 2000).  36 

In Brazil, the first study on the impact of millennial-scale abrupt events was (Arz et 37 

al., 1999; 1998), based in terrigenous input and planktonic foraminifera ?18O off NE Brazil. 38 

They showed increased terrigenous input during Heinrich events due to a southward shift of 39 

the ITCZ. Terrigenous materials deposited off tropical and subtropical eastern SA are 40 

delivered to the ocean via fluvial pathways, which are highly sensitive to climate change 41 

(Zhang et al., 2015). High concentrations of terrigenous elements and low calcium 42 

concentrations along the tropical and subtropical South American continental margins 43 

reflect the dominance of terrigenous input in these regions (Govin et al., 2012). Since Arz 44 

et al. (1998), a number of studies have used major element composition of marine sediment 45 

cores to trace changes in terrigenous input into the Atlantic (Arz et al., 1999; 1998; Bender 46 

et al., 2013; Chiessi et al., 2010; 2009; Govin et al., 2014; Haug et al., 2001; Jaeschke et al., 47 

2007; L. C. Peterson et al., 2000; Stríkis et al., 2015; Voigt et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). 48 

Yet, the 23-7ºS sector of the Brazilian continental margin remains completely void of 49 

studies. This is a particularly relevant sector of the continental margin for reconstructing the 50 

strength of the SASM and the South American Convergence Zone (SACZ), the transient 51 

convective system that transports Amazon moisture to central and southeastern SA (Figure 52 

2) (Vera et al., 2006). 53 

Within the continent, stalagmite ?18O records from caves in southeastern SA related 54 

negative ?18O excursions with intensification in the SASM during Heinrich events (Cruz et 55 

al., 2006; Stríkis et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2007).  56 

Here we use two previously unpublished data sets to discuss how global abrupt 57 



climate change events impacted central eastern South American climate during Termination 58 

1. We combine a detailed stalagmite ?18O record from central South America with XRF-59 

scanner and EDP-XRF data from a marine sediment core collected from the adjacent 60 

western tropical South Atlantic, as well as with the output from a transient forcing model 61 

run to reconstruct continental climate conditions. Our records show that abrupt temperature 62 

oscillations in Greenland during the Bølling-Allerød (BA) (Rasmussen et al., 2006) 63 

happened synchronously to changes in hydrological patterns in central South America. 64 

Moreover, the Bølling and Allerød events were related to decreased intensity of the SASM, 65 

separated by a brief wetter excursion, recognized as equivalent to the Older Dryas.  66 

2. Regional setting 67 

In this paper we present a record of major elements from marine sediments from the 68 

western South Atlantic and a speleothem stable isotope record from eastern South America. 69 

The marine site is located 105 km from the modern Brazilian coastline and 110 km of the 70 

current mouth of the Doce River, while the stalagmites used here were collected at Lapa 71 

Sem Fim Cave (Figure 1). 72 

Terrigenous sediment at the marine core site (Figure 1) have been directly delivered 73 

by the Doce River (Tintelnot, 1995; Tintelnot et al., 1998) during Late Pleistocene, when 74 

the river’s mouth was located beyond the shelf break, locally between 60 and 70 m water 75 

depth (Bastos et al., 2015). Nowadays, most of the terrigenous material from the Doce 76 

River is deposited at the continental shelf, but under pleistocenic low sea-level conditions, 77 

the terrigenous sediment was transported to the study site via one of the presently-drowned 78 

channels of the Doce River Canyon System (Figure 1 inset) (Brush et al., 2004; Maia, 79 

2013; Schreiner et al., 2009). Connections between the modern Doce River and the several 80 

incised valleys which constitute the Doce River Canyon System have been previously 81 

suggested in the scientific literature (Alves, 1999; A. M. C. França, 1979; M. C. França et 82 

al., 2015; Maia, 2013), and at the mid-continental slope of the Abrolhos Bank and Doce 83 

River shelf Massé et al. (1996) and Tintelnot (1995) registered high kaolinite contents, 84 

connected with the eastern and southeastern Brazilian rivers’ mineralogical signature. 85 

The Doce River Basin (Figure 1) is an important medium sized drainage basin in 86 



eastern Brazilian coastal zone (de Oliveira et al., 2012; Marques et al., 2004) with area of 87 

86.715 km2 (http://www.cbhdoce.org.br/; Souza and Knoppers, 2003) constituting the 88 

second largest drainage basin in eastern Brazil. The Doce River originates in the 89 

mountainous hinterland, over 1300m of altitude (i.e., Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra do 90 

Espinhaço) and throughout its 850km course crosses the crystalline Precambrian basement, 91 

covered by a thick weathered mantle, and the Tertiary coastal iron-rich sediments of the 92 

Barreiras-Formation (Carmo and Vasconcelos, 2004; Gunnell, 1998). 93 

The Doce River drainage basin is under a hot and humid tropical climate with 94 

marked rainy summer and dry fall-winter seasons (Cwb, Cwa and Aw Köppen-Geiger 95 

climate types, Peel et al., 2007). This seasonality is due to the SASM and SACZ activity, 96 

and average precipitation in the basin is 1400 mm/a with at least 80% falling during the 97 

rainy season (October to March). Exceptionally, in areas close to the coast, rains are 98 

distributed throughout the year, with austral winter rainfall brought by extratropical 99 

cyclones (Garreaud et al., 2009). The Doce River discharge follows the rainfall pattern and 100 

is strongly seasonal varying from 500 m3/s, from May to October, to 1300 m3/s, from 101 

November to April (source: www2.ana.gov.br, runoff measurements from the Colatina 102 

Water Station, located 90 km from the river mouth). 103 

The outer shelf and the upper 600 m of the water column over the continental slope 104 

are occupied by the Brazil Current (BC) (Figure 1). Starting around 10oS, the BC originates 105 

from the South Equatorial Current as a relatively weak western boundary current (R. G. 106 

Peterson and Stramma, 1991; Stramma and England, 1999) and transports Tropical Surface 107 

Water (TSW) and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) southwards (da Silveira et al., 108 

2000; Stramma and England, 1999).  109

the Brazilian Geological Service (CPRM, http://geobank.cprm.gov.br/).  

http://www.gebco.net/


The interaction of the BC, the morphological barrier of the broad and shallow 113 

Abrolhos Bank and the Vitória-Trindade Ridge characterize the surface hydrography in the 114 

study area. (Summerhayes et al., 1976) showed that surface temperatures and productivity 115 

on the shelf edge are affected by upwelling of SACW during austral summer. Further on, 116 

data from surface drifters revealed the unexpected oceanographic complexity of the region, 117 

affected by the temporal occurrence and migration of the Vitória Eddy (Schmid et al., 118 

1995). Consequently, the Doce River Shelf presents special conditions, where local land 119 

input and upwelling of relatively nutrient-rich SACW at the shelf edge are significant 120 

factors influencing the local sedimentation and primary production (Ekau and Knoppers, 121 

1996; Knoppers et al., 1999; Summerhayes et al., 1976).  122 

Between 600 and 1200m, the Intermediate Western Boundary Current transports 123 

Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the underlying Upper Circumpolar Deep Water 124 

(UCDW) equatorwards (da Silveira et al., 2004; Schmid et al., 1995).  125 

Lapa Sem Fim Cave (Figure 1) developed in low metamorphic grade limestones of 126 

the Bambuí Group (de Almeida et al., 1976), close to center of the modern NW-SE axis of 127 

the SACZ (Carvalho et al., 2004) (Figure 2), where precipitation occurs almost exclusively 128 

during the active phase of the SASM (e.g., (Vera et al., 2006). 129 

The modern climate outside of the cave is tropical semihumid (Aw, Köppen-Geiger 130 

climate type, Peel et al., 2007) with mean annual precipitation around 950 mm 131 

(http://www2.ana.gov.br) and rainfall concentrated in the austral summer (90% of total 132 

rainfall amount is recorded from October to March). Once the monsoon season ends, 133 

rainfall virtually ceases.  134 

The SASM starts in October, has its most active phase between December and 135 

February, and demise in April (e.g.,(Marengo et al., 2001; Raia and Cavalcanti, 2008). 136 

SASM intensity is mainly influenced by insolation, which is modulated by precession and 137 

excentricity in orbital timescales, and ITCZ dynamics in millennial to seasonal timescales. 138 

Higher (lower) insolation over the Southern Hemisphere (SH) strengthens (weakens) the 139 

monsoon system by increasing (decreasing) the land-sea thermal gradients, and ITCZ 140 

positioning is linked to moisture availability to SASM. Nowadays the Atlantic section of 141 

ITCZ migrates seasonally reaching its northernmost location, 10°N, in August and 142 

southernmost, 1°S, in March (mean latitudes at longitude 30°W, (Nobre and Shukla, 1996), 143 



Nevertheless, it has been suggested that during abrupt cooling events in the Northern 144 

Hemisphere it migrated further southward of the Equator, with increased moisture influx to 145 

SASM related to southward shifts on ITCZ (Deplazes et al., 2013; L. C. Peterson et al., 146 

2000; Stríkis et al., 2015).  147 

The SASM pathway to central and southeastern SA follows the SACZ NW-SE axis 148 

(Figure 2). The latter is defined as a transient convective system characterized by a 149 

nebulosity band formed by transport of Amazon moisture via low level jets to central and 150 

southeastern South America (SA) (Vera et al., 2006). SACZ is evident year round but more 151 

intense during austral summer, when it is connected with the area of convection over the 152 

central part of the continent, and produces episodes of intense rainfall over much of its 153 

NW-SE axis (Figure 2) (Liebmann et al., 1999).  154

3. Materials and methods 155 

3.1 Materials 156 

The investigated marine gravity core GeoB3228-1 (19°45’36” S, 38°45’36” W, 157 

1095 mbsl, 567 cm total length) was retrieved from the Brazilian continental slope during 158 

RV Victor Hensen cruise JOPS II, leg 8 (Pätzold et al., 1996) (Figure 1). One-meter-long 159 

sections of core GeoB3228-1 were longitudinally split and described, and then stored at 4oC 160 

at the GeoB Core Repository, MARUM-Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, 161 

University of Bremen. Visual core inspection revealed that it is composed mostly of olive 162 

gray mud with no (visual) evidence of disturbance within the discussed interval (158 cm to 163 

308 cm, (Pätzold et al., 1996). Syringe samples (10 cm3) were collected from the working 164 

halves at specific depths for AMS 14C and EDP-XRF analyses. 165 

The stalagmites used in this study, namely LSF15, LSF16 and LSF03, were 166 

collected from Lapa Sem Fim Cave (16°08’52’’S, 44°36’38’’W), located in central-eastern 167 

Brazil. The stalagmites were then cut along their growth axis and stored in the Laboratory 168 

of Karstic Systems, Geoscience Institute, University of São Paulo. Visual inspection 169 

revealed that all three stalagmites are composed of clear and milky white calcite with 170 

visible growth layers. Carbonate sampling for isotopic analysis was done with a Sherline 171 

5400 microsampler coupled with a digital ruler, allowing up to 0.4 mm resolution.  172 

3.2 Age models 173 

The age model of marine sediment core GeoB3228-1 was established based on five 174 

AMS 14C analyses spaced between 22 and 50 cm from each other (Table 1). The sample’s 175 

preparation was executed in the Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology Laboratory (P2L) 176 

at the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities of the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and 177 

consisted in drying the marine sediment (50?C maximum oven temperature), soaking in a 178 

beaker with water overnight, wet sieving over &gt;125µm and &gt;63µm combined meshes, 179 

rinsing both fractions with Milli-Q water and final drying (50?C maximum oven 180 

temperature) of the residues. After these steps, both fractions (&gt;125 µm and between 125 181 

µm and 63 µm) were stored in glass vials and labeled. For each sample, 10 mg of tests of 182 

planktic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerinoides sacculifer were selected 183 



for AMS 14C dating from the &gt;125 µm fraction under a binocular microscope. For the 184 

sample located at 308 cm core depth tests of these species did not amount to 10 mg and the 185 

required mass was completed with tests from other shallow-dwelling planktic foraminifera 186 

available. 187 

Radiocarbon analyses were performed at the Beta Analytic Laboratory, Miami, 188 

USA or at Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory, Poznan, Poland. Raw radiocarbon ages were 189 

calibrated for the reservoir effect (Bard, 1988; Franke et al., 2008) and for variations on the 190 

original 14C concentration in the atmosphere (Reimer et al., 2013) using the online software 191 

Calib 7.0.2 (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and the Marine13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 192 

2013). All ages are indicated in calibrated years before present (cal kyr BP, here shortened 193 

as ka, where present is 2000 A.D.). The age model is based on linear interpolation between 194 

calibrated radiocarbon ages (i.e., interpolated from the 2? ranges) for the entire record. 195 

For the age model of the Lapa Sem Fim isotopic record, between 100 and 120 mg of 196 

speleothem carbonate (depending on U concentration) have been dated by U-Th method 197 

using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique at the University of 198 

Minnesota, USA, following the procedures described by (Shen et al., 2002). All of the total 199 

26 datings yield errors&amp;lt;1% (Table 1), and of these, 14 had already been published by 200 

(Stríkis et al., 2015). The age model was linearly interpolated between U-Th ages for the 201 

entire record. 202 

3.3 Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca in bulk sediments of GeoB3228-1 203 

Ti, Fe and Ca counts were determined at 5 mm intervals with 20 seconds of 204 

irradiation time directly over the pristine archive halves of the core, using a X-ray 205 

fluorescence (XRF) Core Scanner II (AVAATECH Serial No. 2, 10kV, and 0.35 mA) at the 206 

MARUM – Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen, Germany. 207 

Prior and after daily analysis, the instrument was calibrated against a set of pressed powder 208 

standards (Jansen et al., 1998). Acquired XRF spectra were processed with the WinAxil 209 

and WinBatch software packages. The resulting data were expressed as element intensities 210 

in counts per second. 211 

Subsequently, 10 discrete samples taken every 17 cm, on average, were freeze-212 

dried, powdered and homogenized with an agate mortar, and had Ti, Fe and Ca 213 



concentrations measured on an energy dispersive polarization X-ray fluorescence (EDP-214 

XRF) spectrometer (Panalytical Epsilon 3X). We assessed the analytical quality of the 215 

measurements by repeated analyzes of several different certified standard reference 216 

materials (e.g. MAG-1; Govindaraju et al., 1994). The measured values were within 1% of 217 

accepted values. The standard deviation of replicated sediment samples was less than 2%. 218 

Elements concentrations are expressed in grams per kilogram of dry sediment. 219 

The EDP-XRF absolute concentrations were used to calibrate the scanner XRF 220 

intensities into calibrated proportions using the regression method described by (Weltje and 221 

Tjallingii, 2008). The calibrated curve was then also expressed in grams per kilogram of 222 

dry sediment. 223 

3.4 Oxygen isotopes from Lapa Sem Fim stalagmites 224 

Calcite powder (~200 ?m) was analyzed with an on-line, automated carbonate 225 

preparation system (Finnigan Gas Bench) linked to a Finnigan Delta Plus Advantage mass 226 

spectrometer at the Laboratory of Stable Isotopes, University of São Paulo, Brazil. The 227 

produced oxygen isotope ratios were corrected using a linear regression curve constructed 228 

using analysis results of four different standards: IAEA-CO-8, NBS18, NBS19 and REI, 229 

the in house standard. REI and samples were analyzed sequentially on a 1 to 6 ratio. The 230 

analytic precision of oxygen isotopic ratios is ?0.1‰ and values are reported as ?18O 231 

relative to the Vienna Peedee Belemnite standard. For clarity, on the comparison with 232 

Ti/Ca ratios, we interpolated the original data for every 65 yrs (the lowest sampling 233 

resolution throughout the three stalagmites) using the integrated interpolation function of 234 

software AnalySeries version 2.0.8 (Paillard et al., 2011). Since LSF16 and LSF15 are 235 

joined at a sensitive period for our discussion, we show their overlapping signal between 15 236 

and 14.5 ka. LSF16 and LSF03 were joined using their signals overlap as tie point, at 17.33 237 

ka.  238 



4. Results 239 

4.1 Age models 240 

Gravity core GeoB3228-1 age model (Figure 3a) show an apparently continuous 241 

sedimentation from 12.30 ka downwards. The sedimentation rates are high, 35 and 20 242 

cm/kyr, between the beginning of the record (23 ka) and 18.35 ka and lower (~8 cm/kyr), 243 

but stable, between 18.35 ka and the end of the record at 12.30 ka.  244 

Depths and U-Th datings, an important contribution to this work is the robust 245 

chronological control of our Lapa Sem Fim (LSF) speleothem record, from the stalagmites 246 

LSF15, LSF16 and LSF03 were combined in a composite record (Figure 3b). The LSF03 247 

age model section was established with 7 ages and covers the interval from 22.86 until 248 

17.34 ka. The LSF16 age model section was produced with 10 ages spanning from 17.29 ka 249 

until 14.53 ka. The LSF15 age model section is based on 8 ages straddling from 15.21 ka 250 

until 12.13 ka. The LSF composite growth rate averaged 10.58 cm/kyr and varied from 1.54 251 

cm/kyr between 20.46 ka and 19.35 ka within LSF03 to 77 cm/kyr between 14.75 ka and 252 

14.53 ka within LSF16. At the same period, LSF15 presented an average of 7.7 cm/kyr. 253

4.2 Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca in bulk sediments of GeoB3228-1 258 

Our 5 mm step XRF measurements yielded 335 measurements in total with 259 

temporal resolution between 14 and 61 yrs (33 yrs on average). Also on average the 260 

proportion by weight between Fe : Ti : Ca on GeoB3228-1 was 0.63 : 0.07 : 1.  261 

EDP-XRF calibrated ln(Ti/Ca) and ln(Fe/Ca) records show virtually identical 262 

curves for the whole record (23.00 to 12.30 ka) (Figure 3). Elemental ratios remain 263 

relatively high between the beginning of the record at 23.00 ka and 15.93 ka, forming a 264 

plateau interrupted only by 3 excursions to lower values ranging from 400 to 800 yr in 265 

duration (centered at 20.08, 18.37 and 16.38 ka). After 15.93 ka, ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca) 266 

begin a steady decrease, briefly interrupted at 15.67 ka, until 15.23 ka after which they 267 

show a slight increase. At 14.92 ka, ln(Fe/Ca) and ln(Ti/Ca) sharply resume the decreasing 268 

trend until 13.69 ka, when they reach minimum values. From 13.69 ka onwards, elemental 269 

ratios increase towards plateau values until the end of the record. Since ln(Fe/Ca) and 270 

ln(Ti/Ca) present virtually identical records, we decide to use only ln(Ti/Ca) for the 271 

discussion.   272 

4.3 Oxygen isotopes from Lapa Sem Fim stalagmites 273 

Our isotope record is composed of 840 ?18O values, yielding a temporal resolution 274 

between 3 and 65 yrs (15 yrs on average). The ?18O signal averaged -6‰ through the whole 275 

studied period (23 to 12.30 ka) and oscillated with amplitude of 5.9‰. It is worthy of note 276 

that the ?18O data from LSF16 and part of LSF03 (up until 19.35 ka) was originally 277 

published by (Stríkis et al., 2015).  278 

The LSF composite ??18O begins at 22.86 shows -6 ‰ at the base of the record, 279 

trending toward less negative values until 21.35 ka, after that values stabilize around -5 ‰ 280 

for 1.1 kyr and sharply increase at 20.22 ka and remain around -4 ‰ for ~400 years . At 281 

19.83 ka ??18O values decrease to -6 ‰ and oscillate around that value for 700 years. At 282 

19.14 ka isotopic values increase 1 ‰ on a less negative excursion that lasted 800 years 283 

until 18.29 ka, when??18O values gradually resume decreasing. From 18.11 ka onwards the 284 

record is composed by two consecutive double-plunged shapes. The oldest, between 18.11 285 

to 14.7 ka, characterized by isotopic values oscillating from -8.6 ‰ and -6 ‰ is interrupted 286 



by a lasting less negative excursion centered at 16.38 ka (when values reached ~ -6.5 ‰) 287 

and a briefer one centered at 17.19 ka (Stríkis et al., 2015). The youngest double-plunged 288 

structure on the isotopic record ranged from 14.7 ka and 12.58 ka with values oscillating 289 

from -6.8  ‰ and -2.8 ‰. The latter was interrupted by a more negative excursion around 290 

14.00 ka. 291

5. Discussion 293 

5.1 Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca in bulk sediments of GeoB3228-1 294 

Fe and Ti within marine sediment cores can be used as tracers of the siliciclastic 295 

components of terrestrial sediments, and vary proportionally to the terrigenous fraction, 296 

whereas Ca is largely derived from biogenic CaCO3 shell material (i.e., mostly pteropods, 297 

foraminifera, and calcareous nannoplankton) (Govin et al., 2012). Elemental ratios 298 

including Ca (e.g., Fe/Ca) are sensitive to dilution effects (i.e., enhanced biological 299 

productivity, carbonate dissolution), which can affect reconstructions of terrestrial climate. 300 

Nevertheless, in our record, post depositional carbonate dissolution and/or overgrowth were 301 

not observed and could be ruled out, validating the use of Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca to discuss 302 

marine versus terrigenous input as described below.  303 

We assume that Ca fluxes remained relatively constant throughout the recorded 304 

period. Only a few studies investigated changes in paleoproductivity in the oligothrophic 305 

western South Atlantic Ocean (i.e., Mahiques et al., 2007; Nagai et al., 2010; Toledo, 2008; 306 

Toledo et al., 2007). Toledo (2008) developed their work in an area affected by the Cabo 307 

Frio upwelling system (Mahiques et al., 2005) and the changes in productivity were mainly 308 

attributed to increased/decreased upwelling, which do not necessarily correspond to oceanic 309 

conditions in our study area. Mahiques et al. (2007) and Nagai et al. (2010) found increased 310 

productivity during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 23 to 19 ka, Mix et al., 2001)  and 311 

relatively stable paleoproductivity values during Termination 1. Even during the LGM our 312 

Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca log ratios remained stable, which led us to assume that possible 313 

productivity changes during our our studied time window did not affect our signal.  314 

Sea level rise, however, appears to have modulated our signal. Each of the 315 

progressively younger decreases in ln(Ti/Ca) has a higher amplitude in relationship to the 316 

previous one, consistent with progressive distancing of the river mouth from the study site 317 

due to sea level rise. Between 23 and 12 ka, sea level rose around 65m globally (e.g., 318 

Lambeck and Chappell, 2001), with the highest sea level change rates occurring during 319 

Melt Water Pulse 1A (MWP1A, Deschamps et al., 2012). MWP1A began at ~14.65 ka and 320 

was synchronous to the onset of the BA. At ~14.7 ka, there is indeed a sharp decrease in 321 

our Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca records (Figure 4).  322 



Previous works have used Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios to trace changes in terrigenous 323 

input of fluvial origin of South American rivers, particularly offshore the semiarid 324 

northeastern Brazil, where repeated authors pointed out increases in the terrigenous input 325 

during Heinrich events due to southward shifts of the ITCZ (Arz et al., 1999; 1998; 326 

Jaeschke et al., 2007; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Nace et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015).  327 

In comparison to these studies though, we observe a different trend in our data. The 328 

noticeable features of our records are the lower terrigenous excursions centered at 20.08, 329 

18.37, 16.38, 15.23 and 13.65 ka representing decrease in terrigenous input to the basin, 330 

which translate into dry periods in the catchment area and decreased Doce River runoff.  331 

Curiously, Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca remained stable even during time windows when we would 332 

expect SASM related terrigenous input to increase (e.g., Stríkis et al., 2015). This can be 333 

tentatively explained by three hypotheses, explored on subsection 5.3. 334 

The most prominent features observed in our curves is by far the long standing 335 

decrease in Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca between 15.5 ka and 12.5 ka, which starts before the BA (at 336 

14.7 ka) and ends with ratios increasing again almost to plateau values during the Younger 337 

Dryas (YD).  338 

5.2 ?18O in stalagmites from Lapa Sem Fim Cave 339 

Speleothem ?18O in tropical and subtropical lowlands is usually interpreted as a 340 

precipitation proxy, indicating changes in precipitation source (Cruz et al., 2006; 2005) 341 

and/or amount (Bony et al., 2008; Risi et al., 2008). The first imply that moisture becomes 342 

progressively impoverished in 18O as further away from its source it travels, and the second 343 

describes the negative correlation between monthly rainfall amount and monthly weighted 344 

mean ?18O. Given that in the LSF area 90% of the annual precipitation is related to SASM 345 

activity, negative (positive) anomalies in ?18O from LSF stalagmites have been interpreted 346 

to reflect increases (decreases) in precipitation, that, in turn, are related with higher (lower) 347 

intensity of the SASM (Stríkis et al., 2015; 2011).  348 

Based on this assumption, our ?18O signal shows neither too wet nor too dry 349 

conditions between 23 and 18.1 ka. The most remarkable feature during this period being a 350 

drier excursion between 20.64 and 20.13 ka (which is also related with the smallest growth 351 

rate in our record, the 1.54 cm/kyr between 20.43 and 19.35 ka).  352 



Between 14.7 ka and 13.15 ka, the LSF15 ?18O signal can be divided in three phases 353 

representing two drier excursions separated by a relatively wet one, correspondent to the 354 

Bølling (14.7 - 14.13 ka), Older Dryas (14.13-13.86 ka) and Allerød (13.86 – 13.15 ka) 355 

periods, in chronological order (period names according to Mangerud et al., 1974). On 356 

LSF15 between 13.15 and 12 ka, ?18O are more negative, pointing to SASM intensification 357 

right before and during the YD. It is worthy of note that the LSF record presented here is 358 

the most detailed record describing precipitation changes within the Bølling–Allerød 359 

interstadial in South America. 360 

5.3 Integrating elemental ratios and stable isotopes  361 

LSF ?18O records 8 excursions toward less negative values that are synchronous to 362 

decreases on Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca from GeoB3228-1 (with the exception of one, at 17.20 ka) 363 

(Figure 5). This confirms that excursions toward less negative values on our speleothem 364 

record are connected with runoff decrease in the Doce River Basin, as shown by the 365 

decreases on Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca. Since over 80% of the rainfall on the Doce River basin and 366 

Lapa Sem Fim Cave is brought by SASM, we interpret that during these periods the 367 

monsoon intensity was weakened, likely connected with decrease in moisture influx caused 368 

by relatively northward positioning of the ITCZ.  369 

However, the inverse seems not to be valid, i.e., excursions toward more negative 370 

?18O values on LSF are not related to increased Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca log ratios on GeoB3228-1. 371 

There are two possibly related hypotheses to explain this apparent mismatch, each 372 

involving one of our proxies. 373 

First, decreases in stable isotopes ratios in speleothems formed under ideal 374 

conditions (i.e., calcite crystallization in isotopic equilibrium with drop water isotopic 375 

content) are produced by the amount effect (i.e., 18O impoverishment on rainfall moisture 376 

linearly correlated with the amount of rainfall (Bony et al., 2008; Risi et al., 2008)) over the 377 

karstic system or along the moisture path since its departure from the reservoir, which is 378 

primarily the ocean. Hence, calcite isotopic composition is not necessarily only a recorder 379 

of precipitation amount over the cave itself, as the moisture can have been depleted 380 

progressively and unequally along its pathway from the reservoir. In this scenario, 381 

increased precipitation over the Amazon due to southward ITCZ shifts would already 382 



transmit 18O-poor moisture to areas under SACZ influence without necessarily increasing 383 

rainfall amount over the cave.  384 

 385 

Second, different weathering patterns and sediment transport between densely 386 

vegetated tropical eastern SA and the semiarid areas should also be considered. As 387 

mentioned above, previous studies that assessed shifts in precipitation and the related 388 

changes in Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca were carried out off northeastern Brazil (Arz et al., 1998; 389 

Jaeschke et al., 2007; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Nace et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). That 390 

area is characterized by semiarid climate (Bsh, Köppen-Geiger climate type, Peel et al., 391 

2007) which favor a fast response of the terrigenous input to oceanic basins for several 392 

reasons. As the countryside is usually hot and dry, the landscape is dominated by relatively 393 

sparse savanna vegetation (Cole, 1960; Machado et al., 1997) and shallow rock-soil 394 

interface (Bétard et al., 2007). Under these conditions, abrupt floods or increased rainfall 395

amount can easily transport weathered material to the ocean, increasing Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca 396 

ratios in case of wetter conditions. Inversely, the humid climate of the Doce River Basin 397 

favors the development of thick weathering profiles and well developed tropical vegetation. 398 

In this scenario, weathering profiles are better fixated and to some extent protected from 399 

erosion thus, characterizing a vegetational buffer to terrigenous input to the ocean caused 400 

by precipitation increase. The inverse, decrease of rainfall, naturally leads to decreased 401 

river runoff and terrigenous material transport, in accordance with both our records (Figure 402 

5). 403 

Relying on either one of these hypotheses does not affect our conclusions, that 404 

central eastern SA experienced extremely drier than average conditions at specific periods 405 

during Termination I and LGM, most prominently during the BA. We suggest that these 406 

drier periods were related to weakened intensity of SASM. 407 

5.4 The Bølling-Allerød interstadial in South America 408 

A northward shift of the ITCZ during the BA (see Deplazes et al., 2013) and 409 

references therein) would have decreased the moisture influx to the SASM, decreasing also 410 

its intensity and, consequently the amount of precipitation in our study area.  411 

We further compared our Ti/Ca and ?18O records with the output of the 412 

SYNTRACE run of the CCSM3 fully-coupled climate model with transient forcing for the 413 

last deglaciation or Termination I (45°W to 37°W, 20°S to 13°S, Liu et al., 2009) (Figure 414 

6a). In this simulation, the HS1 increase in precipitation over the region of the Rio Doce 415 

Basin was relatively smaller than the abrupt decrease due to the onset of the BA. Also, in 416 

agreement with our results, the BA was the driest period within 23 and 12 ka. The model, 417 

however, does show the earlier transition to drier conditions in the end of HS1 and before 418 

the BA, as shown by Ti/Ca ratios in our marine sediment core. We assume this happens 419 

because the model was elaborated mainly with Northern Hemispheric forcings (Liu et al., 420 

2009) that exclude the regional variations which can have caused such earlier SASM 421 

intensity decrease in the end of the HS1. 422 

The marine sediment cores GeoB3129-1 and GeoB3911-3 (Arz et al., 1999; 423 

Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Weldeab et al., 2006) (Figure 6e), were collected off northeastern 424 

Brazil, where southward shifts of the ITCZ resulted in increased terrigenous input (Fe/Ca 425 



ratios). Fe/Ca composite from cores GeoB3129-1 and GeoB3911-3 show the same 426 

precipitation trend implied by LSF ?18O (Figure 6c) and similar to GeoB3228-1 Ti/Ca 427 

(Figure 6d) and Fe/Ca ratios. The HS1 structure described by (Stríkis et al., 2015) can also 428 

be recognized in the GeoB3129-1 / GeoB3911-3 Fe/Ca composite, showing a prominently 429 

wet HS1c, followed by a dry excursion compatible with HS1b, a brief return to wetter 430 

conditions in the beginning of the HS1a, followed by a transitional passage to drier 431 

conditions that remain during the BA. On both GeoB3228-1 and GeoB3129-1 / GeoB3911-432 

3 Fe/Ca composite the beginning of the Bølling period is indistinguishable from the end of 433 

HS1a. The Fe/Ca increase (on GeoB3129-1/GeoB3911-3 composite) at 14 ka is relatable 434 

with the LSF ?18O decrease between Bølling and Allerød periods, possibly explainable by a 435 

brief southward shift of the ITCZ during the Older Dryas cold period in the Northern 436 

Hemisphere. This southward shift would have briefly intensified SASM, reflecting as more 437 

negative ?18O values on our Lapa Sem Fim Cave composite and not being recorded in our 438 

marine sediment core due to the intrinsic characteristics of Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios from 439 

Doce River basin, already discussed in the previous subsection.   440 

On GeoB3228-1 Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios, the 14.7 ka abrupt decrease in the 441 

terrigenous input can be connected to either a rapid decrease in SASM intensity or the fast 442 

sea level rise during MWP1A (Deschamps et al., 2012).  443 

The comparison between precipitation estimations from SYNTRACE run of the 444 

CCSM3 (Liu et al., 2009), Fe/Ca from marine sediment cores GeoB3129-1 and GeoB3911-445 

3 (Arz et al., 1999; Jennerjahn et al., 2004; Weldeab et al., 2006) and our coupled 446 

GeoB3228-1 Ti/Ca and LSF ?18O allow us to confirm decreased SASM intensity in eastern 447 

SA during the BA, likely related to northward positiong of ITCZ and consequent reduced 448 

moisture influx to SASM.  449

6. Conclusion 451 

The 2 kyr long Bølling-Allerød interstadial had a clear impact in South American 452 

climate, leading to long standing dry conditions in central eastern South America. The 453 

markedly dry conditions during Bølling-Allerød interstadial are related to weakened 454 

intensity of the South American Summer Monsoon, likely caused by reduced moisture 455 

influx to the continent due to the contemporaneous northward shift of Intertropical 456 

Convergence Zone.  457
