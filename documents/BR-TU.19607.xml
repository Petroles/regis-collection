Porosos Cera?micos em LHP e CPL

Palavras Chave: Elemento Poroso Cera?mico, LHP, CPL, A?gua

Motivac?a?o

A indu?stria eletro?nica tem crescido a um ritmo acelerado visando a miniaturizac?a?o e
o melhor desempenho dos seus componentes. Em virtude desse crescimento, o controle
te?rmico de equipamentos eletro?nicos tem se tornado um assunto de importa?ncia para a
indu?stria de eletro?nicos. Existe atualmente uma necessidade para desenvolver dispositivos
de transfere?ncia de calor que sejam capazes de transferir grandes quantidades de calor a?
uma queda de temperatura m??nima. Neste contexto, os Heat Pipes (HP), os Loop Heat
Pipes (LHP) e os Capillary Pumping Loops (CPL) sa?o alternativas confia?veis e via?veis
para a dissipac?a?o de calor gerado. Eles sa?o trocadores de calor, que utilizam a evaporac?a?o
e condensac?a?o de um fluido de trabalho para transferir calor de forma mais eficiente. A
circulac?a?o de fluido e? realizada pelas forc?as capilares geradas em uma estrutura porosa.
Portanto, o bombeamento do fluido de trabalho na?o consome energia ele?trica. Nesta tese,
apenas os LHPs e o CPLs sera?o estudados.

Nas u?ltimas de?cadas, a aceitac?a?o destes sistemas na comunidade aeroespacial vem
crescendo devido a suas vantagens de desempenho, caracter??sticas u?nicas de funciona-
mento e ao sucesso obtido nos recentes experimentos testados no espac?o. Por con-
seque?ncia, as pesquisas te?m se intensificado a fim de compreender melhor os feno?menos
que ocorrem nestes sistemas te?rmicos. Ku &amp;amp; Kroliczek (1987), Maydanik et al. (1991),
Ku (1994), Maydanik (1999), Ku (1999), Nikitkin &amp;amp; Cullimore (1998), Chernysheva et al.
(2007), Santos &amp;amp; Bazzo (2007), entre outros, publicaram avanc?os passados e recentes na
pesquisa desses sistemas de controle te?rmico.

Objetivo

Os principais objetivos desta tese sa?o dois. O primeiro e? o desenvolvimento de um
modelo matema?tico para o problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa, que ocorre
dentro do meio poroso de evaporadores de sistemas de bombeamento capilar. O segundo
e? a aplicac?a?o de meios porosos cera?micos em sistemas de bombeamento capilar (LHPs e
CPLs) seguido pela avaliac?a?o de seus comportamentos te?rmicos durante a partida e em
condic?o?es de regime permanente. A?gua e acetona sa?o utilizados como fluidos de trabalho.

Introduc?a?o

Classificac?a?o e Operac?a?o Ba?sica dos CPLs e LHPs

Os CPLs e LHPs operam dentro de um intervalo de temperatura, basicamente, definido
pelas propriedades do fluido de trabalho. A escolha do fluido de trabalho envolve va?rios
fatores associados a? operac?a?o, disponibilidade e seguranc?a. A amo?nia e? frequ?entemente
usada em sistemas de bombeamento capilar, mas outros fluidos de trabalho, tais como
a?gua, etanol, acetona, propileno, metanol, butano, isobutano e propano tambe?m apre-
sentam um bom funcionamento (PETERSON, 1994). A faixa de temperatura de operac?a?o
determina a condic?a?o preliminar para a selec?a?o do fluido de trabalho para uma deter-
minada aplicac?a?o. A faixa ma?xima esta? compreendida entre os pontos triplo e cr??tico,
porque abaixo do ponto triplo e acima do ponto cr??tico na?o ha? circulac?a?o do fluido de
trabalho por ac?a?o capilar.

A capacidade de bombeamento capilar depende da tensa?o superficial do fluido de
trabalho e das propriedades do meio poroso. Ate? agora, os fluidos de trabalho foram
classificadas de acordo com o limite capilar, ou seja, de acordo com a pressa?o ma?xima de
bombeamento que o meio poroso pode prover. Existe outro limite chamado de limite de
ebulic?a?o, mas por falta de uma melhor estrate?gia, os fluidos que apresentam este problema
te?m sido evitados. O limite de ebulic?a?o esta? relacionado com o processo de evaporac?a?o
do fluido de trabalho no canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido e/ou no meio poroso devido
a? alta temperatura do l??quido que escoa atrave?s do evaporador. Ku (1994) estudou o
funcionamento de um CPL, baseando a sua ana?lise no diagrama de pressa?o e temperatura
(PT), e em suas concluso?es justifica a necessidade de um alto grau de sub-resfriamento
na entrada do evaporador capilar exigido por alguns fluidos de trabalho, tais como a?gua
e tolueno. Ou seja, quanto maior a exige?ncia de sub-resfriamento de um determinado
fluido de trabalho, menor o limite de ebulic?a?o. Uma ana?lise similar realizada para o LHP,
utilizando o diagrama PT, foi tambe?m publicada por Maydanik et al. (1991), Ku (1999)
and Maydanik (2005). A ocorre?ncia destes dois limites operacionais sera?o analisados neste
trabalho.

Os modos de operac?a?o dos sistemas de bombeamento capilar pode ser classificado
como conduta?ncia fixa ou varia?vel. No modo de conduta?ncia varia?vel, a temperatura de
saturac?a?o do sistema pode ser controlada para diferentes cargas te?rmicas. Por outro lado,
no modo de conduta?ncia fixa, quanto maior a carga te?rmica, maior sera? a temperatura
de saturac?a?o do sistema. Nikitkin &amp;amp; Cullimore (1998) apresentou gra?ficos qualitativos
da temperatura do vapor para um CPL e um LHP, ambos operando nos modos de con-
duta?ncia fixa e varia?vel. De forma semelhante, Chernysheva et al. (2007) apresentou
gra?ficos quantitativos para um LHP. A pro?xima sec?a?o resume os principais resultados das
recentes pesquisas desenvolvida envolvendo a aplicac?a?o dos sistemas de bombeamento
capilar (CPLs e LHPs) no controle te?rmico de equipamentos eletro?nicos em geral.

Revisa?o dos Experimentos Realizados com CPL e LHP

O controle te?rmico tem crescido em importa?ncia na indu?stria eletro?nica (computa-
dores modernos) devido a? cont??nua diminuic?a?o de tamanho e ao aumento na pote?ncia dos
seus componentes. De acordo com Nikitkin &amp;amp; Cullimore (1998) and Maydanik (2005), os
LHPs e os CPLs, que foram desenvolvidos anteriormente para o controle te?rmico aeroes-
pacial (sate?lites), sa?o alternativas confia?veis e via?veis para transferir calor em grandes



quantidades com alto desempenho tambe?m para aplicac?o?es em condic?o?es atmosfe?ricas.
Va?rios autores (CHEN; LIN, 2001; HOANG et al., 2003; PASTUKHOV et al., 2003; MAYDANIK,
2005; CHEN et al., 2006; PASTUKHOV; MAYDANIK, 2007) publicaram resultados experi-
mentais relativos a? aplicac?a?o dos LHPs, mini-LHPs e CPLs na dissipac?a?o de calor em
CPUs de computadores modernos, mostrando que eles sa?o trocadores de calor eficientes
e confia?veis para a pro?xima gerac?a?o de microprocessadores.

E? comum expressar a qualidade dos LHPs e CPLs atrave?s da resiste?ncia te?rmica R
(oC/W) dada por,

R =
?T

Q
,

onde Q e? a taxa de transfere?ncia de calor dissipada pelo sistema de bombeamento capilar
e ?T e? a diferenc?a de temperatura entre as fonte quente e fria.

O desempenho te?rmico e a confiabilidade dos LHPs e CPLs te?m sido extensivamente
estudados experimentalmente. Ku (1999), Chen &amp;amp; Lin (2001), Pastukhov et al. (2003),
Chuang (2003), Ku et al. (2004), Pastukhov &amp;amp; Maydanik (2007), Maydanik &amp;amp; Vershinin
(2009) analisaram a partida e o comportamento te?rmico dos sistemas de bombeamento
capilar (CPL e LHP) com relac?a?o a? raza?o de preenchimento do fluido de trabalho, a?
inclinac?a?o dos sistemas, ao material do meio poroso (n??quel, ac?o inoxida?vel, cobre, poli-
etileno), ao material do invo?lucro do evaporador (cobre e ac?o inoxida?vel), ao sistema de
refrigerac?a?o do condensador (a?gua e ar em convecc?a?o forc?ada e ar em convecc?a?o natural),
com multi-evaporadores e multi-condensadores. Os testes foram realizados em condic?o?es
atmosfe?ricas e de microgravidade para uma se?rie de cargas te?rmicas. Os resultados mais
recentes sa?o descritos a seguir.

Hoang et al. (2003) desenvolveram e testaram tre?s mini-LHPs que utilizavam propileno,
amo?nia e a?gua como fluidos de trabalho. Todos os LHPs foram assistidos por um sistema
de resfriamento secunda?rio na ca?mara de compensac?a?o a fim de diminuir a transfere?ncia
de calor da zona de evaporac?a?o para o canal de entrada de l??quido. Dois sistemas de res-
friamento na ca?mera de compensac?a?o foram testados: um sistema termo-ele?trico (TEC)
e um tubo de calor feito de cobre com 3 mm de dia?metro, que utilizava a?gua como fluido
de trabalho. Dois dos LHPs foram capazes de transportar calor ate? 60 W (amo?nia) e
15 W (propileno) a? temperatura ambiente de 25 oC. O LHP que utilizou a?gua (principal
objetivo do trabalho) foi testado com e sem o tubo de calor na ca?mara de compensac?a?o.
O LHP que utilizou a?gua foi feito de cobre e o meio poroso foi feito de teflon com dia?metro
de poro de 7 µm e permeabilidade de 1 × 10?13 m2. Este LHP foi capaz de transportar
calor ate? 220 W a? uma temperatura de operac?a?o de 82 oC com o tubo de calor na ca?mara
de compensac?a?o e 90 oC sem o tubo de calor. A resiste?ncia te?rmica total variou de 2, 0
a 0, 2 oC/W. A utilizac?a?o do tubo de calor na ca?mara de compensac?a?o teve uma grande
influe?ncia na capacidade de transfere?ncia de calor dos LHPs.

Seis mini-LHPs foram desenvolvidos e testados por Pastukhov et al. (2003) para o res-
friamento de componentes eletro?nicos e processadores de computadores porta?teis. Amo?nia
e acetona foram utilizadas como fluido de trabalho. Meios porosos feitos de ac?o inoxida?vel
e tita?nio foram utilizados como estruturas porosas. O ar foi usado em convecc?a?o forc?ada
para o resfriamento do condensador e do dia?metro dos evaporadores cil??ndricos variou de
5 a 6 mm. Os LHPs foram capazes de transportar calor ate? 40 W com resiste?ncia te?rmica
total variando de 1, 0 a 2, 4 oC/W. A temperatura do processador se manteve entre 83
e 90 oC. Eles conclu??ram que uma maior diminuic?a?o da resiste?ncia te?rmica total deve



ser obtida pela otimizac?a?o do projeto do LHP e do resfriamento do condensador. Eles
mostraram ainda que a amo?nia apresentou melhores resultados quando comparado com
os resultados obtidos usando acetona.

Chen et al. (2006) realizaram uma se?rie de testes com um mini-LHP, o qual foi de-
senvolvido para refrigerac?a?o de CPUs de computadores porta?teis. Amo?nia foi utilizada
como fluido de trabalho e o material do meio poroso foi feito de tita?nio com raio de poro
de 17, 2 µm, porosidade de 78% e permeabilidade de 11, 5 × 10?12 m2. Eles testaram o
mini-LHP em diversas posic?o?es (na horizontal, condensador acima do evaporador, evapo-
rador acima do condensador, ca?mara de compensac?a?o acima do evaporador e evaporador
acima da ca?mara de compensac?a?o), com destaque para a posic?a?o com o evaporador acima
do condensador em 10o e vice-versa. O comportamento te?rmico do mini-LHP foi avali-
ado durante a partida do sistema e para diferentes temperaturas do banho termosta?tico
utilizado no condensador. A? temperatura do banho de 25 oC e na posic?a?o horizontal, o
mini-LHP foi capaz de transportar calor ate? 70 W a uma temperatura de operac?a?o limite
de 80 oC e a resiste?ncia te?rmica total variou de 0, 2 a 0, 85 oC/W. Eles conclu??ram que o
mini-LHP testado na posic?a?o horizontal operou de maneira satisfato?ria.

Maydanik &amp;amp; Vershinin (2009) desenvolveram e testaram nove mini-LHPs com eva-
poradores capilares cil??ndricos. Tre?s mini-LHPs tinham dia?metros externos de 5 mm e
seis mini-LHPs tinham dia?metros externos de 6 mm. Eles utilizaram amo?nia como fluido
de trabalho para todos os mini-LHPs e materiais diferentes para o meio poroso (tita?nio,
com raios me?dios de poro de 9, 5 e 17, 2 µm e porosidades de 70 e 78%, e n??quel com
raios me?dios de poro variando entre 13, 5 e 10, 0 µm e porosidades de 71, 66 e 65%). Os
invo?lucros dos evaporadores cil??ndricos foram feito de tita?nio e n??quel. Va?rios testes foram
realizados com o objetivo de avaliar o comportamento te?rmico dos mini-LHPs levando em
considerac?a?o a inclinac?a?o dos dispositivos, a temperatura de resfriamento na sec?a?o do
condensador e o tipo de fluido utilizado para o resfriamento do condensador (ar e a?gua
em convecc?a?o forc?ada). Eles apresentaram uma metodologia para estimar as resiste?ncias
te?rmica e os coeficientes de transfere?ncia de calor dos mini-LHPs. As resiste?ncias te?rmicas
m??nimas foram 0, 53 oC/W e 0, 14 oC/W para o resfriamento do condensador com ar e
com a?gua, respectivamente. A capacidade ma?xima foi de 230 W para o resfriamento do
condensador com a?gua.

Como demonstrado, a maioria dos meios porosos foram feitos de metais ou pol??meros.
No entanto, esses materiais apresentam algumas dificuldades de usinagem (meios porosos
meta?licos) e uma baixa capacidade de bombeamento capilar (meios porosos de pol??mero).
A usinagem dos meios porosos meta?licos pode obstruir os poros na superf??cie, diminuindo,
desta forma, a permeabilidade do meio poroso. A pro?xima sec?a?o apresentara? alguns tra-
balhos nos quais foram realizadas a produc?a?o, a caracterizac?a?o e a aplicac?a?o de meios
porosos em sistemas de bombeamento capilar.

Aplicac?a?o de Meios Porosos Cera?micos em Sistemas de Bombeamento
Capilar

Embora a capacidade de transfere?ncia de calor dos LHPs e CPLs seja alta, a produc?a?o
complicada desses dispositivos e? ainda uma desvantagem. A montagem adequada da
estrutura capilar no interior do invo?lucro do evaporador e? o primeiro desafio a ser superado.
A montagem e? relativamente complexa, porque para o bom funcionamento do evaporador
capilar se requer um micro-espac?amento entre as paredes internas do invo?lucro meta?lico
e a superf??cie externa do meio poroso. Este espac?amento deve ser adequado a fim de



minimizar a resiste?ncia te?rmica e qualquer vazamento de vapor do evaporador para a
ca?mara de compensac?a?o (LHP) ou para o canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido (CPL). A fim
de se obter esses micro-espac?amentos, um processo de usinagem confia?vel e? necessa?rio para
as estruturas porosas meta?licas, porque ha? a possibilidade de obstruc?a?o dos poros na sua
superf??cie devido a? deformac?a?o pla?stica. Os meios porosos cera?micos na?o apresentam essa
deformac?a?o pla?stica durante a usinagem. Portanto, eles podem ser usinados utilizando
ma?quinas convencionais (JANSSEN et al., 2008).

De acordo com o conhecimento do autor desse trabalho, existem poucos sistemas de
bombeamento capilar usando meios porosos cera?micos (RASSAMAKIN et al., 2002; RHI,
2006). A maioria dos LHPs e CPLs usam meios porosos de polietileno ou de metal.
Espera-se que os meios porosos cera?micos se tornem mais vantajosos porque eles sa?o
menos onerosos e de fa?cil usinagem, pois na?o corre o risco de obstruir os poros da superf??cie
externa da estrutura por deformac?a?o pla?stica. Ale?m disso, a baixa condutividade te?rmica
pode minimizar a transfere?ncia de calor radial para o canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido,
evitando que o limite de ebulic?a?o seja atingido.

Reimbrecht (2004) desenvolveu uma metodologia para a fabricac?a?o de meios porosos
para aplicac?a?o em sistemas de bombeamento capilar. Va?rias te?cnicas - ana?lise de imagem,
porosimetria atrave?s da intrusa?o de mercu?rio e outros me?todos experimentais - foram
empregadas para determinar as propriedades esta?ticas e de transporte dos meios porosos
estudados. Ele produziu meios porosos meta?licos (n??quel e ac?o inoxida?vel) e cera?micos.

Camargo (2004) testou e analisou todos os meios porosos fabricado por Reimbrecht
(2004) em CPLs. Duas bancadas experimentais foram constru??das para avaliar os CPLs
produzidos. Ele testou os CPLs com acetona e amo?nia como fluido de trabalho. Os
resultados apresentados por Camargo (2004), mostraram que o CPL com o meio poroso
cera?mico obteve sucesso na partida apenas para a carga te?rmica de 10 W, entretanto ele
na?o operou de forma esta?vel. Ale?m disso, o CPL com o meio poroso cera?mico apresentou
os piores resultados de desempenho quando comparados com os outros meios porosos
testados (n??quel, ac?o inoxida?vel e polietileno).

Berti (2008) fabricou e testou dois CPLs que utilizaram acetona como fluido de tra-
balho. Um CPL testado utilizava um meio poroso cera?mico fabricado por colagem por
barbotina, que operou com uma carga te?rmica de 40 W (3.93 W/cm2). O outro CPL tes-
tado que utilizava tambe?m um meio poroso cera?mico, mas que foi fabricado por biomode-
lagem, operou com uma carga te?rmica de 20 W (11.32 W/cm2). Os CPLs funcionaram de
forma satisfato?ria, pore?m Berti (2008) relatou que ele teve muitos problemas em relac?a?o a?
montagem do evaporador capilar e a? transfere?ncia de calor atrave?s da parede do evapora-
dor para o canal de alimentac?a?o de l??quido, devido a? geometria usada para os evaporadores
capilares planos.

A sec?a?o seguinte apresentara? uma breve revisa?o bibliogra?fica dos modelos matema?ticos
propostos para resolver o problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa em evaporadores
capilares.

Descric?a?o e Revisa?o do Problema

O principal componente de sistemas de bombeamento capilar (CPL e LHP) e? o evapo-
rador capilar. Durante a operac?a?o dos evaporadores capilares, calor e? aplicado a superf??cie
externa do evaporador e do fluido de trabalho dentro do meio poroso muda de fase. O
vapor gerado no evaporador escoa atrave?s das ranhuras. A evaporac?a?o do fluido de tra-



balho dentro dos evaporadores capilares depende da carga te?rmica aplicada ao sistema e
pode ocorrer em tre?s regimes distintos: (1) evaporac?a?o em microfilme (2), evaporac?a?o na
superf??cie externa do meio poroso e (3) evaporac?a?o dentro do meio poroso.

A incerteza com relac?a?o a? localizac?a?o da frente de evaporac?a?o e a? determinac?a?o dos
limites capilares para a operac?a?o do meio poroso te?m motivado tentativas para se re-
solver o problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa em meios porosos de sistemas de
bombeamento capilar. Alguns dos modelos teo?ricos sa?o analisados a seguir.

Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a) estudaram a evaporac?a?o em meios porosos supondo condic?o?es
de contornos restritivas, que, no entanto, resultou em soluc?o?es anal??ticas para os campos
de velocidade e temperatura. Eles assumiram que o meio poroso estava completamente
saturado de l??quido e a frente para a evaporac?a?o estava localizada na superf??cie externa.
Seu modelo tambe?m assume que o campo de velocidade e? uniforme na entrada de l??quido
e na sa??da de vapor. Eles fizeram uma ana?lise parame?trica direcionada, principalmente,
para mostrar que a sua soluc?a?o anal??tica e? precisa para a maioria das aplicac?o?es. Eles
conclu??ram que os resultados obtidos sa?o de releva?ncia para o projeto de evaporadores
capilares.

Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994b) publicaram uma extensa?o de seu trabalho anterior fazendo uma
ana?lise da geometria tridimensional. Um estudo nume?rico foi desenvolvido para estudar
o fluxo do l??quido atrave?s do meio poroso (bidimensional) e o fluxo de vapor atrave?s
das ranhuras (tridimensional). Uma comparac?a?o entre os resultados e? apresentada para
tre?s fluidos de trabalho (a?gua, freon e amo?nia). Em ambos os trabalhos publicados por
Cao e Faghri, eles afirmam que os resultados obtidos sa?o de releva?ncia para o projeto de
evaporadores capilares, pore?m eles na?o apresentam um crite?rio para a secagem do meio
poroso, ou seja, eles na?o determinam qual seria o fluxo de calor cr??tico antes da falha do
evaporador capilar.

Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994) realizou uma ana?lise teo?rica sobre o problema da trans-
fere?ncia de calor e de massa em meios porosos de um sistema de bombeamento capilar.
Em seu modelo, o l??quido dentro do meio poroso muda de fase, desenvolvendo uma regia?o
de vapor saturado separada da regia?o de l??quido saturado por uma frente de evaporac?a?o.
Sa?o aplicadas as equac?o?es de conservac?a?o da massa e da energia na frente de evaporac?a?o.
A pressa?o capilar tambe?m e? modelada nesta frente. Uma soluc?a?o nume?rica do mod-
elo matema?tico permitiu estudar o deslocamento da frente de evaporac?a?o em func?a?o da
variac?a?o da carga te?rmica aplicada ao sistema.

Eles assumiram que duas condic?o?es limites sa?o fisicamente poss??vel. Para fluxos de
calor baixos, existe uma pequena regia?o de vapor saturado abaixo da aleta e ocorre a
formac?a?o de meniscos de liquido na interface meio poroso-aleta. Toda a evaporac?a?o do
fluido ocorre na interface entre o meio poroso e a ranhura. Com o aumento do fluxo de
calor, o l??quido evapora no menisco e a evaporac?a?o passa a ocorrer tanto na regia?o de
vapor saturado quanto na interface da ranhura.

A evaporac?a?o no menisco e? modelada assumindo um coeficiente global de transfere?ncia
de calor que inclui uma resiste?ncia te?rmica condutiva atrave?s do filme l??quido. A trans-
fere?ncia de calor por conduc?a?o na aleta tambe?m e? resolvida. Seus resultados mostraram
que a evaporac?a?o e? muito mais intensa na interface meio poroso-ranhura do que na frente
de evaporac?a?o. Isso ocorre porque o fluxo de vapor fora da regia?o abaixo da aleta e?
dificultada pelo baixo valor da viscosidade cinema?tica do vapor, em comparac?a?o com a
viscosidade cinema?tica do l??quido. Os autores apresentam bons resultados, entretanto eles
tambe?m na?o determinam o valor cr??tico de fluxo de calor para a transic?a?o entre as duas



condic?o?es limites estudadas. Somente uma ana?lise qualitativa e? apresentada.

Figus et al. (1999) analisaram um problema semelhante e eles tentaram quantificar
a mudanc?a entre os regimes de evaporac?a?o em func?a?o da variac?a?o do fluxo de calor.
Eles consideraram que a frente de evaporac?a?o estava localizada dentro do meio poroso.
Foram aplicados dois tratamentos diferentes: modelo do cont??nuo, semelhante ao usado
por Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994), e modelo de rede de percolac?a?o de poros, semelhantes
aos modelos desenvolvidos anteriormente por Prat (1993, 1995) e Laurindo &amp;amp; Prat (1996).

Figus et al. (1999) apresentaram soluc?o?es para um meio poroso com condutividade
te?rmica efetiva baixa (?s = 4 W/m-K) e para um outro meio poroso com condutividade
te?rmica efetiva alta (?s = 10 W/m-K). Para o meio poroso com condutividade te?rmica
baixa, os resultados mostraram que quando o tamanho dos raios dos poros e? constante
e igual a 10µm, a frente de evaporac?a?o invade o meio poroso apenas para um fluxo de
calor q?? &gt; 4.500 W/m2. As soluc?o?es do problema podem ser bem determinadas atrave?s
do modelo do cont??nuo ate? o fluxo de calor ma?ximo de 90.000 W/m2.

Na soluc?a?o obtida com o modelo de rede de percolac?a?o de poros para o meio de
maior condutividade te?rmica e com raza?o entre o tamanho de poro ma?ximo e m??nimo
de R = dmax/dmin = 2, a frente de evaporac?a?o invadiu o meio poroso para um fluxo de
calor de q?? = 1.000 W/m2. Acima deste valor, a frente se desenvolveu com uma superf??cie
irregular. Entre os fluxos 15.000 e 35.000 W/m2, a frente de evaporac?a?o se manteve esta?vel
dentro do meio poroso. Acima do fluxo de calor de 35.000 W/m2, a a?rea da frente de
evaporac?a?o aumentou progressivamente ate? a falha do sistema no fluxo de q?? = 200.000
W/m2.

Embora Figus et al. (1999) na?o tenham correlacionado o limite para a falha do meio
poroso, eles mostraram claramente a tende?ncia do processo de invasa?o da frente de eva-
porac?a?o no meio poroso.

Takahashi (2002) analisou a transfere?ncia de calor e de massa no meio poroso de um
evaporador capilar a fim de determinar o fluxo de calor ma?ximo antes de sua falha por
limite capilar. Takahashi assumiu, como Figus et al. (1999), que a frente da evapora-
c?a?o estava imersa no meio poroso. Ele resolveu numericamente o problema usando o
me?todo de volumes finitos em coordenadas curvil??neas ortogonais. Ele usou um me?todo
de rastreamento da frente evaporac?a?o combinado com uma malha mo?vel. Ele analisou a
amo?nia como fluido de trabalho e obteve as propriedades para o meio poroso de n??quel
fabricado por Reimbrecht et al. (1999). Ele apresentou os resultados referentes a? loca-
lizac?a?o da frente de evaporac?a?o para diferentes fluxos de calor. Os valores dos fluxos
de calor cr??ticos foram calculados para diferentes propriedades (fluxo de calor ma?ximo
de 13, 06 × 104 W/m2 para um funcionamento em regime permanente), mas nenhuma
tentativa foi feita para a parametrizac?a?o dos resultados obtidos.

Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006) estudaram numericamente a transfere?ncia de calor e de massa
na estrutura porosa de um LHP, visando a ocorre?ncia do limite de ebulic?a?o. O problema
foi basicamente o mesmo estudado por Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994) e Figus et al. (1999)
com uma formulac?a?o semelhante. Uma diferenc?a na formulac?a?o foi que o modelo leva em
conta os termos convectivos da equac?a?o da conservac?a?o da energia. No entanto, como
mostrado por Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a), a contribuic?a?o desses termos pode ser negligenciada.

A modelagem apresentada por Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006) permite a estabilizac?a?o da frente
de evaporac?a?o, tanto na superf??cie externa quanto no interior do meio poroso. Depois que
a frente invade o meio poroso, formando uma regia?o de vapor saturado abaixo da aleta,
os autores consideram que o salto de pressa?o atrave?s da interface deve ser menor do que



a pressa?o capilar e na?o exatamente igual, tal como exigido pelo equil??brio termodina?mico
numa interface curva l??quido-vapor. Essa violac?a?o na?o se justifica.

Ale?m disso, os autores precisam ainda especificar um superaquecimento da superf??cie
na interface meio poroso-aleta necessa?rio para criar uma regia?o de vapor saturado. Eles
assumiram que, se temperatura da superf??cie da aleta for maior do que temperatura de
saturac?a?o do fluido a? pressa?o de entrada de l??quido em 4 oC, a frente evaporac?a?o entra no
meio poroso. Percebe-se que este crite?rio e? arbitra?rio, uma vez que na?o inclui o tamanho
dos poros local, o que modificaria o equil??brio termodina?mico local, e essa condic?a?o pode
mudar dependendo do fluido, do grau de pureza dele, da rugosidade da superf??cie e da
te?cnica de montagem. Portanto, os resultados apresentados por Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006)
na?o sa?o confia?veis com relac?a?o ao limite para a formac?a?o da regia?o de vapor saturado
abaixo da aleta.

Ate? o momento, percebe-se que ha? uma falta de informac?a?o sobre a localizac?a?o da
frente de evaporac?a?o, ou seja, qual seria o fluxo de calor ma?ximo para o qual o meio poroso
pode suportar antes que a frente de evaporac?a?o passe da superf??cie externa para o interior
do meio poroso. Como mencionado anteriormente, a frente da evaporac?a?o pode estabelecer
uma posic?a?o esta?vel dentro do meio poroso, mas essa condic?a?o deve ser evitada. Assim,
o modelo aqui desenvolvido permite determinar quando a frente de evaporac?a?o invade o
meio poroso. Ao contra?rio do crite?rio assumido por Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006), neste modelo
um crite?rio confia?vel e? assumido com relac?a?o ao fluxo de calor cr??tico com base na pressa?o
ma?xima capilar que o meio poroso pode suportar. No presente modelo, as condic?o?es
de contorno assumidas por Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a, 1994b) sa?o melhoradas para melhor
representar a f??sica do problema.

Em relac?a?o aos testes experimentais, a maioria dos LHPs e CPLs utilizam meios
porosos feitos de metal e amo?nia como fluido de trabalho. As poucas aplicac?o?es de meios
porosos cera?micos em LHPs e CPLs na?o obtiveram sucesso. Portanto, nesta trabalho e?
realizado um estudo experimental do comportamento te?rmico de dois LHPs e de um CPL
que utlizam meios porosos cera?micos e a?gua como fluido de trabalho.

Resultados e Ana?lise

Foram fabricados e testados dois LHPs, um utilizando acetona e o outro a?gua como
fluidos de trabalho. Os testes foram realizados para pote?ncias de ate? 25 W. Ale?m disso,
foi fabricado e testado um CPL usando a?gua. Os testes do CPL foram realizados para
pote?ncias de ate? 30 W. O meio poroso cera?mico utilizado possui 50% de porosidade,
distribuic?a?o de raio de poro entre 1 e 3 µm e uma permeabilidade de 1.5 × 10?14 m2.
Considerando uma temperatura de operac?a?o limite de 100 oC e regime permanente, os
LHPs foram capazes de transferir ate? 15 W para a?gua e 25 W para acetona, enquanto
que o CPL foi capaz de transferir ate? 30 W. Apesar do bom desempenho dos sistemas
de bombeamento capilar avaliados, observou-se que mais pesquisas ainda sa?o necessa?rias,
buscando otimizar as propriedades termof??sicas do meio poroso cera?mico e melhorar o
projeto dos LHPs e do CPL.

A qualidade dos sistemas de bombeamento tem sido comumente expressa pela re-

siste?ncia te?rmica total (Rtotal =
?T

Q
), no entanto, percebe-se que Rtotal e? dependente do

tamanho do sistema, ou seja, na?o leva em conta a a?rea do evaporador onde a taxa de
transfere?ncia de calor e? aplicada. Assim, uma figura de me?rito diferente e? aqui proposta,



R
??

total =
?T

q
?? ,

onde: q
??

e? o fluxo de calor dissipado pelo sistema de bombeamento capilar e ?T =
TEvap ?THS e? a diferenc?a de temperatura entre a superf??cie quente, onde a carga te?rmica
e? aplicada, e o banho te?rmico no condensador.

A Fig. 1 apresenta os resultados obtidos com Rtotal e R
??

total. Percebe-se atrave?s da
Fig. 1(b) que a R

??

total do CPL (a?gua) e? maior do que a R
??

total dos LHPs. De acordo com
os resultados obtidos com R

??

total, o LHP (acetona) funcionou melhor do que o CPL e o
LHP, ambos usando a?gua.

siste?ncia te?rmica total por cent??metro quadrado versus fluxo de calor para os LHPs e o
CPL testados.

As Figs. 2 e 3 apresentam uma comparac?a?o entre os resultados obtidos experimen-
talmente nesta tese e os encontrados na literatura para os CPL e LHPs, respectivamente.

(a) (b)

Figure 2 – (a) Resiste?ncia te?rmica total versus taxa de transfere?ncia de calor e (b) a
resiste?ncia te?rmica total por cent??metro quadrado versus fluxo de calor para o CPL.



Comparando o CPL testado neste trabalho com os encontrados na literatura, percebe-
se atrave?s da Fig. 2(a) que, de acordo com os resultados calculados atrave?s da Rtotal, o
CPL testado no presente trabalho apenas operou melhor do que os CPLs apresentados
por Wang et al. (2008) e por Camargo (2004) (elementos porosos cera?micos). Entretanto,
de acordo com os resultados calculados atrave?s da R

??

total e mostrados na Fig. 2(b), o CPL
testado no presente trabalho operou melhor do que os CPLs apresentados na literatura.

Percebe-se atrave?s dos resultados mostrados na Fig. 3 que apesar dos LHPs na?o
terem operado ta?o bem quanto os mini-LHPs, eles apresentaram resultados satisfato?rios.
Uma das razo?es para este resultado relativamente fraco, e? que os mini-LHPs encontrados
na literatura utilizaram amo?nia como fluido de trabalho que, devido a?s suas propriedades
te?rmicas, e? considerado o melhor fluido de trabalho para sistemas de bombeamento capilar.

(a) (b)

Figure 3 – (a) Resiste?ncia te?rmica total versus taxa de transfere?ncia de calor e (b) a
resiste?ncia te?rmica total por cent??metro quadrado versus fluxo de calor para os LHPs.

Uma comparac?a?o e? feita entre os resultados experimentais e teo?ricos As curvas do raio
me?dio cr??tico adimensional em func?a?o do fluxo de calor de entrada adimensional para um
meio poroso com uma ou duas camadas sa?o comparadas com o raio me?dio adimensional
do elemento poroso cera?mico testado neste trabalho para cada fluxo de calor aplicado aos
sistemas de bombeamento capilar (Fig. 4).

Figure 4 – Comparac?a?o entre os resultados experimentais e teo?ricos.



Percebe-se atrave?s da Fig. 4 que apenas o LHP (acetona) atingiu o limite capilar para
o meio poroso com uma camada. Apesar do LHP (acetona) ter atingido o limite capi-
lar, ele continuou operando para as taxas de transfere?ncia de calor de 20 e 25 W. Desta
forma, de acordo com o modelo (apresentado no Cap??tulo 2), a frente de evaporac?a?o in-
vadiu o meio poroso e encontrou uma localizac?a?o esta?vel dentro dele. No entanto, esta
comparac?a?o deve ser tomada apenas como uma primeira aproximac?a?o, uma vez que o
modelo teo?rico na?o reproduz completamente a geometria dos sistemas de bombeamento
capilar testados. No entanto, as tende?ncias f??sicas permanecem as mesmas.

Concluso?es e Recomendac?o?es para Trabalhos Futuros

Quanto a? modelagem do problema da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa em eva-
poradores capilares, um crite?rio confia?vel para o in??cio da secagem do meio poroso foi
determinado. Quanto ao desenvolvimento de evaporadores capilares de LHP e CPL, um
elemento poroso cera?mico foi proposto como uma alternativa aos elementos porosos feito
de metal e pol??meros. Estes evaporadores capilares testados operaram de maneira esta?vel
e confia?vel em ambos LHP e CPL.

Os resultados experimentais foram comparados com os resultados teo?ricos obtidos
com o modelo. Apenas o LHP (acetona) atingiu o limite capilar para o meio poroso
com uma camada. Apesar do LHP (acetona) ter atingido o limite capilar, ele continuou
operando para as taxas de transfere?ncia de calor de 20 e 25 W. Desta forma, de acordo
com o modelo (apresentado no Cap??tulo 2), a frente de evaporac?a?o invadiu o meio poroso
e encontrou uma localizac?a?o esta?vel dentro dele. No entanto, esta comparac?a?o deve ser
tomada apenas como uma primeira aproximac?a?o, uma vez que o modelo teo?rico na?o
reproduz completamente a geometria dos sistemas de bombeamento capilar aqui testados.
No entanto, as tende?ncias f??sicas permanecem as mesmas. Se um meio poroso com duas
camadas com condutividades te?rmicas diferentes for usado em vez de um meio poroso com
uma camada, foi observado que quanto maior a condutividade te?rmica abaixo da aleta,
maior o limite capilar.

Essas sa?o as principais sugesto?es para trabalhos futuros:

? Adaptar o modelo para a geometria cil??ndrica real dos evaporadores capilares tes-
tados.

? Projetar mini-LHPs e mini-CPLs a fim de aplica?-los em computadores porta?teis e
de mesa.

? Testar o LHP e o CPL em ambiente de micro-gravidade para aplicac?a?o aeroespacial.

? Produzir um meio poroso cera?mico com condutividade te?rmica maior.

Resumo

O controle te?rmico na indu?stria eletro?nica tem crescido em importa?ncia devido a?

cont??nua diminuic?a?o de tamanho e ao aumento na pote?ncia dos componentes. Nestas

aplicac?o?es, buscam-se dispositivos eficientes de transfere?ncia de calor, capazes de transferir

grandes cargas de calor com uma diferenc?a m??nima de temperatura. Neste contexto, os

tubos de calor (Heat Pipes - HPs), os tubos de calor em forma de circuito (Loop Heat

Pipes - LHPs) e as bombas capilares (Capillary Pumping Loops - CPLs) sa?o alternativas

confia?veis e via?veis para a dissipac?a?o de calor. Os evaporadores capilares da maioria dos

LHPs e CPLs utilizam meios porosos feitos de metal ou de pla?stico. Neste trabalho, um

meio poroso cera?mico e? proposto para aplicac?o?es em LHPs e CPLs. O desempenho do

meio poroso cera?mico como evaporador capilar e? analisado teo?rica e experimentalmente.

Primeiramente, e? feita uma ana?lise teo?rica da transfere?ncia de calor e de massa de um

evaporador capilar plano com uma estrutura porosa formada por uma ou duas camadas

com propriedades diferentes. O meio poroso tem formato de um disco e e? instalado entre

os canais de l??quido e de vapor. Um fluxo de calor externo e? aplicado a? superf??cie superior

da estrutura porosa onde ocorre a evaporac?a?o do fluido de trabalho. A transfere?ncia

de calor e de massa e? modelada usando as equac?o?es macrosco?picas de conservac?a?o da

Abstract

Thermal control has become a relevant issue for the electronic industry due to the

continuous decrease in size and increase in power of the electronic components. Heat

transfer devices capable of transferring large heat loads with a minimal temperature drop

are required. In this context, Heat Pipes (HPs), Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) and Capillary

Pumping Loops (CPLs) are reliable and feasible alternatives for heat dissipation. The

capillary evaporators of most LHPs and CPLs use porous wicks made of sintered metal

and plastic. A ceramic porous wick is proposed in this work as an alternative to wicks

made of these common materials for applications in LHPs and CPLs. A theoretical and

experimental analysis is presented. First, the heat and mass transfer in a flat capillary

evaporator formed by a single or double-layered porous wick is analyzed. The wick has a

shape of a flat disc and it is assembled between the liquid and vapor channels. An external

heat input is applied in the upper surface of the wick, where the working fluid evaporates.

The mass and heat transfer are modeled using the mass and energy macroscopic conser-

vation equations. The fluid is assumed incompressible, local thermal equilibrium prevails

and Darcy’s Law is used to model the viscous flow within the porous medium. The

models developed allow to verify the effect of design variables, such as working fluids,

dimensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal conductivity of the wick, in

the performance of the capillary evaporator. For the experimental analysis, performance

tests of two LHPs using acetone and water as working fluids were carried out for power

inputs up to 25 W and performance tests of one CPL using water were carried out for

power inputs up to 30 W. The ceramic porous wick used had 50% of porosity, 1 to 3

µm of pore radius distribution and a permeability of about 1.5 × 10?14 m2. Limiting the
operation temperature at 100 oC, at steady state, the LHPs were capable to transfer up

to 25 W using acetone and 15 W using water, and the CPL was capable to transfer up to

30 W. Despite the good performance of the LHPs and CPL tested, it was observed that

further research are still required for the optimization of the properties of the ceramic

porous wick and for improving the design of the LHPs and CPL.

1 Introduction

The electronics industry has grown at a rapid pace seeking the miniaturization and

better performance of components. At the scales reached nowadays, the thermal control

of electronic equipment has become an important issue. There is a need to develop heat

transfer devices that are capable of transferring large amounts of heat with a minimal

temperature drop. In this context, Heat Pipes (HP), Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) and Capil-

lary Pumping Loops (CPL) are reliable and feasible alternatives as heat transfer devices.

They are passive two-phase devices that utilize the evaporation and condensation of a

working fluid to transfer heat. The thermal fluid circulation is accomplished by the cap-

illary forces generated in a porous wick. Therefore, the working fluid pumping does not

consume electric power. In this thesis, the LHP and the CPL are studied.

In the last decades, there has been an increased acceptance of these systems in the

aerospace community because of their performance advantages, unique characteristics of

operation and the success in operation in recent flight experiments. As a result, research

has been intensified in order to better understand the phenomena that occur in these

thermal systems. Ku &amp;amp; Kroliczek (1987), Maydanik et al. (1991), Ku (1994), Maydanik

(1999), Ku (1999), Nikitkin &amp;amp; Cullimore (1998), Chernysheva et al. (2007), Santos &amp;amp;

Bazzo (2007), among others, report past and recent advances.

1.1 CPL and LHP Classification and Basic Operation

CPL and LHP operate within a range of temperatures basically defined by the work-

ing fluid properties. The choice of working fluid involves several factors associated to

the operation, availability and safety. Ammonia is frequently used in capillary pumping

systems but other working fluids such as water, ethanol, acetone, propylene, methanol,

butane, isobutene and propane also result in good operation (PETERSON, 1994). The

range of operation temperatures constitutes the preliminary condition for the selection of

the possible thermal fluid for a given application. The maximum range lies between the

triple and critical points, because below the triple point and above the critical point there

is no circulation of the thermal fluid by capillary action.



1 Introduction 2

The capillary pumping capacity depends on the surface tension of the working fluid

and the properties of the porous wick. Up to now, the working fluids have been classified

according to the capillary limit, i.e., the maximum pumping pressure that the porous wick

can provide. There is another limit called the boiling limit, but for lack of a better strategy,

the fluids that present this problem have been avoided. The boiling limit is related to

the evaporation process of the working fluid in the liquid feeding channel and/or in the

wick due to high temperature of liquid that flows into the evaporator. Ku (1994) studied

the operation of a CPL, basing his analysis on the Pressure-Temperature (PT) diagram

and his conclusions justified the need for a high state of subcooling in the entrance of the

capillary evaporator required by some working fluids such as water and toluene. That

is, the greater the subcooling requirement of a determined working fluid, the lower the

boiling limit. A similar analysis, using the PT diagram, was also published for LHP by

Maydanik et al. (1991), Ku (1999) and Maydanik (2005). The occurance of these two

operating limits will be analyzed in this work.

The operation modes of the capillary pumping systems can be classified as fixed or

variable conductance. In the variable conductance mode, the system saturation tempera-

ture can be controlled for different thermal loads. On the other hand, in the fixed conduc-

tance mode, the greater the thermal load, the greater the system saturation temperature.

Nikitkin &amp;amp; Cullimore (1998) presented qualitative graphs of the vapor temperature for

CPL and LHP operating in the fixed and variable conductance modes. Chernysheva et

al. (2007) presented similar quantitative graphs for LHP.

In the following, an overview of the CPL and LHP theory is presented. The fixed and

variable conductance modes and the PT diagrams for CPL and LHP are discussed.

1.1.1 CPL with Fixed Conductance

Figure 1.1 depicts a typical fixed conductance CPL. This device is composed of an

evaporator, a condenser, a subcooler and liquid and vapor transport lines. The evaporator

possesses a wick that promotes the working fluid circulation in the loop. The fluid circu-

lation occurs in a continuous way and in the same direction, differently of the circulation

in the heat pipe, where the liquid and the vapor flow in opposite directions.

Fixed conductance CPLs operate in the following way: heat is supplied to the evapora-

tor and the liquid into the wick evaporates, forming menisci at the liquid-vapor interface.

The capillary forces developed by the curvatures of the menisci promote the working fluid

circulation along the loop. The vapor formed in the capillary evaporator flows through

the vapor transport line to the condenser, where heat is removed. The liquid formed

in the condenser is subcooled before being transported back to the evaporator. All the

pressure losses in the system are supplied by the capillary pressure difference originated

in the porous wick of the capillary evaporator.

Fixed conductance CPLs have the following operating characteristics: (i) the sub-

cooler is usually an integral part of the condenser; (ii) they do not have a reservoir that

works as a fluid accumulator; (iii) the vapor condensation area in the condenser remains

constant as the thermal load varies; (iv) the system operation temperature is dependent

on the thermal load, supplied to the evaporator, and on the condenser sink temperature.

At the evaporation front (liquid-vapor interface), the pressure difference between the

phases is the capillary pressure, which can be expressed by the Young-Laplace’s equation,

?pcap = pv ?pl =
2? cos ?

r
. (1.1)

For an averaged radius of curvature r of the liquid-vapor interfaces, the capillary

pressure becomes maximum when the contact angle between the liquid and the solid

approaches zero, in other words, when the wettability of the working fluid is maximum.

At the evaporation interface, the average radius of curvature of the liquid-vapor in-

terface adjusts itself in order to balance the capillary pressure, as predicted by Young-

Laplace’s equation above. The minimum possible radius of curvature before dry-out of

the pore is the characteristic radius of the pore. This radius depends on the pore topol-

ogy and is determined by the choice of base material and manufacturing process, e.g.,

sintering, used to produce the porous wicks. The maximum capillary pressure that the

wick can withstand for a zero contact angle is therefore,



1 Introduction 4

?pcap,max =
2?

rp
(1.2)

This characteristic average pore radius rp for the pore structure is related to the

threshold for percolation of the non-wetting phase and is commonly identified, by Young-

Laplace, as the wick bubbling pressure. In the operation of a capillary evaporator, when

the pressure losses of the system exceed the maximum capillary pressure, the system fails.

The capillary limit of a CPL reflects this maximum pumping capacity.

Therefore, the normal CPL operation requires that the sum of the pressure losses

in the components and in the transport lines be smaller than the maximum capillary

pressure head developed by the wick, i.e.,

?pcap,max ? ?pevap + ?pcond + ?pv + ?pl + ?pg (1.3)

In Eq. 1.3 the pressure losses are identified as: ?pevap - pressure loss in the evaporator,

?pcond - pressure loss in the condenser, ?pv - pressure loss in the vapor lines, ?pl - pressure

loss in the liquid lines and ?pg - pressure difference due to gravity.

The pressure loss along the lines of liquid (?pl) and vapor (?pv) can be approximated

by using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

?p(l) or (v) = f

(
L

dh

)(
?v2

2

)
, (1.4)

where f is the Darcy (or Moody) friction factor, L is the pipe length, dh is the hydraulic

diameter and v is the average flow velocity.

The most important component of the total pressure loss, accounting for approxi-

mately from 40 to 95% of the total pressure loss, is the pressure drop along the porous

structure of the capillary evaporator. This pressure loss can be approximated by Darcy’s

equation,

?pwick =
lµl

?lAlKl

.
ml (1.5)

where
Al
l

is the average area for flow divided by the lenght of the flow path, µl is the

liquid dynamic viscosity, Kl is the liquid permeability and
.
ml is the liquid mass flow rate

accross the porous wick.

This estimate will be further improved when the results are analyzed. For now, it



1 Introduction 5

makes it clear that the permeability of the porous medium, which ranges from 10?10 to

10?15 m2 for different porous structures, affects greatly the pressure drop.

The Carman-Kozeny equation provides a simple model that relates permeability to

the average pore diameter such that,

Kl =
?3

180 (1 ? ?)2
d2, (1.6)

where ? is the porosity and d is the average pore diameter of the porous wick. The validity

of this equation will not be discussed now. It suffices to say that the permeability scales

with the square of the average pore diameter.

The maximum capillary pressure head is a function of the fluid surface tension, the

contact angle and the pore radius. On the other hand, the pressure losses on the right side

of Eq. 1.3, depend on the system design and the power input to the evaporator. When

the total pressure loss in the system exceeds the maximum capillary pressure head, vapor

penetrates in the wick causing dry-out and possibly blockage of the liquid inlet. When

this occurs, the system fails.

The thermodynamic states of the working fluid may be suitably presented in a p-T

diagram such as the one shown in Fig. 1.2. The numbering corresponds to the states

identified in Fig. 1.1. In point 1, the liquid vaporizes at a saturation temperature T1

corresponding to a pressure p1. The vapor flows along the evaporator grooves and there

is a pressure drop due to viscous friction from p1 to p2. Point 2 is located closer to the

evaporator outlet, where liquid vaporizes at a lower saturation temperature T
?
2. Therefore,

the liquid vaporizes along the external wick surface at a temperature range between T1 and

T
?
2, instead of a fixed temperature T1. The vapor leaves the evaporator in the superheated

state (point 2) partly due to the decrease in the saturation pressure and partly due to

the proximity of the hot source that supplies heat to the system. The vapor pressure

decreases as it flows along the vapor transport line, between points 2 and 3. Since the

vapor experiences an adiabatic expansion, its temperature decreases slightly.

The thermodynamic state of the vapor that enters in the condenser is represented by

the temperature T3 and pressure p3. As shown by Ku (1994), a small area of the condenser

is enough to dissipate the sensible heat before the beginning of the vapor condensation in

the point 4 at a pressure p4 (smaller than p3) and at a saturation temperature T4. The

vapor condensation occurs between points 4 and 5. At point 5 there is no longer vapor.

Similar to the liquid vaporization in the evaporator, the vapor condensation occurs at a

temperature range between T4 and T5. The liquid continues to lose sensible heat until

it reaches a subcooled temperature T6 in the condenser outlet. A further subcooling

1.1).

is needed to T
?
6 to ensure that no vapor bubble reaches in the evaporator. The liquid

temperature increases slightly to T7, while the pressure decreases to p7 in the liquid

feeding channel of the evaporator. Inside the feeding channel, the liquid is heated until

temperature T8. This heating is due to the upstream heat leak from the wick to the fluid.

The point 8
?

represents the saturation state corresponding to the local pressure p8.

From point 8 to point 9 the liquid pressure falls. As the liquid flows through the wick,

its temperature is increased until reaching the saturation temperature T1 corresponding

to the pressure p1 before its evaporation in the external surface of the wick. It is noticed

by Fig. 1.2 that the liquid side of the menisci (point 9) is represented as superheated.

The total pressure drop in the system is equal to the difference between p1 and p9

which in its turn must be smaller than the maximum capillary pressure head for normal

operation. Following Ku (1999), in most of the two-phase capillary pumping systems,

the changes of pressure and temperature are extremely small. These changes along a

saturation line may be approximated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

dp

????
Tsat

=
hlv

Tsatvlv
(1.7)

where hlv is the latent heat of vaporization, Tsat is the saturation temperature and vlv is

the difference in specific volumes of the liquid and vapor phases.

For instance, the variation of the pressure and temperature between points 1 and 4

are related by



1 Introduction 7

dp

dT

????
T4

(T1 ?T4) ' (p1 ?p4) . (1.8)

This pressure drop is a function of the mass flow rate which in its turn is a function

of the power input to the evaporator.

The heat transfer rate at vaporization is equal to that at condensation (
.

Qcond =

Qevap).

The heat transfer rate in the condenser can be expressed as:

.

Qcond = hcondAcond (T4 ?T0) , (1.9)

where hcond is the heat transfer coefficient, Acond is the heat transfer area in the condenser

and T0 is the temperature of the cold reservoir outside the condenser.

For a CPL with fixed liquid volume, the thermal conductance (hcondAcond) remains

constant. For a given heat transfer rate rejected by the condenser (
.

Qcond) and a condenser

sink temperature T0, the vapor in the condenser will condense at the temperature T4 in

agreement with Eq. 1.9 and the liquid will vaporize in the evaporator at the temperature

T1 in agreement with Eq. 1.8. Any change in the input heat to the evaporator and/or

in the condenser sink temperature will result in changes of the T1 and T4. Therefore, the

main characteristic of a fixed conductance CPL is its strong dependence of the operation

temperature on the input heat and condenser sink temperature.

1.1.2 CPL with Variable Conductance

In a variable conductance CPL, an online fluid reservoir is added. The function of

the reservoir is to control the operation temperature of the system and to accumulate the

liquid excess that is not being required in the loop.

The variable conductance mechanism may be explained using Eq. 1.9. If the condenser

sink temperature T0 remains constant and the system thermal load increases, more vapor

will be generated in the evaporator and the vapor excess will accumulate in the condenser,

causing a local pressure increase. This pressure increase, in its turn, causes a liquid

displacement from the condenser to the reservoir, as represented in Fig. 1.3. This occurs

because the condensation temperature T4 remains constant and the heat transfer area

Acond increases so that Eq. 1.9 is satisfied.

When the system thermal load decreases and T0 remains constant, the vapor pressure

into the condenser will decrease. An unbalance in the pressure difference between the

reservoir and the condenser will force a liquid displacement from the reservoir to the



1 Introduction 8

condenser, reducing the heat transfer area Acond so that Eq. 1.9 is again satisfied. A

similar analysis can be made varying the condenser sink temperature T0.

Figure 1.4 depicts a PT diagram for the variable conductance CPL shown in Fig. 1.3.

Point 11 corresponds to the saturation state in the reservoir. The vapor condensation tem-

perature T4 is related to the reservoir saturation temperature T11 by Clausius-Clapeyron

and this temperature difference can be approximated by,

(T4 ?T11) =
(p4 ?p11) T11vlv

hlv
. (1.10)

Figure 1.4 – PT diagram for a variable conductance CPL (corresponding to Fig. 1.3).

The variable conductance CPL, represented in Fig. 1.3, operates as follows. Before

the system startup, the condenser is submitted to the temperature T0 and the reservoir

is heated up to temperature T11 which is higher than the temperatures of the rest of the



1 Introduction 9

loop. Then, the thermal load is supplied to the evaporator. As the evaporator is heated

up to the same temperature T11 or slightly above that, the liquid is vaporized and flows to

the condenser along the vapor transport line. An equilibrium condition is established in

the condenser so that the vapor condenses at the temperature T4 that is very close to the

reservoir temperature T11. An equilibrium condition is also established in the evaporator

so that the liquid vaporizes at the temperature T1.

The condensation temperature T4 is not sensitive neither to the changes in the con-

denser sink temperature T0, nor to the changes in the system thermal load. Therefore,

the temperature T4 is controlled by the reservoir saturation temperature T11. This tem-

perature control is only possible if the reservoir is under two phase condition.

1.1.3 LHP

LHP is a kind of variable conductance CPL and was developed to overcome the

apparent disadvantage of CPL that requires pre-heating during the startup. In LHP,

the reservoir, also denominated hydro-accumulator or compensation chamber, ensures

the presence of liquid in the evaporator wick. A secondary wick usually connects the

compensation chamber to the evaporator. The compensation chamber is located close to

the evaporator, usually in the inlet of the capillary evaporator, as it can be seen in Fig. 1.5;

or taking the place of what would be the liquid feeding channel of the evaporator. Thereby,

in a LHP the liquid reservoir presents direct thermal contact with the evaporator (hot

source), differently of CPL where it is connected to the condenser (cold source). Figure

1.6 depicts a PT diagram for the variable conductance LHP, shown in Fig. 1.5. Point 10

corresponds to the saturation state in the compensation chamber.

Figure 1.5 – Functional schematic of a LHP.



1 Introduction 10

Figure 1.6 – PT diagram for a LHP (corresponding to Fig. 1.5).

The liquid vaporization temperature T1 is related to the saturation temperature of

the compensation chamber T10 by Clausius-Clapeyron approximated as,

(T1 ?T10) =
(p1 ?p10) T10vlv

hlv
. (1.11)

The PT diagram, shown in Fig. 1.6, presents an analysis for steady state operation.

Therefore, there is no mass flow from the compensation chamber to the liquid feeding

channel of the evaporator. Consequently, the saturation pressure p10 in the compensation

chamber is the same as pressure p7.

1.1.4 CPL and LHP

The capillary pumping systems in the variable conductance mode, i.e., the CPL and

LHP shown in Figs. 1.3 and 1.5, can also work in a binary operation mode. When

these systems are operating in a low thermal load condition, the reservoir (CPL) or the

compensation chamber (LHP) present stable liquid and vapor regions. As it was al-

ready mentioned, when the thermal load increases, the condensation front moves forward,

causing a liquid displacement from the condenser to the reservoir (CPL) or to the com-

pensation chamber (LHP). Therefore, as the thermal load increases, these compartments

are increasingly filled in with liquid. The evaporation temperature control is only possible

if the liquid compartment of the system presents both liquid and vapor. Consequently, if

the thermal load increases up to a condition where all the volume of the reservoir (CPL) or

the compensation chamber (LHP) is filled with liquid, the saturation temperature control



1 Introduction 11

ceases to be possible.

Figure 1.7 shows qualitatively the variation of the evaporation temperature distribu-

tion as a function of the thermal load of CPL and LHP that work in the binary operation

mode (fixed and variable conductance). Fig. 1.7(a) depicts that the evaporator tempera-

ture of the CPL remains constant in the variable conductance operation mode and starts

to increase linearly in the fixed conductance mode. For the LHP, Fig. 1.7(b), even oper-

ating in the variable conductance operation mode, the evaporator temperature does not

remain constant. The LHP possesses a range of evaporation temperature control in the

variable conductance mode. This occurs, according to Chernysheva et al. (2007), due to

two factors: (i) decrease of the condensation area, caused by the liquid displacement from

the condenser to the compensation chamber; and (ii) change in the saturation temperature

in the compensation chamber T11, that influences directly the change of the evaporation

temperature, due to a complex process of heat and mass transfer. This process develops

between the evaporator and the compensation chamber.

Figure 1.7 – Typical curves of operation for (a) CPL and (b) LHP in the fixed and variable
conductance (NIKITKIN; CULLIMORE, 1998).

The thermo and fluid dynamic analysis of capillary pumping systems, presented in

these sections, has helped to explain the phenomena that occur in these systems. The

next section summarizes the main results of recent research involving the application of

capillary pumping systems (CPLs and LHPs) for thermal control in general.

1.2 Overview of CPL and LHP Experiments

Thermal control has become a relevant issue in modern computers due to their con-

tinuous size decreasing and power increasing requirements. According to Nikitkin &amp;amp;

Cullimore (1998) and Maydanik (2005), the LHPs and CPLs, which were previously de-

veloped for spacecraft thermal control, are reliable alternatives and can also transport

heat with high performance for terrestrial electronic cooling application. Several authors



1 Introduction 12

(CHEN; LIN, 2001; HOANG et al., 2003; PASTUKHOV et al., 2003; MAYDANIK, 2005; CHEN et

al., 2006; PASTUKHOV; MAYDANIK, 2007) have reported experimental results concerning

the application of LHPs, mini-LHPs and CPLs for heat dissipation in CPUs of modern

computers, showing that they are efficient and reliable heat transfer devices for the next

generation of microprocessors.

It has been customary to express the quality of LHPs and CPLs by the thermal

resistance R(oC/W) given by,

R =
?T

Q
, (1.12)

where Q is the heat transfer rate dissipated by the two-phase system and ?T is the

temperature difference between the hot surface, where the thermal load is applied, and

the cold reservoir.

The thermal resistence is size dependent, but it is the figure of merit usually reported

in the literature. A different figure of merit will be proposed when the results of this work

are analyzed.

The thermal performance and reliability of the LHPs and CPLs have been extensively

tested. Ku (1999), Chen &amp;amp; Lin (2001), Pastukhov et al. (2003), Chuang (2003), Ku et al.

(2004), Pastukhov &amp;amp; Maydanik (2007), Maydanik &amp;amp; Vershinin (2009) analyzed the ther-

mal behavior and startup of the capillary pumping systems (LHP and CPL) regarding

the working fluid inventory, slopes of the capillary systems, wick material (nickel, stain-

less steel, copper, polyethylene), body material of the evaporator (copper and stainless

steel), cooling system of the condenser (forced convection using water and air, and nat-

ural convection using air), multi-evaporators and condensers, heat sink and environment

temperatures at ground and microgravity conditions for a range of power inputs. The

most recent and promissing systems are reviewed below.

Hoang et al. (2003) have developed and tested three miniature LHPs with ammonia,

propylene and water as working fluids for electronics cooling. All LHPs were assisted by a

secondary cooling system in the compensation chamber in order to decrease the heat leak.

Two cooling systems were tested: a small thermo-electric cooler (TEC) and a heat pipe

made of copper with 3 mm of diameter, which uses water as working fluid. Two of the

LHPs were capable of transporting heat up to 60 W (ammonia) and 15 W (propylene)

at room temperature of 25 oC in any orientation. The other LHP using water, which

was the main objective of the paper, was tested with and without the heat pipe at the

compensation chamber. An air cooling fan was used for the cooling of the condenser.

This LHP was made of copper and the wick was made of Teflon with pore size of 7 µm



1 Introduction 13

and permeability of 1 × 10?13 m2. The water LHP was capable of transporting heat
up to 220 W for a capillary pump temperature up to 82 oC assisted by the heat pipe

in the compensation chamber and up to 90 oC without the heat pipe assistence. The

total thermal resistance ranged from 2.0 to 0.2 oC/W. The use of the heat pipe for the

controlling of the heat leak had a significant influence on the heat transfer capacity of the

LHP.

Six miniature LHPs were developed and tested by Pastukhov et al. (2003) for cooling

electronics components and CPUs of mobile PCs. Ammonia and acetone were used as

working fluid. Porous wicks made of stainless steel and titanium were used as porous

structures. Air was used for the condenser cooling and the diameter of the cylindrical

evaporators ranged from 5 to 6 mm. The LHPs were capable of heat transfer up to 40 W

for cooling the CPU of a notebook with total resistance raging from 1.0 to 2.4 oC/W. The

CPU temperature was kept between 83 and 90 oC. They concluded that further decrease

in total thermal resistance could be obtained by optimization of the LHP design and

the condenser cooling, and the ammonia as a working fluid ensured better results when

compared to acetone.

Chen et al. (2006) performed a series of tests with a miniature loop heat pipe (mLHP)

which was developed for cooling CPUs of mobile personal computers. Amonnia was

used as working fluid and the material of the wick was titanium with break down pore

radius of 17.2 µm, porosity of 78% and permeability of 11.5 × 10?12 m2. They tested
the mLHP at several positions (horizontal, condenser above evaporator, evaporator above

condenser, compensation chamber above evaporator and evaporator above compensation

chamber), with emphasis to the position with evaporator 10o above condenser and vice

versa. The thermal behavior of mLHP was evaluated during the start-up and for different

sink temperatures. At sink temperature of 25 oC and in horizontal position, the mLHP

was capable of transporting heat up to 70 W for a limit temperature of 80 oC and the

total thermal resistance ranged from 0.2 to 0.85 oC/W. They concluded that for the

tested mLHPs, which are targeted at consumer electronics cooling, the overall operating

characteristics for horizontal orientation proved to be satisfying.

Maydanik &amp;amp; Vershinin (2009) developed and tested nine mLHPs with cylindrical

capillary evaporators. Three mLHPs with external diameter of 5 mm and six mLHPs

with external diameter of 6 mm. They used ammonia as working fluid for all mLHPs and

different materials for the wick (titanium, with average pore radius of 9.5 and 17.2 µm

and porosity of 70 and 78%, and nickel with average pore radius ranging of 13.5 and 10.0

µm and porosity of 71, 66 and 65%). The envelope of the cylindrical evaporator was made

of titanium and nickel. Several tests were carried out in order to evaluate the thermal



1 Introduction 14

behavior of mLHPs taking into account the inclination of the devices, the temperature

of cooling in the condenser section and the type of the cooling fluid (air and water in

forced convection). They presented a methodology for estimating the thermal resistances

and the heat transfer coefficients of the mLHPs. The minima total thermal resistances

were 0.53 oC/W and 0.14 oC/W for air and water cooling, respectively. The maximum

capacity was 230 W for water cooling.

As shown, most of porous wicks are made of metals or polymers. However, these

materials present some difficulties for machining (metal wicks) and low capillary pumping

capacity (polymer wick). The machining of metal wicks may obstruct the surface pores,

decreasing the permeability. The next section presents some works that were aimed

at manufacturing, characterization and application of porous wick in capillary pumping

systems.

1.3 Application of Ceramic Wicks in Capillary Pump-

ing Systems

Although the LHPs and CPLs present high heat transfer capacity, one disadvantage

is their complicated manufacture. The proper fitting of the capillary structure inside the

envelope of the evaporator is the first challenge to be overcome. The assembly is relatively

complex because the metallic envelope requires close contact tolerances at the interface

between envelope walls and wick surface. This contact should be fit in order to minimize

the thermal resistance and any vapor leak back to the compensation chamber (LHP) and

to the liquid feeding channel (CPL). With the aim of obtaining close tolerances, a reliable

machining process is required for these wick structures because the possibility of open

porosity obstruction due to the plastic deformation. The ceramic wicks do not present

plastic deformation during machining. Therefore, they can be machined by conventional

machining and the open porosity remains the same (JANSSEN et al., 2008).

To this author knowledge, there are few capillary pumping systems using ceramic

porous wick as a porous structure of capillary evaporator (RASSAMAKIN et al., 2002; RHI,

2006). Most LHPs and CPLs use polyethylene or metallic porous wicks. It is expected

that ceramic wicks become more advantageous, because they are less expensive and easier

to machine without damaging the pores in the external surface of the structure. Also the

low thermal conductivity can minimize the radial heat leak to the liquid feeding channel,

reducing the possibility of boiling in the liquid inlet.

Reimbrecht (2004) developed a methodology for manufacturing of porous wicks for

the application in capillary pumping systems. Several techniques - image analysis, mer-



1 Introduction 15

cury intrusion porosimetry and other experimental methods - were employed to determine

static and transport properties of the porous wick such as critical pore diameter, perme-

ability and thermal conductivity. He manufactured metallic (nickel and stainless steel)

and ceramic porous wicks and tested them in capillary pumping loops (CPLs). The CPL

with the ceramic porous wick was capable of heat transfer up to 40 W (1.4 W/cm2) using

acetone. However this CPL did not work adequately in a second test for a heat load of 20

W (0.7 W/cm2). The failure was due to the contamination of the working fluid caused by

the residual carbon from the organic material that was used to increase porosity in the

manufacturing of the ceramic wick.

The wicks obtained by Reimbrecht (2004) had critical pore diameter of 0.9 µm (nickel)

and 2.5 µm (stainless steel). The ceramic porous wicks and their pore size distribution

obtained by mercury porosimetry are depicted in Fig. 1.8. It can be noted in Fig. 1.8 (b)

that the ceramic porous wick has a narrow pore size distribution with 95% of the pore

volume being formed by pores with sizes ranging from 0.5 µm to 3.5 µm with average at

1.2 µm.

The objective of the work by Reimbrecht (2004) was to study and optimize the porous

samples manufacturing routes, as well as, to evaluate the characterization of these porous

structures for the application in capillary pumping systems. With this goal, nickel, stain-

less steel, mullite and alumina were employed as raw materials. Camargo (2004) aimed at

test and analyze all porous wicks manufactured by Reimbrecht (2004), and also another

wick made of polyethylene. Two test rigs were built to evaluate the developed CPLs. He

tested the CPLs using acetone and ammonia as working fluid, reaching pumping capacity

up to 25 kPa. The main results presented by Camargo (2004) for the CPL using ammonia

are summarized in Table 1.1.

The results presented by Camargo (2004), showed that the CPL with a ceramic wick

had a successful started-up only for heat load of 10 W, but even though it did not reach

the stabilization. Moreover, the ceramic wick resulted in the worst performance when

compared to the other wicks (nickel, stainless steel and polyethylene).

According to the results in Table 1.1, the ceramic wick supplies the greater pumping

capacity, however according to Camargo (2004), its low permeability has compromised

the performance of the CPL. Camargo (2004) concluded that the permeability of ceramic

wicks should be increased for it to become a reliable component in capillary pumping

systems. Nevertheless, according to author knowledge of this thesis, the non successfull

operation of the CPL was due to the manufacture of the capillary evaporator, mainly in

the insertion of the porous wick into the metallic envelop.

Berti (2008) focused his work on the development of manufacturing routes of ceramic

wicks in order to improve the ceramic wick manufactured by Reimbrecht (2004) and tested

by Camargo (2004) before. The purpose of his work was to manufacture and characterize

ceramic wicks for capillary pumping applications. In this way, two manufacturing routes

were developed: slip casting and biotemplating. The ceramic wick manufactured by slip

casting resulted in porosity of 50%, pore size ranging from 1 to 3 µm providing capillary

pressure ranging from 80 to 22 kPa (using acetone) and permeability of 1.5 × 10?14 m2.
The ceramic wick manufactured by biotemplating resulted in porosity of 76% pore size

ranging from 33 to 194 µm providing capillary pressure ranging from 0.48 to 3 kPa (using

acetone) permeability of 1.5 × 10?10 m2.

Berti (2008) manufactured and tested two CPLs that used acetone as working fluid.

The CPL using ceramic wick manufactured by slip casting worked for heat load of 40

W (3.93 W/cm2) and the other CPL using ceramic wick manufactured by biotemplating

worked for heat load of 20 W (11.32 W/cm2). The CPLs worked satisfactorily, however

Berti (2008) reported that he had many problems regarding the assembly of the capilary

evaporator and also heat leak through the wall of evaporator to the liquid feeding channel

due to the geometry used for the flat capillary evaporators.



1 Introduction 17

Since the heat and mass transfer required for the working fluid circulation along the

loop is the most important phenomenon in capillary evaporators, this is reviewed next.

The following section will present some geometries of capillary evaporators, the general

description of physical phenomena that take place within the porous wick and the math-

ematical models proposed to solve the heat and mass transfer in capillary evaporators.

1.4 Description of the Problem Under Investigation

The main component of capillary pumping systems (LHP and CPL) is the capil-

lary evaporator. Micro-grooves or porous wicks are used in the evaporators as capillary

structures. Most CPLs and LHPs manufactured nowadays use porous wicks. There

are basically two designs for cylindrical capillary evaporators, as shown in Fig. 1.9. A

cylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in the metallic envelope is depicted in Fig.

1.9(a), while in Fig. 1.9(b) it is shown a cylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in

the porous wick. Figure 1.10 depicts two flat evaporators, one with disk format and the

other with square cross-section. In both evaporators shown in Fig. 1.10, the grooves are

machined in the metalic envelope.

(a) (b)

Figure 1.9 – (a) Cylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in the metallic envelope.
(b) cylindrical evaporator with grooves machined in the porous wick.

During operation, heat is applied to the external surface of the evaporator and the

working fluid within the wick undergoes evaporation. The vapor flows out of the evap-

orator along the grooves. The evaporation rate of the working fluid within capillary

evaporators depends on the heat load applied to the system and can occur in three dif-

ferent regimes: (1) microfilm evaporation, (2) evaporation at the outer surface and (3)

within the porous wick.

The uncertainty regarding the location of the evaporation front and the stablishment

of capillary limits for the wick operation has motivated attempts to solve the mass and heat

transfer problem within the porous wick. Some of the theoretical modeling is reviewed

below.

Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a) studied the evaporation in porous wicks under restrictive as-

sumptions, that nevertheless, provided analytical solutions for the velocity and temper-

ature fields. They assumed that the wick was completely saturated by liquid and the

evaporation front was located in the external surface. Their model also assumes that

the velocity field is uniform on the boundaries of the wick which is not exactly true as

it will be shown bellow. They made a parametric analysis mostly directed to show that

their analytical solution is accurate for most applications. Then, they concluded that the

results obtained are of relevance for the design of capillary evaporators.

Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994b) reported an extension of their previous paper presenting an

analysis of a three-dimensional geometry. A numerical investigation was developed for

studying the flow of the liquid through the wick (two-dimensional) and the flow of the va-

por through the grooves (three-dimensional). A comparison between the results obtained

in both models for three working fluids (freon, water and ammonia) is presented and as

a consequence they concluded that the working fluid has a strong effect on the difference

between the two- and three-dimensional models. For water, the difference was relatively

large. For freon and ammonia, however, the differences are generally small, i.e., in this

case, the solutions obtained with the two-dimensional model are accurate and reliable.

They attribute these differences to the small vapor velocities for freon and ammonia (be-

low 2.5 m/s) in comparison to water vapor velocity (12.5 m/s) for a heat flux of 1.5×104

W/m2. In both works published by Cao and Faghri, they state that the results obtained

are of relevance for the design of capillary evaporators, however they do not present a

criterion for the dry-out of the porous wick, i.e., there is no information regarding the

critical heat flux before the failure of the capillary evaporator or at least a tendency for



1 Introduction 19

that.

Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994) made a theoretical investigation of the heat and mass

transfer problem in the porous wick of a capillary pumping system. In their analysis, the

wick was heated by a heat flux from the fins in contact with the wick. In their model,

the fluid within the wick changes phase, developing a vapor-saturated region separated

from a liquid-saturated region by a sharp evaporation front. At the evaporation front, the

continuity of mass and heat and a jump in pressure due to capillary pressure is applied.

A numerical solution of the mathematical model allowed to study the displacement of the

evaporation front as the thermal load of the system varies.

They assumed that two limiting conditions are physically possible. For low heat load,

there is a small vapor saturated region trapped underneath the fin, Fig. 1.11(a). The

continuity of the liquid phase with the groove would then allow for the presence of a

curved meniscus at the fin-wick contact line. All evaporation occurs in the wick-groove

interface. As the heat load increases, the fluid in the meniscus evaporates and there is

continuity of the vapor phase from the vapor-saturated region to the groove. Evaporation

occurs both in the vapor-saturated region and in the groove interface, Fig. 1.11(b).

Figure 1.11 – Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994) model (a) low heat load and (b) higher heat
load.

At the liquid saturated surface in contact with the groove, the same conditions used

for the evaporation front applies. The heat transfer to the vapor in the grooves is modeled

using a surface convection heat transfer coefficient. All mass flux reaching the surface is

suposed to evaporate absorbing the difference between the conductive heat flux from the

wick and the convective heat flux to the vapor in the groove. The vapor phase in the

groove is assumed to exist under saturated condition [Tsat(pv)].

The evaporation on the meniscus is modeled assuming a global heat transfer coefficient

that includes a conductive thermal resistence accross the liquid film. The conduction heat

transfer in the fin is also solved. Their results show that the evaporation is far more intense

at the wick-groove interface than it is at the evaporation front. This occurs because the



1 Introduction 20

flow of vapor out of the region underneath the fin is hindered by the low value of the

vapor kinematic viscosity, as compared to the liquid kinematic viscosity, and the small

sections available for flow near the fin-wick-groove triple line.

Maximum heat loads are absorbed at the threshold between the two regimes, exactly

when the boundary of the trapped vapor phase reaches the fin-wick-groove triple line.

Once the meniscus is dried-out, the heat load that can be absorbed reduces abruptly.

The authors do not present results of the value of the critical heat flux at the threshold

for the transition between the two limits. Only a qualitative analysis is presented.

Demidov and Yatsenko’s work presents a modeling effort that is plenty of physical

insights, however they did not quantify the limits of heat load for their porous wick. The

effective properties, boundary conditions and dimensions are summarized in the table in

Fig. 1.15, but no value of heat load applied has been reported.

Figus et al. (1999) analyzed a similar problem and attempted to quantify the change in

evaporation regime as the heat load applied increased. In their work, the evaporation front

is supposed to be immersed within the porous wick. They applied two different treatments:

a continuum model, similar to the one used by Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994), and a pore

network model, similar to the drying models developed earlier by Prat (1993, 1995) and

Laurindo &amp;amp; Prat (1996). The main difference in the formulation of the continuum model

when compared to Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994) is that Figus et al. (1999) did not include

the evaporation at the wick-groove interface. All evaporation occurred within the wick.

They modeled the heat and mass transfer problem of a cross section of a cylindrical

evaporator as shown in Fig. 1.12.

Additional differences in boundary conditions are that Tl is prescribed in the liquid

side of the wick, the heat flux is prescribed at the wick-fin interface and the saturation

temperature is prescribed at the wick-groove interface. The results show that the fin

surface is far from isotherm, presenting a gradient of the order of 60oC/mm. Then,

emphasis was placed on determining the conditions that lead to instability and fingering

in the evaporation front. The continuum models do not capture these transitions since

they are not appropriate to model phenomena near the threshold for percolation (PRAT,

1995), where small local fluctuations govern the development of the evaporation front.

Figus et al. (1999) present solutions for a low effective thermal conductivity medium

(?s = 4 W/m-K) and for a high thermal conductivity medium (?s = 10 W/m-K) as

summarized in the table in Fig. 1.15. For the low thermal conductivity medium, their

results show that when the pore size is constant and equal to 10µm, the vapor phase

invades the wick, i.e., forms a vapor-saturated region underneath the fin, only for q?? &gt;

4, 500 W/m2. The solutions where explored for q?? as high as 90, 000 W/m2 and all the

evaporation front developed with a smooth surface such that they are well predicted by

the continuum models.

Then, a pore size distribution was assigned randonly to the pore space with average

10µm and ratio of maximum to minimum pore size denoted by R = dmax/dmin. For

the higher thermal conductivity medium and R = 2, the vapor phase invades the wick

at q?? = 1, 000 W/m2. Above this value, the front develops with irregular surface. For

q?? from 15, 000 to 35, 000 W/m2, the front is pinned. After 35, 000 W/m2, the front

area increases steadily until the breakthrough of the vapor accross the wick occurs at

q?? = 200, 000 W/m2.

The invasion of the pore network occurs when the local vapor pressure overcome the

capillary limit for the pore. The final breakthrough occurs when even the smaller pore

are overcome by the local vapor pressure. As the ratio R = dmax/dmin is increased, the

final breakthrough occurs for even smaller values of q??. For their model, the position

of the evaporation front and, therefore, the breakthrough, does not depend on the wick

thermal conductivity. This is a result from their choice of imposing temperature boundary

conditions.

Aparently, they also used a constant value for the surface tension, independent of

the local temperture. As the heat flux was increased, the fin temperature also increased,

reaching values as high as 100 oC. They conclude discussing that this problem is similar

to an invasion-percolation problem characterized by small cappilary number (Ca = vµ/?)



1 Introduction 22

for which, the vapor-liquid front develops as a stable fractal surface. As recomendation

for the design of porous wicks, they recomended (i) to use of materials with high thermal

conductivity (?) to limit the fin temperature and high permeability medium as a layer

near the fin, followed by (ii) a second layer with low ? material and small pore size near

the liquid side.

Although Figus et al. (1999) did not correlate the threshold for the wick failure,

they showed clearly the trend of the vapor invasion-percolation process. The local vapor

pressure depends on the solution of Darcy’s equation for the porous wick. The local

critical (i.e., maximum) capillary pressure that a given pore can withstand is a function

of the pore size and the surface tension, which is calculated locally from the medium

temperature. Therefore, the breakthrough criterion can be tested locally and whenever

the critical capillary pressure is exceeded, local dry-out occurs.

Takahashi (2002) analyzed the heat and mass transfer with phase change in the cylin-

drical porous wick of a capillary evaporator (Fig. 1.13) in order to determine the maximum

heat flux for steady-state operation of a CPL before its failure based on the capillary limit.

Takahashi assumed as Figus et al. (1999), that the evaporation front develops within the

wick. The differences between his work and the previous analysis (FIGUS et al., 1999) are

the inclusion of the capillary pressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface, the modification

in a boundary condition and a simplification in the geometry. Takahashi (2002) solved

numerically the problem using the finite volume method in orthogonal curvilinear coor-

dinates fitted to the evaporation interface. He used a tracking method of the evaporation

front combined with an adaptive mesh to this liquid-vapor interface.

Figure 1.13 – (a) Cross-section of the capillary evaporator and (b) sector used in the
analysis, Takahashi (2002)

Takahashi (2002) analized the ammonia as working fluid and obtained the properties

for the nickel wick manufactured by Reimbrecht et al. (1999). The maximum capillary

pressure was obtained from mercury porosimetry and from a drainage experiment. He



1 Introduction 23

presented results regarding the location of the evaporation front for different heat fluxes.

Besides, he calculated a maximum heat flux for steady-state operation of 13.06 × 104

W/m2. At this critical heat flux, the flow of liquid was 2.66 × 10?5 kg/s, the maximum
temperature difference (between fin and liquid channel) was 101 oC and the heat flux to

the liquid channel was 0.798 × 104 W/m2. His results compared well to those of Figus
et al. (1999). The values of the critical heat flux was calculated for different properties

(maximum heat flux of 130613 W/ m2 for steady-state operation), but no attempt was

made of parametrization of the results obtained.

Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006) studied numerically the heat and mass transfer in the capillary

porous structure of a loop heat pipe (LHP), presented in Fig. 1.14, with a focus on the

occurrence of the boiling limit. The problem was basically the same as Demidov &amp;amp;

Yatsenko (1994) and Figus et al. (1999) with a similar formulation. One difference in the

formulation was that the model takes into account the convective terms in the energy

equation. However, as shown by Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a) their contribution is expected to

be small. They also included the heat conduction in the fin and the envelope in their

solution. The heat load is prescribed as an uniform heat flux at the external surface of

the metalic envelope.

Fig. 5 represents the temperature field and liquid velo-
city vectors when the wick is completely saturated by liquid
at Qin = 100 W. The solution is obtained by solving the
mass conservation, Darcy and energy equations. At this
heat load, by using the one-dimensional mathematical
model, it is calculated that Tsat = 7.81 ?C and Dp = 247 Pa.
As the vapor flows along the grooves, it becomes super-
heated due to the heating from the wall. Without solving
the vapor flow in the grooves using a three-dimensional
model, it is not possible to calculate the vapor temperature
in the grooves. Accurate experimental measurements are
also difficult although a range for the vapor superheat
can be deduced based on the wall-temperature measure-
ments. In our calculations, the vapor in the grooves is
assumed to be superheated by 3 ?C. A similar approach
is also used in Figus et al. [4]. Thus, Tv = 10.81 ?C and
other related parameters for the calculations are as follows:
Pv = 569784.8 Pa, Pcore = 569537.8 Pa, qin = 1254 W m

?2,
kc = kw = 14.5 W m

?1 K?1, keff = 6.073 W m
?1 K?1, and

hi = 2.733 · 10
6 W m?2 K?1. The thermal properties of

ammonia are calculated at the saturation temperature for
a given applied power using the relations in [16]. In the
numerical calculations, the thermal properties are assumed
constant for a given saturation temperature.

It can be seen from Fig. 5 that, the working fluid evap-
orates at the wick interface under the applied heat load.
The liquid flows from the evaporator core into the wick
and turns toward the interface under the fin. The heat flux
along the fin–wick interface is not constant and varies
around 2000 W m?2. In comparison, in the previously ref-
erenced works [3–5] with an exception in [6], an estimated
constant heat flux is directly applied at the fin–wick surface
and the temperature drop across the casing is ignored due
to the low thermal resistance. Applying the heat at the cas-
ing allows the calculation of the temperature distribution at
the casing surface. At low heat loads, the liquid velocity is
relatively small as well as the corresponding Peclet number
(Pe = qinLwcpl/hfgkeff). For example, at Qin = 100 W, Pe is
on the order of 10?2. Therefore, the contribution from
the convective terms could be neglected. Therefore, in the
earlier solutions [3–5], the Laplace equation for the temper-
ature is solved instead of the full energy equation. With this
assumption, the Darcy and energy equations are also
decoupled, which significantly simplifies the solution algo-
rithm. However, at higher heat loads, the convective terms
need to be taken account as is done in [6]. In our study, we
keep the convective terms in the governing equations and
solve together the mass conservation, Darcy and energy
equations as a coupled problem.

The determination of the effective thermal conductivity
of the wick keff is not trivial as it depends in a complex man-
ner on the geometry of the porous medium. The solution on
Fig. 5 is obtained by assuming that there is no heat transfer
between the solid porous matrix and fluid (heat transfer in
parallel). This is a well-known correlation obtained by the
weighted arithmetic mean of kl and kw (keff = ukl + (1 ? u)
kw), where u is the wick porosity. A number of relations for
the prediction of keff is proposed in the literature. To inves-
tigate the effect of keff on the results, the same problem is
solved for the all-liquid wick case by using six different
correlations in addition to the weighted arithmetic mean.
These are weighted harmonic (heat transfer in series) and
geometric means of the thermal conductivities of kw
and kl, and other relations developed by Maxwell [17],
Krupiczka [18], Zehner and Schlunder [19], and Alexander
[20]. Fig. 6 represents the results obtained by using the dif-
ferent keff values at an arbitrarily chosen location of h = 80?.
The change of slope indicates the wick and fin interface. The
temperature profiles directly depend on keff. The series and
parallel arrangements represent the highest and lowest con-
ductivities, respectively. The other relations are intermedi-
ate between these two. One specific difficulty is that the
correlations produce significantly different values when
the thermal conductivities of the porous medium and fluid
are greatly different from each other as previously studied
in Nield [21]. As an example, the ratio of the thermal con-
ductivities for the liquid and vapor regions of the wick at
Tsat = 7.81 ?C are kl/kw = 0.0362 and kv/kw = 0.0017,
respectively. There is therefore further difficulty when both
of the phases are present inside the wick. A given relation
for keff will not have the same accuracy for the liquid and

the liquid-saturated wick. Because of the large density
difference between the liquid and vapor phases, the velocity
for each phase is significantly different. In plotting the
results, different scale factors are used for each phase as
shown in Fig. 7. The highest velocities occur at the small
section of the wick–groove border, which is the only out-
flow boundary for the vapor generated at the interface
inside the wick. The applied heat is carried to the vapor–
liquid interface mainly by conduction since the convection
inside the vapor zone is weak and decreases with the grow-
ing size of the vapor region. The surface evaporation on the
wick–groove border of the liquid-saturated section is
reduced in comparison to the solution obtained with the
all-liquid wick. This is due to the fact that the applied heat
directly flows to the most active region of the evaporation,
which is now at the vapor–liquid interface inside the wick.

As the applied heat load is increased, the vapor–liquid
front inside the wick continues moving away from the fin
and the size of the vapor region enlarges. Fig. 8 compares
the temperature profiles on the outer surface of the casing
for four different heat loads. In each case, not surprisingly,
the maximum temperature is reached at the mid-point on
the casing outer surface at h = 45?. The maximum temper-
ature increases with the applied heat load as expected. The
variation of (Tmax ? Tsat) as a function of the applied heat
flux is shown in Fig. 9. The temperature difference increases
with the heat load. At low heat loads, the temperature
difference is small when the wick is completely liquid filled.
The first change in slope is due to the initiation of the vapor
region under the fin and the second change in slope occurs
when the vapor region extends towards the groove past the
fin corner region. The results presented in Fig. 9 are in
good agreement with the results of the pore network model
reported in [4].

The above calculations assume that the nucleation is ini-
tiated by vapor embryo trapped in the microcavities at the
fin–wick interface. As a result, the anticipated incipience
superheats are small, on the order of 1–4 ?C. The boiling

in the wick can be delayed to higher superheats by improv-
ing the contact between the fin and wick and purifying the
working fluid to the greatest extent possible. In microchan-
nels, the superheat limit can be at the same order of mag-
nitude as that for homogenous nucleation for a pure
liquid [9]. According to Zhang et al. [24], this superheat
limit is the sufficient and necessary condition for the phase
change in microchannels. Zhang et al. [24] also explain that
the rate of phase change in microchannels is very rapid on
the order of milliseconds, resulting in explosive or flash-like
evaporation. This phenomena is not observed for macro-
channels (several hundred microns and higher), where the
rate of phase change is on the order of seconds. Without
referring to flash-like evaporation, Cao and Faghri [6] have
previously described that at high heat fluxes, the bubbles
could be expulsed at such high pressures that they may
destroy the capillary meniscus, leading to a boiling limit.
This is considered as a heat transfer limit since the wick
dry-out is associated with the nucleate boiling in the wick.
To investigate such an explosive nucleation scenario, the
superheat limit in a porous structure needs to be estimated.

Figure 1.14 – (a) Evaporation front at the outer surface of the wick and (b) within the
porous wick, Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006).

Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006) formulation allows for stabilization of the evaporation front

both at the surface as well as within the porous wick. Once the interface penetrates the

wick, forming a vapor-saturated region underneath the fin, the authors consider that the

pressure jump across the interface must be smaller than the capillary pressure and not

exactly equal, as required by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the vapor-liquid interface.

This violation is not justified.

Futhermore, the authors needed to specify a surface superheating at the fin-wick



1 Introduction 24

interface necessary to create a vapor-saturated region underneath the fin. They assumed

that once the surface temperature reaches 4 oC above the fluid saturation temperature

at the liquid inlet pressure, a vapor region forms under the fin. It is noticed that this

criterion is rather arbitrary, since it does not include the local pore size, which alters

the local thermodynamic equilibrium, and it may change depending on fluid, fluid purity,

surface roughness and assembling technique. This could be used as a resonable nucleation

hypothesis only when a gap with size larger than the nucleation bubble diameter for the

fin roughness characteristic size would exist separating the wick from the fin, which is

clearly not the case for CPLs and LHPs.

Therefore, the results of Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006) are not reliable regarding the threshold

for formation of the vapor-saturated region. Once this region is formed, the results are

an approximation for the front position, since the pressure jump has been neglected. One

interesting result presented is the difference between the outer surface temperature and

the saturation temperature in the vapor groove as a function of the applied heat flux. They

modeled a stainless-steel casing with thermal conductivity of 14.5 W/m-K and thickness

of 2 mm. The calculated temperature difference ranged from 3 to 28 oC for surface heat

flux from 1, 254 to 7, 528 W/m2.

Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006) attempt to further analyze the occurance of the boiling limit,

but this analysis is influenced by the hypothesis assumed. They conclude pointing out

that keeping a good thermal contact between the fin and the wick is more beneficial than

allowing for small gaps as suggested elsewhere (FIGUS et al., 1999).

From the background discussed above, summarized in the table in Fig. 1.15, some

authors assume that the evaporation front is located in the external surface of the wick

(CAO; FAGHRI, 1994a, 1994b; KAYA; GOLDAK, 2006). This operation condition was ver-

ified experimentally by Li &amp;amp; Ochterbeck (1999), which mentioned also that, in normal

operation, the evaporation seldom occurs within the wick. This hypothesis was assumed

by Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a, 1994b), but it was not tested theoretically. In both works, there

is no information when the vapor invades the wick. In the problem studied by Kaya &amp;amp;

Goldak (2006), the formulation allows the stabilization of the evaporation front both at

the surface as well as within the porous wick. Once the interface penetrates the wick, they

consider that the pressure jump across the interface must be smaller than the capillary

pressure and not exactly equal and this violation is not justified. Besides, they assumed

that once the surface temperature reaches 4 oC above the fluid saturation temperature at

the liquid inlet pressure, a vapor region forms under the fin. This criterion is also rather

arbitrary.

On the other hand some authors assume that the evaporation front is located within



1 Introduction 25

the wick (DEMIDOV; YATSENKO, 1994; FIGUS et al., 1999; TAKAHASHI, 2002). The model-

ing effort reported by Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994) is plenty of physical insights, however

they did not quantify the limits of heat load for their porous wick. Figus et al. (1999)

assumed that evaporation front is immersed within the porous wick. Although Figus et

al. (1999) did not correlate the threshold for the wick failure, they showed clearly the

trend of the vapor invasion-percolation process. Takahashi (2002) assumed as Figus et

al. (1999), that the evaporation front develops within the wick. The differences between

his work and the previous analysis (FIGUS et al., 1999) are the inclusion of the capillary

pressure jump at the liquid-vapor interface, the modification in a boundary condition

and a simplification in the geometry. He presented results regarding the location of the

evaporation front for different heat fluxes.

So far, it is noticed that there is a lack of information regarding the limit of the evap-

oration front location, i.e., what is the maximum heat flux that the wick can withstand

before that the evaporation front passes from external surface to inside the wick. As

mentioned before, the evaporation front can stablish a stable position within the wick,

but this condition should be avoided. Thus, the model developed here allow to deter-

mine when the evaporation front invades the porous wick, unlike the criterion assumed

by Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006) (once the surface temperature reaches 4 oC above the fluid

saturation temperature at the liquid inlet pressure, a vapor region forms under the fin).

In the present model, a reliable criterion is assumed regarding the critical heat flux based

on the maximum capillary pressure that the porous wick can withstand. In the present

model, the boundary conditions assumed by Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a, 1994b) are improved

to match better with the expected physics of the problem.

Regarding the experimental tests, most LHPs and CPLs used porous wicks made of

metal and ammonia as working fluid (which is considered the best fluid), as presented in

the previous review. The few applications of ceramic wicks in LHPs and CPLs did not

have success. Therefore, in lack of experiemental data regarding the successful application

of ceramic wicks and the use of water as working fluid in LHPs and CPLs, in this work, an

experimental study of the thermal behaviour of two LHPs and one CPL using water and

acetone as working fluid is presented. The ceramic wick manufactured by Berti (2008) is

proposed as an alternative to wicks made of metal and polymers for this application.

Figure 1.15 – Summary of the models.



1 Introduction 27

1.5 Objective

The main objectives of this thesis are twofold. The first is the development of a

mathematical model for the heat and mass transfer problem which occurs within the

porous wick of evaporators of capillary pumping systems. This model allows to verify

the effect of design variables, such as working fluids, dimensions, permeability, average

pore radius and thermal conductivity of the wick, in the performance of the capillary

evaporator and it allows for establishing a rigorous criterion for the wick dry-out limit.

The second is the application of ceramic porous wick in capillary pumping systems such

as LHPs and CPLs followed by the evaluation of their thermal behavior during the start

up and at steady state conditions for different inclinations. Water and acetone are used

as working fluids.

The thesis is divided into five chapters as follows:

1. Chapter 1 (Introduction) describes the operation of capillary pumping systems

(LHPs and CPls). It also presents a literature survey about the recent experi-

ments in CPL and LHP, the application of ceramic wick in CPLs and the recent

mathematical models for heat and mass transfer in capillary evaporators.

2. Chapter 2 (Theoretical Analisys) deals with the formulation of the heat and mass

transfer problem within porous wick of capillary evaporators. Two models are pre-

sented. One is solved analytically (Simplified Model) while the other is solved

numerically (Improved Model). The solutions aim at verifying the effect of design

variables, such as working fluids, dimensions, permeability, average pore radius and

thermal conductivity of the wick, in the performance of the capillary evaporators

and also in stablishing the criterion for dry-out.

3. Chapter 3 (Experiment) presents the manufacturing of the CPL and two LHPs.

Two tests rigs, one at Laboratory of Combustion and Thermal Systems Engineering

(LABCET) of UFSC in Brazil and the other at Institute of Nuclear Technology and

Energy Systems (IKE) of Stuttgart University in Germany, were built.

4. Chapter 4 (Experimental Results and Analysis) presents the experimental study of

the thermal behaviour of two LHPs and one CPL. Performance tests of two LHPs

using acetone and water as working fluids were carried out for power inputs up to

25 W and performance tests of one CPL using water were carried out for power

inputs up to 30 W. An analysis of the capillary limit of these systems based on their

experimental results and a comparison between the theoretical and experimental

results are also presented.



1 Introduction 28

5. Chapter 5 (Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work) presents the gen-

This chapter presents the problem formulation of the heat and mass transfer within

porous wick of capillary evaporators. For the modeling, the porous wick is a flat circular

disc and is assembled between the liquid feeding channel and the vapor chamber. Figure

2.1 presents a rendering of the porous wick modeled. The upper part of the wick is

heated by an external heat flux. The evaporation process that takes place in the wick

of the capillary evaporator depends on the applied thermal load on the system and it is

assumed that it may occur in three regimes: microfilm evaporation, evaporation at the

external surface of the wick and evaporation within the wick.

Figure 2.1 – Cross-section view of the flat capillary evaporator with cylindrical geometry.

Figure 2.2 presents a unit cell formed by a half of a single fin and the region of the

porous wick bounded by the two symmetry surfaces. In Fig. 2.2(a), an external heat

flux is supplied to the capillary evaporator and a liquid microfilm is formed between the

external surface of the porous wick and the vapor grooves as modeled by Demidov &amp;amp;

Yatsenko (1994). Since the inner surface temperature of the fin is higher than the liquid

temperature, the liquid microfilm tends to dry out. After the microfilm dries out, the

evaporation interface migrates to the external surface of the porous wick, as depicted in

Fig. 2.2(b). If the thermal load continues increasing, a capillary pressure threshold is

reached and the evaporation front moves to within the porous wick, as shown in Fig.

2.2(c). Here, only the evaporation regime in the external surface of the wick is studied.

Following Li &amp;amp; Ochterbeck (1999), this is the safest operation condition.

oration within the porous wick.

The models developed here will be used to simulate the heat and mass transfer within

a wick with one and two layers with different thermophysical properties and working fluids.

The mass and heat transfer problems are modeled by the volume averaged equations of

energy and mass conservation. Further information concerning the the volume averaging

method can be found in Appendix A.

Two models are developed. In the first model, the equations are analytically solved

using the superposition and variable separation methods. This model is based on the

model reported by Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a). An analisys on the limitations of this model

is presented. In the second model, the equations are numerically solved using the finite

volume method. This second model allows to verify the effect of design variables, di-

mensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal conductivity of the wick in the

performance of the flat capillary evaporator. Furthermore, the second model also allows

the test of the onset of drying underneath the fin, defining the limit for the operation of

the capillary evaporator.

For both models, the equations of conservation of energy and mass in volume average

were cast in cylindrical coordinates and the following assumptions were made:

? the process is steady state;

? the porous layers forming the wick are isotropic and homogeneous;

? there is a negligible influence of gravity;

? there are no heat transfer by radiation nor energy generation (besides the surface

phase change);

? the solid phase is inert and stationary;

? the fluid (liquid and its vapor) is incompressible;



2 Theoretical Analisys 31

? the thermophysical properties are constant;

? the solid phase is in local thermal equilibrium with the liquid phase;

? there are no chemical reactions.

The volume averaged equation for the conservation of mass of liquid for incompressible

fluid in cylindrical coordinates, becomes:

1

r

? (r vr)

?r
+
?vz
?z

= 0 (2.1)

Here, the volume averaged notation is omitted for simplicity. The formulation of the

conservation of linear momentum equation depends on the flow velocity. It has been

shown before (DEMIDOV; YATSENKO, 1994; CAO; FAGHRI, 1994b; FIGUS et al., 1999) that

the flow velocity in the application of interest here is small. The pore Reynolds number

can be estimated and ranges from 4.0 × 10?5 to 4.0 × 10?4. Therefore, macroscopic and
microscopic (Forchheimer) inertia terms are negligible when compared to the microscopic

viscous terms (KAVIANY, 1995). Also, since boundary effects penetrate distances that

are of the order of a few particle diameters, the macroscopic (Brinkman) viscous term is

also neglected. Finally, neglecting the influence of gravity, the r and z components of the

equation for the conservation of linear momentum reduce to Darcy’s Law, i.e.,

vr = ?

(2.2)

vz = ?

where K is the permeability and µ is the dynamic viscosity. Substituting the conservation

which reduces to a Laplace equation for the pressure when the properties are assumed

Since the fluid velocity is relativily small, the dispersion tensor can be neglected.

where ?e is the effective thermal conductivity.

The boundary conditions will be presented in the context of the two models. The first,

a simplified model, will employ a set of boundary conditions that allows an analytical

solution. The second, a more comprehensive model, will require a numerical solution.

2.1 Simplified Model

In the current section, analytical solutions for the velocity and temperature fields

within the porous wick of a flat capillary evaporator are presented. The model developed

is based on the model reported by Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a), but the properties of the porous

wicks and the working fluids used are more realistic.

The calculation domain and the boundary conditions are represented schematically in

Fig. 2.3. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the evaporator, only a section represented

by a dotted line in Fig.2.3(a) is modeled.

The boundary conditions for velocity and temperature are:

At r = 0 and r = R : vr = 0 and
?T

?r
= 0 (2.6)

At z = 0 : vz = vz,in and T = Tin (2.7)

At z = Lz and 0 ? r ? R? : vz = 0 and qin = ?e

(2.8)

At z = Lz and R

while qin is given, qout is unknown.

Following Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a), the next parameters were used for the parametriza-

tion of the conservation equations:

In this model, it is assumed that the velocity distributions at inlet vz,in and outlet vz,out

are known and uniforms. The problem is linear and the boundary conditions suggest the

use of the method of separation of variables (ARPACI, 1966). Since the governing equation

and boundary conditions are linear, the problem is subdivided into two simpler problems,

according to Fig. 2.4.

It is noticed that (vz,in) and (vz,out) still need to be determined, as it will be shown

below.

2.1.2 Analytical Solution for the Thermal Problem

For the solution of the thermal problem, qin is known and qout is calculated. The

Peclet number relates the convective and diffusive effects, and it can be written as:

Pe = Re Pr =
vz,inR

?

?e
, where ?e =

?e
?lcp,l

(2.39)

In order to evaluate the Peclet number, it is necessary to know the value of vz,in. For

that, a mass and energy balance is applied in the wick. From this balance represented in

Fig.2.5, the following expressions are obtained.

Figure 2.5 – Energy balance within the porous wick.

Assuming the inlet velocity of the liquid is distributed uniformly, we obtain,

vz,in ?=
qinAin,fin

(2.44)

The velocity and heat flux at the outlet are calculated by the following expressions:

(2.45)

?lvz,inAin,l = ?lvz,outAout,vapor ? vz,out =

(2.46)

Using Eq. 2.44 to estimate vz,in, the Peclet number (RePr) is estimated to be of

the order of 10?1 to 10?2 for the inlet heat flux from 103 to 105 W/m2 (working fluid

is water at the saturation temperature of 50 °C). Therefore, for this range of heat flux,

the convective terms in Eq. 2.14 can be neglected. With this approximation, the energy

equation is reduced to the Laplace equation,

The application of the solution above follows. First, the properties of the working

fluid, the dimensions of the wick and the inlet flux are supplied. Then, the inlet velocity

is calculated from Eq. 2.44, the heat flux at the outlet is calculated from Eq. 2.45 and the

outlet velocity is calculated from Eq. 2.46. Subsequently, these results are substituted in

Eqs. 2.36, 2.37, 2.38 and 2.49 for the calculation of the pressure, velocity components in

directions r and z and temperature fields, respectively. The equations are solved using

Maple 10 and the properties are obtained from EES (Engineering Equation Solver).

2.1.3 Results and Discussion

Results are presented here for two working fluids, water and acetone, and for three

porous wicks, stainless steel, nickel and ceramic. The properties of the wick and the

working fluids are presented in Tables 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. The effective thermal

conductivity for porous wick saturated with liquid (?e) was calculated using the correlation

magnitude of heat flux and pressure are typical of applications. The dimensions of the wick

are: R = 15 mm, R
?
= 7.5 mm, Lz = 10 mm. The velocity vectors, always perpendicular

to the isobaric lines, remain pointed upwards until the middle of the structure, where they

begin to change the direction toward the outlet of the wick due to the impermeability of

the metallic fin.

Figure 2.6 – Velocity vectors and isobaric lines in the wick for an inlet heat flux of 2.0×104
W/m2.

Figure 2.7 presents the isothermal and heat flux lines for an inlet heat flux of 2.0×104

W/m2. Note that most of the heat flows to the outlet where evaporation takes place, while

the remaining heat flows right to the feeding liquid channel. Note also that there is heat

flux from the liquid feeding channel to the vapor channel. This is a limitation of the

model which is due to the boundary conditions assumed for solving it. This limitation

will be explored further later on in this section.

Figures 2.8 presents the temperature profiles at z = Lz (surface at the vapor channel)

for the three types of wicks saturated with water and acetone, for an inlet heat flux of

2.0 × 104 W/m2. The results for water are shown in Fig. 2.8(a) and for acetone in Fig.
2.8(b) for different solid phases. It is noticed that the smaller the thermal conductivity

of the wick, the higher the temperature in the area underneath the fin. This happens



2 Theoretical Analisys 41

due to the increase in the heat transfer resistance of the porous structure. This larger

temperature can cause the formation of vapor bubbles in the area underneath the fin,

causing a possible failure by dryout. Later, a criterion for dryout will be stablished.

Figure 2.9 presents the heat fluxes at z = 0 for different thickness (Lz) and radius of

the fin (R
?
). For these results, an inlet heat flux of 2.0 × 104 W/m2, water as a working

fluid and a ceramic wick were used. It is noticed that the larger the thickness of the wick,

the smaller the heat flux to the liquid channel. Note that here the temperature at the

channel has been kept uniform at Tin. For lager heat flux there would be a superheating

of this surface which could lead to boiling. The onset of the boiling limit in the channel

will not be analyzed in this work.

The negative values of the heat fluxes, presented in Fig. 2.9 for 0 ? r ? 9 mm,
indicate that there is a heat transfer from the porous wick to the liquid feeding channel.

However these values become positive for r &gt; 9 mm. This indicates that there is a heat

transfer from the liquid feeding channel to the porous wick. This heat transfer is evident

in Fig. 2.10(a), in which it is shown that the inlet temperature is larger than the outlet

temperature in the vapor outlet of the porous wick for r &gt; 9 mm (hatched area). Figures

2.10(a) and (b) were produced using the same conditions as in Figs. 2.9(a) and (b). Figure

2.10(b) shows the heat fluxes lines from the liquid feeding channel to the vapor outlet.

Since the fin is the only source of heat in the system, this condition does not represent the

physics of the problem and it limits the model for a practical application. This is going

to be improved in the following model.

2.1.4 Conclusion

The model developed here allowed to verify the effect of design variables in the perfor-

mance of a capillary evaporator. The analysis of the different types of wicks, working fluids

and the variation of some geometric parameters provided important information such as:

the decrease of the wick thickness increased the capillary limit, however increased both

the temperature in the area close to the fin and the heat flux to the feeding liquid channel.

Also, as expected, it was noticed that the smaller the thermal conductivity of the wick,

the greater the temperatures in the area underneath the fin.

Therefore, from the variation of the parameters, thickness and thermal conductivity,

we can conclude that for a proper design of a capillary evaporator one must determine:

1. an optimum thickness and a high permeability so that the heat flux to the feeding

liquid channel is minimized and the pressure losses remain low;

2. a porous material with optimum thermal conductivity so that the temperature in

the area underneath the fin is minimized. While, at the same time, the temperature

in the surface of the liquid channel is also limited. This contradictory need was also

observed by Figus et al. (1999) that recomended the use of a double layered porous

wick.

This model allows no conclusions regarding the attainment of a capillary limit and

the boundary conditions should be improved to match better with the expected physics

of the problem. It is expected that:

1. the outlet velocity field is not uniform but it must result in higher velocities closer

to the fin;

2. the liquid channel surface temperature must be smaller than the vapor temperature.

For this improvement, the model proposed in the next section is solved numerically,

due to the nonlinearities that will appear. With this improved model, it is possible

to simulate the heat and mass transfer within the wick with more than one layer with

different thermophysical properties. This improved model will also provide a condition

for dryout.

2.2 Improved Model

This section presents an extension of the model developed in the previous section.

Here, a numerical evaluation of heat and mass transfer in the porous wick of a flat capillary



2 Theoretical Analisys 46

evaporator is presented. The model was used to simulate the heat and mass transfer within

a wick with two layers with different thermophysical properties. The model allows to verify

the effect of design variables, dimensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal

conductivity of the wick in the performance of the flat capillary evaporator. Furthermore,

the model allows the test of the onset of drying underneath the fin, defining the limit for

the application of the model which considers the wick fully saturated with liquid.

The problem domain and the boundary conditions are represented schematically in

Fig. 2.11. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the evaporator, only the section represented

by a dotted line in Fig.2.3 (a) is modeled.

Figure 2.11 – Schematic diagram of the problem domain and the boundary conditions.

In the volume-averaged equation and assuming local thermal equilibrium between the

liquid and solid phases, ?e is the effective thermal conductivity of fully liquid saturated

porous medium. For constant property, isotropic media, the conservation of thermal

energy equation reduces to a Laplace equation for the temperature. Following the system

of coordinates (r,z) depicted in Fig. 2.11, the boundary conditions are as follows.

At the surface at r = 0, cylindrical symmetry requires that:

?p

?r
= 0 and

?T

?r
= 0 (2.50)

At the surface at r = R the boundary is assumed impermeable to liquid flow and

adiabatic. Then,

?p

?r
= 0 and

?T

?r
= 0 (2.51)

At the inlet surface at z = 0, the porous wick is fed with a liquid flow with far end

temperature Tl,in, i.e.,

p = pl,in and ??e
?T

?z
+ ?lvz,incpT = ?lvz,incpTl,in (2.52)

This temperature boundary condition reflects the continuity of the total normal com-

ponent of the heat flux vector. Finally, at the outlet surface, two regions are observed.

First, underneath the metallic fin (z = Lz and 0 ? r ? R
?
),

?p

?z
= 0 and ??e

?T

?z
= qin (2.53)

Second, considering the evaporation at the outlet surface, assuming that the pore size

is not extremely small, i.e., this is not a hygroscopic porous medium, from Kelvin’s Law,

the surface temperature is approximately equal to the vapor saturation temperature in the

bulk of the vapor channel. Also, the conduction heat transfer from the fin is responsible

for the liquid evaporation. Therefore, we have,

?p

?z
=

µ?e
K?lhlv

?T

?z
and T = Tsat (pv) (2.54)

This set of boundary conditions closes the formulation. The pressure difference (pv ?
pl,in) corresponds to the total pressure loss of the CPL components. In all stable operation

points, this pressure difference balances exactly the capillary pressure difference across the

medium. The total heat transfer rate at the fin is responsible for the liquid evaporation

at the outlet surface and part of it flows to the liquid channel. A total energy balance in

the wick provides:

Qin = Qout,l + Qlv

where Qin is the heat transfer rate at the fin surface,

Qin = qinAin

The heat transfer rate to the liquid channel Qout,l, following Eq. 2.52, is given by,

Qout,l =

? R

)
rdr, at z = 0.

This heat transfer is responsible for raising the incoming flow temperature from the



2 Theoretical Analisys 48

far end value Tin to the porous wick surface value T(z = 0). Then, the heat transfer rate

actually used for the liquid evaporation is,

Qlv =

(2.55)

When Qout,l is large, the liquid in the channel can reach the onset of nucleate boiling

which is called a boiling limit for the CPL operation. In the evaporation front (liquid-vapor

interface), located in the external surface of the wick, the pressure difference between the

phases liquid and vapor is the capillary pressure, which in its turn, can be expressed

by the Young-Laplace’s equation (?pcap = pv ? pl =
2? cos ?

r
). For an averaged pore

radius rp, the capillary pressure becomes maximum when the contact angle between the

liquid and the solid approaches zero, in other words, when the wettability of the working

fluid is maximum. Since the objective here is to explore the maximum pumping capacity,

the contact angle is considered equal to zero. At the evaporation interface, the capillary

pressure is defined by the liquid and vapor pressure. Then, the average radius of curvature

of the liquid-vapor interface adjusts itself in order to balance this capillary pressure, as

predicted by Young-Laplace’s equation above. The minimum possible radius of curvature

before drying of the pore is the characteristic radius of the pore (rp). This radius depends

on the pore topology and is determined by the choice of material and manufacturing

process, i.e., sintering, used to produce the porous wicks. The maximum capillary pressure

that the wick can withstand is therefore,

?pcap,max =
2?

rp
(2.56)

This maximum capillary pressure is related to the threshold for percolation of the non-

wetting phase and is commonly identified as the wick bubbling pressure. In the operation

of a capillary evaporator, when the pressure losses of the system exceed the maximum

capillary pressure, the wick dry-out begins leading to the system failure. Therefore, the



2 Theoretical Analisys 49

capillary limit of a CPL reflects its maximum pumping capacity. Before moving to the

solution, a different nondimensionalization is proposed.

2.2.1 Nondimensional equations

Udell (1983) studied the heat and mass transfer in a problem that resembles the oper-

ation of a heat pipe. Following Udell (1983), the nondimensional variables are proposed:

pref =
?

(K/?)1/2

qref

This nondimensionalization is based on the assumption that (K/?)1/2 provides a suit-

able order of magnitude for the average pore size. From this estimative, pref is a reference

value for the liquid pressure, vref is a reference value for the liquid velocity and qref is a

reference value for the heat flux.

The nondimensional conservation equations and boundary conditions become:

The capillary-evaporation number (Ev) is the ratio of conduction heat flux to the

energy rate consumed by the evaporation of the capillary-driven liquid flow. This number

provides the relation between the nondimensional liquid pressure and temperature gradi-

ents at the evaporation surface. Also, the capillary pressure and the pore radius can be

cast in nondimensional form as,

2.2.2 Numerical Solution

The conservation equations were solved numerically by the finite volume method

(PATANKAR, 1980; MALISKA, 2004). The tri-diagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) was

employed to solve the discretized equations in a segregated form. The numerical algorithm

was implemented in FORTRAN 90 and can be summarized as:

1. First, an inlet velocity is estimated to solve the Laplace equation for the tempera-

ture. From the solution for T , the outlet velocity is calculated using the boundary

condition of Eq. 2.54.



2 Theoretical Analisys 51

2. Next, the pressure equation is solved using the outlet velocity calculated in step

(1). Then, the velocities are calculated and the values are compared to the ones

obtained in step (1);

3. Return to step (1) until the converged solution is obtained.

Convergence of the solution was examined by checking the overall mass and energy

balances. The coupled equations are assumed to converge when overall energy and mass

balances are satisfied within ± 1%. The code verification was developed according to the
method reported by Ec?a &amp;amp; Hoekstra (2008), and it was found that a grid of (150 × 150)
is sufficient to obtain accurate solutions. The uncertainty of the numerical solution was

estimated using the method developed by Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2002). The same grid of

(150×150) was chosen and the numerical uncertainty of the solutions for the temperature
and pressure fields were ±0.038 oC and ±5.443 Pa, respectively. Further information
regarding the code verification and the determination of the numerical uncertainty of the

solution can be found in Appendix B.

2.2.3 Results and Discussion

The results are presented as follows. First, the problem was solved for a porous wick

with only one layer and the results are presented for a specific inlet heat flux. Then,

three analyses are developed: analysis of the effect of the magnitude of the external heat

transfer rate in the mass flow rate, analysis of the onset of drying (one-layer) and analysis

of the effect of a bi-layered structure on the mass flow rate and onset of drying. For the

results presented here, water was used as working fluid. A ceramic wick, initially with

one layer and next with two layers with different thermal properties, was used as porous

wick. The thermodynamic properties of the wick and the working fluid and the main

nondimensional parameters are presented in Table 2.3. In the analysis that follows, the

properties were kept constant.

mensional parameters.

Figure 2.12(a) presents the streamlines and isobaric lines (Pa) for the flow within the

wick for an inlet heat flux of 4.0×104 W/m2, for water and a wick with ?e,1 = ?e,2 = 4.0
W/m-K (a uniform layer). This heat flux applied is representative of typical values found

in aeroespacial applications and in cooling electronics components of portable computers.

The dimensions of the wick are: R = 15 mm, R
?

= 7.5 mm, Lz,1 = 4 mm, Lz,2 = 6 mm.

The saturation temperature is Tsat = 40
oC at the vapor outlet and the pressure at liquid

inlet is Pl,in = 4246 Pa (Tl,in = 30
oC). The streamlines point upwards up to the middle

of the structure, where they begin to change direction towards the outlet surface of the

wick. Note that the liquid pressure is not uniform at the outlet surface, but becomes

a consequence of the normal heat flux at this surface. There is a strong curvature of

the streamlines at the end of the fin at r = R
?
. Figure 2.12(b) presents the inlet and

outlet normal velocities. Note the high velocity of the vapor flow at the end of the fin (at

r = R
?
). Actually, at r = R

?
, vz,out ? ?. This result of the velocity at r = R

does not

match with the expected physics of the problem. Indeed, there is a no-slip condition at

the wall of the fin and would be necessary to include in the momentum equation (Darcy’s

Law) the macroscopic (Brinkman) viscous term for taking into account this phenomenon.

However, to some extend, as the velocities are so low, this contribuition would not affect

the temperature and pressure fields obtained with the model.

Figure 2.13(a) presents the isotherm and heat flux lines for an inlet heat flux of

4.0×104 W/m2. Note that part of the heat flows to the outlet where evaporation occurs,
while the remaining flows right to the feeding liquid channel. Fig. 2.13(b) presents the

temperature distribution at outlet and inlet for the same inlet heat flux used for Fig.

2.11(a). The inlet temperature presents a maximum variation of 0.02 oC for all results

obtained. These figures should be compared to Fig. 2.10 for the simplified model. We

note a markedly different temperature distribution for the region underneath the channel.

From this general view, more specific aspects will be presented using the nondimen-

sional variables.

2.2.4 Effect of the magnitude of the external heat transfer rate in the
mass flow rate

It is expected that an increase in the heat flux at the fin causes an increase in the mass

flow rate. Figures 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 present the nondimensional isotherm and heat flux

lines for three increasing heat fluxes. Fig. 2.14 presents the results for a nondimensional

inlet heat flux of 5.0. The fin ends at r? = 0.5. The isotherm with T? = 1.0 (T = Tv) is

also shown. Note that surface evaporation occurs only in the first few millimeters of the

outlet surface, very close to the end of the fin. For the remaining of the fin, the heat flux

lines turn around and heat flows right to the liquid channel. As the nondimensional heat

flux is increased (Figs. 2.15 and 2.16), an increased amount of heat flows to the outlet

surface, causing the liquid evaporation. When the heat flux is increased, the isotherm

T? = 1.0 penetrates deeper in the porous wick.

Figure 2.14 – Nondimensional isotherm and heat flux lines for a nondimensional inlet heat
flux of 5.0 (qin = 2.0 × 104 W/m2).

This is also evidenced in Fig. 2.17 that presents the normal nondimensional liquid

velocity at the outlet surface. The area underneath the curve shown is proportional to

the mass flow rate which, given the boudary conditions, is simply calculated by
qinAin
hlv

.

Since the normal velocity at the region underneath the fin is zero, Fig. 2.17 shows only

the vapor outlet surface (z? = 1.0 and 0.5 ? r? ? 1.0). Except for a region closer to the
fin, the nondimensional liquid velocity at the outlet surface is not very sensitive to the

heat flux.

flux of 37.5 (qin = 1.5 × 105 W/m2).

2.2.5 Analysis of the Onset of Drying

The heat transfer rate imposed in the fin is transferred to the outlet surface, causing

evaporation, and also to the inlet surface, resulting in heating of the liquid channel. Both

these heat transfer paths have their characteristic thermal resistances. As a result of these

thermal resistances, the fin surface reaches a temperature which can be reasonably large

in certain conditions. For instance in Fig. 2.16, we observe that for a nondimensional inlet

heat flux of 37.5, the fin surface reaches nondimensional temperatures above 15 which are



2 Theoretical Analisys 57

Figure 2.17 – Normal nondimensional liquid velocity at the outlet surface as a function

about 14 times above the nondimensional saturation temperature of the fluid (for infinite

radius of curvature). Then, a question remains whether the fluid would remain liquid or

evaporate under this temperature. This can be tested by observing the capillary pressure

at the top surface of the wick and comparing it to the maximum capillary pressure that

the wick can sustain.

The maximum capillary pressure that a pore with radius rp can sustain is,

?pcap,max =
2?

rp

This can be nondimensionalized using Eq. 2.59 resulting in,

?p?cap,max =
2? (K/?)

1/2

?rp
=

2 (K/?)
1/2

rp
(2.61)

Note that this maximum nondimensional capillary pressure is a purely geometrical

parameter. Therefore, the maximum nondimensional capillary pressure is the one that

exists for a pore with radius equal to 2 (K/?)
1/2

. When applied to a porous wick, this

means that the maximum capillary pressure is the one that occurs when the average

radius of the curvature of all menisci exposed to the vapor phase is equal to rp.

The local nondimensional capillary pressure at the outlet surface is given by equation

Eq. 2.59 (repeated here)

where pv = psat(Tv) and pl is the local value of liquid pressure calculated from the improved

model, pl = pl(r) at z = Lz. Here, ? = ?(T) where T is the porous wick temperature.

Fig. 2.18 presents the nondimensional capillary pressure at the top surface as a

function of properties for two heat fluxes, q?in = 10.5 and q
?
in = 5.0. All properties were

kept constant and correspond to the properties of the porous wick with nondimensional

average pore radius of 11.34. The horizontal lines represent the maximum nondimensional

capillary pressure for each characteristic nondimensional pore size, from 11.34 to 56.69 as

shown. We note that for the nondimensional inlet heat flux of 5.0 all media would remain

saturated by liquid except those with the larger nondimensional pores of 37.80 and 56.69.

For these two sizes, the local capillary pressure exceeds the maximum allowed capillary

pressure and, therefore, the region underneath the fin would dry and the evaporation front

would seek a new equilibrium position within the wick. This condition in which the front

is embedded within the wick has been analyzed by Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko (1994), Figus et

al. (1999), Takahashi (2002) and Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006).

Figure 2.18 – Nondimensional capillary pressure profiles at z? = 1.0 for different nondi-
mensional averaged radius of curvature and nondimensional inlet heat fluxes.

For higher heat fluxes, all media with pore sizes above 11.34 would suffer dry out



2 Theoretical Analisys 59

underneath the fin. Therefore, there is a relation between the pore size (and all medium

properties) and the heat flux at the onset of drying. Note that this drying underneath the

fin may not cause the failure by the capillary limit, since there may be a stable condition

for operation with the embedded evaporation front according to Demidov &amp;amp; Yatsenko

(1994), Figus et al. (1999), Takahashi (2002) and Kaya &amp;amp; Goldak (2006). This, however,

is not analyzed here. Nevertheless, this test allows the definition of safe operation limits.

2.2.6 Analysis of the Onset of Drying in the Bi-layered Structure

Here, the analysis of the porous wick with two layers is presented. It is expected that

this kind of porous structure improves the capillary pumping capacity, avoiding reaching

the capillary limit. It is also expected that the heat transfer to the feeding liquid channel

is decreased. For the bi-layered porous wick, porous wick 1 and 2 have nondimensional

lengths of L?z,1 = 0.4 and L
?
z,2 = 0.6, respectively. The porous wick 2 has the effective

thermal conductivity constant (?e,2 = 4.0 W/m ? K). The effective thermal conductivity
of the porous wick 1 was varied (?e,1) from 6.0 W/m-K (two-layers I) to 8.0 W/m-K

(two-layers II) in order to evaluate its effect on the onset of drying.

Figure 2.19 presents the nondimesnional capillary pressure at the top surface as a

function of properties of the wicks with one and two layers for a nondimensional inlet

heat flux of 10.5 and four characteristic nondimensional pore average radius (from 11.34

to 56.69). All properties were also kept constant and correspond to the nondimensional

average porous radius of 11.34. Note that for the nondimensional inlet heat flux of 10.5 in

the wick with two layers, as the thermal conductivity increase the local capillary pressure

decreases and may not exceed the maximum allowed capillary pressure.

For a given nondimensional heat flux there will be a local maximum nondimensional

average radius needed to avoid the drying of the wick in the region underneath the fin,

which will be called critical nondimensional average radius (r?p,crit). From Eq. 2.59 and

2.60, this is given by,

r?p,crit =
2?

(pv ?pl) (K/?)
1/2

(2.62)

where pv = psat(Tv) and pl is the local value of liquid pressure calculated from the improved

model, pl = pl(r) at z = Lz. Here, ? = ?(T) where T is the porous wick temperature.

Figures 2.20 and 2.21 depict curves of critical nondimensional average radius as a

function of the nondimensional heat flux in the upper part of the wick (z? = 1). Figure

2.20 presents the nondimensional critical average radius for two nondimensional heat



2 Theoretical Analisys 60

fluxes (5.0 and 10.5) for the porous wick with one layer.

Figure 2.20 – Critical nondimensional average radius profiles at z? = 1.0 for two nondi-
mensional inlet heat fluxes, one layer.

This is the same condition presented in Figs. 2.14 and 2.15. Note that, in the region

underneath of the fin, the smaller the nondimensional heat flux the higher the critical

nondimensional average radius. That is, the temperatures underneath the fin and the mass



2 Theoretical Analisys 61

flow rate decrease with the decreasing of heat flux. As a consequence the capillary pressure

also decreases. Since the critical average radius is inversely proportional to the maximum

capillary pressure according Eq. 2.62, when the nondimensional heat flux is decreased the

critical nondimensional average radius increases. For the nondimensional heat flux of 10.5

the porous wick should be manufactured with minimum critical nondimensional average

radius of 10.86 (rp = 2.87 µm calculated for the properties from Table 2.3), while for

nondimensional heat flux of 5.0 it is sufficient a minimum critical nondimensional average

radius of 32.18 (rp = 8.51 µm calculated for the properties from Table 2.3).

It is noted in Fig. 2.21 that for the same nondimensional heat flux of 10.2, as the ther-

mal conductivity of the wick 1 increases, the minimum critical nondimensional average

radius also increases in the region underneath the fin. The minimum critical nondimen-

sional average radius is 32.18 (two-layers II - ?e,1 = 8.0 W/m ? K), 21.86 (two-layers I -
?e,1 = 6.0 W/m ? K) and 10.86 (one-layer). Therefore, these results provide guidelines
for the design and manufacture of the porous wicks in order to avoid the drying of the

region underneath the fin.

Figure 2.21 – Critical nondimensional average radius profiles at z? = 1.0 in the bi-layered
wick for a nondimensional inlet heat flux of 10.5.

It is noticed in Figs. 2.20 and 2.21 that the minimum critical nondimensional average

radius is located in the region underneath of the fin at z? = 1.0 and r? = 0.0. Thus,

the Fig. 2.22 presents the critical nondimensional average radius as a function of the

nondimensional heat flux at z? = 1.0 and r? = 0.0.

The curve shown in Fig. 2.22(a) represents the capillary limit, i.e., bellow this curve

the capillary limit is not reached and there is no vapor breakthrough and above the curve

occurs the vapor invasion of the porous wick. Figure 2.22(b) presents the minimum critical

nondimensional average radius as a function of the nondimensional heat flux for a bi-

layered wick. Note that, as the thermal conductivity of the wick 1 increases, the capillary

limit is displaced and the minimum critical nondimensional average radius also increases.

For a minimum critical nondimensional average radius (r?p,crit) of 20, for instance, the

nondimensional heat flux increases from 7.5 (one layer) to 15 (bi-layered) which refer to



2 Theoretical Analisys 63

a heat flux of 3 × 104 W/m2 and 6 × 104 W/m2, respectively.

2.2.7 Conclusions

The model developed here allowed to verify the effect of design variables in the steady-

state performance of a flat capillary evaporator. The model simulated the heat and mass

transfer within a wick with one and two layers with different thermophysical properties.

Also, a criterion for the onset of dryout was obtained and calculated for the conditions

simulated.

The analysis of the wick with one and two layers showed that the wick with two

layers is better than with one layer regarding the onset of drying underneath the fin.

Other conclusions are:

1. The capillary limit, or onset drying, stablishes a relation between the pore size (and

all medium properties) and the heat flux. If this limit is reached, the evaporation

front may penetrate within the wick. This can be used as a criterium for the

specification of the maximum heat flux allowed during operation in steady-state.

2. The larger the thermal conductivity of the porous wick 1 (underneath the fin), the

smaller is the heat transfer to the feeding channel, causing a smaller increase of the

inlet temperature. The increase of the thermal conductivity of the porous wick 1

causes the increase of the capillary limit, avoiding the onset of drying of the region

underneath the fin. The increase of the thermal conductivity also decreases the

mass flow rate, causing the decrease of the pressure losses through the porous wick.

3. Finally, the dimensions of the bi-layered wick (R = 15 mm, R
?

= 7.5 mm, Lz,1 = 4

mm, Lz,2 = 6 mm) and its thermophysical properties can be used for a design of a

flat capillary evaporator.

From the understanding developed from the theoretical analysis, two LHPs and one

CPL were designed, fabricated and tested under conditions typical of aerospacial appli-

cations.

However, the attempts to produce a flat capillary evaporator where not succesful due

to sealing difficulties in the region between the wick and the casing. Therefore, it was

decided to follow the work producing cylindrical capillary evaporators. Besides the change

in geometries, the same general principles described above apply.

In this work two LHPs and one CPL were manufactured and tested in order to evaluate

their thermal performance and their applicability in thermal control of microprocessors

and electronic components in general. The surface temperatures at the main part of the

systems, e.g. evaporator and condenser inlet and outlet, compensation chamber (in case

of LHPs) and reservoir (in case of CPL) were measured while the thermal load was varied.

The LHPs used acetone and water as working fluid, while the CPL only used water. The

LHPs and the CPL used a ceramic porous wick as capillary structure in the evaporator.

For the heating of the capillary evaporator of LHPs and CPL, electric resistors (cartridge

heaters inside of copper block for the LHPs and heaters in format of wire for the CPL) were

used to simulate the heat generation in microprocessors and electronic components. The

condensers of the LHPs were cooled using water in forced convection and the condenser

of CPL was cooled using air also in forced convection.

The CPL and LHPs used here were manufactured at Federal University of Santa

Catarina (UFSC) in Brazil. All tests of the CPL were carried out at Laboratory of

Combustion and Thermal Systems Engineering (LABCET) of UFSC in Brazil and all

tests of LHPs were carried out at Institute of Nuclear Technology and Energy Systems

(IKE) at University of Stuttgart in Germany, under the supervision of Researcher Dr.

Rainer Mertz.

3.2 Ceramic Porous Wick Manufacturing

Most porous structures used in the evaporators of LHPs and CPLs are made of metallic

sintered powders, such as nickel, titanium and stainless steel. Metallic wicks have lower

thermal resistance when compared to polymeric and ceramic porous wicks. Although

this comes as an advantage for heat transfer to the evaporation front, they also transfer a

considerable quantity of heat from the evaporation zone to the inlet liquid channel, leading



3 Experiment 65

to formation of bubbles that block the liquid feeding channel. Moreover, the machining

of porous metal structures can block the external pores and hence reduce the liquid flow.

In this work, ceramic porous wicks are proposed as alternative to wicks made of metallic

material for all capillary evaporators in order to minimize the bubble formation inside the

liquid feed channel and problems in the machining of the wick. According to Janssen et

al. (2008) ceramic wick structure can be machined by conventional machining processes

and the porosity remains opened up to surface.

Here, slip casting was used to produce the porous structures. The following materials

were used in the formulation of the ceramic powder: mullite (Treibacher 140F, Brazil)

and alumina (Alcoa SG1000, 90% &amp;lt;44µm, Brazil). Activated carbon (Carbomafra,

90% &amp;lt;44µm, Brazil) was used as pore forming agent to increase the porosity of the

porous elements. Aqueous slurries (67wt% solids content, corresponding to 80wt% mullite

and 20wt% of alumina) were prepared. The pore forming agent was then added (10wt%

in relation to the solids content). Chemical additives (sodium polyacrylate as dispersant,

and poly(vinyl-alcohol) as plasticizer) were used to stabilize the slurries. The slurries

were then submitted to a grinding process to decrease particle size and after grinding, the

slurries were poured into plaster moulds. Subsequently, the samples were pre-sintered at

1200oC for 1 h to remove the pore forming agent, followed by sintering at 1450oC for 1 h,

(BERTI et al., 2010).

Figure 3.1 shows the ceramic wick with vapor channels (grooves) used in the evapo-

rators of LHPs and CPL. Only four grooves were machined in the ceramic wick used for

the LHPs, Fig. 3.1(a). Along the work the machining technique was improved and it was

possible to machine more vapor channels (12 grooves) in the ceramic wick used for the

CPL, Fig. 3.1(b). A thermal cleaning at 800oC for 120 min is applied to remove the oil

contamination after the machining.

3.3 Manufacturing of the LHPs and the CPL

During the assembly of the capillary evaporator, the insertion of porous wicks into

the metallic envelope must result in close contact tolerances between envelope walls and

wick surface. This contact should be tight in order to avoid any vapor leak back to the

liquid channel. The assembling of metallic wicks requires at the same time the heating of

the metallic tube and cooling of the wick for the insertion into the metallic envelop. The

ceramic wick is not cooled due to its low volumetric thermal expansion coefficient when

compared to those of metals. Therefore, only the metallic envelop of the evaporator is

heated at ? 800oC for the insertion of the ceramic wick.

Figure 3.2(a) depicts a view of the evaporator, the compensation chamber and the

ceramic porous wick of the LHPs. Only the upper side of the capillary evaporator has

grooves. Figure 3.2(b) shows a view of the evaporator and the ceramic porous wick of the

CPL. Contrary to the wicks for LHPs, all the circumference of capillary evaporator for

the CPL has grooves.

3.4 Description of the LHPs

Two LHPs were manufactured with the same capillary evaporator. Fig. 3.3 shows the

LHPs. Both capillary evaporators have 10 mm of inner diameter and 25 mm of length.

The ceramic porous wick has 50% of porosity, 1 to 3 µm pore size distribution and

permeability of about 1.5 × 10?14 m2; a compensation chamber with the same diameter
of the evaporator and length of 50 mm; transport lines of liquid and vapor with 2.8 mm

of inner diameter and the condenser with 120 mm of length. The lengths of the vapor



3 Experiment 67

and liquid transport lines of the two LHPs have small differences, which are presented in

the Table 3.1.

 

Figure 3.3 – General view of the LHP (acetone) and LHP (water) with cylindrical evap-
orators.

The properties of the ceramic porous wick, obtained in Berti (2008), and the working

fluids are presented in Table 3.2.

3.4.1 Filling Station

The ammount of working fluid has a significant influence on the operation of capillary

pumping systems, hence it is necessary to control carefully the amount of fluid inserted

in these systems. Figure 3.4 shows the filling station used in the filling of LHPs which is

composed by one vaccum pump conection, four valves and one burette. First, the valves

1 and 3 are opened while the valves 2 and 4 are closed. Next the conection between the

vaccum pump and the LHP is evacuated. After reaching the required vaccum, the valve

4 is opened in order to evacuate the LHP. After reaching the required vaccum level in the

LHP, the valves 1 and 4 are closed and the valve 2 is opened. Again the valve 4 is opened

carefully until the desired volume of liquid is fed to the LHP.

The working fluid charge ratio of LHP working with water was varied in the range

from 50 to 65% in steps of 5%, while for the LHP working with acetone the working fluid

charge ratio was set at 50, 60, 65 and 70%. A working fluid charge ratio of 60% means that

the LHP is filled with 60% of its total volume including the compensation chamber. The

the steady state condition.

3.4.2 Experimental Apparatus

Figure 3.5 shows the instrumentation used for testing the LHPs. The LHP with the

heat source, the heat sink and the temperature sensors were fixed to a movable frame in

order to adjust the orientation to different angles. The whole construction is embedded

into a box made of Plexiglas (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 m3), where different ambient conditions

can be set. The box is insulated to avoid as much as possible heat transfer between the

box and the ambient. Flanges are employed at the front side and at the top of the box,

so that the experimental components inside the box can be set easily to the requested

experimental conditions. Several feedthroughs are employed to connect the lines for the

measurement sensors and the heating and cooling devices.

The power supply unit is connected to the cartridge heaters and is controlled by

the data logger. A thermostat controls the temperature of the coolant at the condenser

section. The volumetric flow rate of the coolant working fluid (water) is measured by a

magnetic inductive flow meter. Two resistant temperature sensors (Pt100) measure the

inlet and outlet coolant temperature. The temperature inside the box is set by a cryostat.

A resistant temperature sensor (Pt100) located near the LHP is connected to the cryostat,

measuring the input temperature for the loop control of the cryostat. Furthermore there

are three more resistant temperature sensors (Pt100) measuring the ambient temperature

inside the box placed near the top, in the middle and at the bottom. All signals are

measured by a data logger including the room ambient temperature which is measured

by a resistant temperature sensor (Pt100). Figure 3.6 depicts the external view of the

test rig.

The temperature distribution along the LHP was measured using thermal resistors

(Pt100). Figure 3.7 depicts the locations of the temperature sensors: evaporator out-

let (TEvap,out), condenser inlet (TCond,in), condenser outlet (TCond,out), evaporator inlet

(TEvap,in) and the compensation chamber (TCC).

3.4.3 Cooling and Heating Systems

The capillary evaporators of the LHPs were heated using two cartridge heaters inserted

into a copper block. The heat sink of the LHPs, which used water as working fluid, were

cooled by a thermostat. Figure 3.8 presents the LHP with the condenser box attached to

it, the copper block and the cartridge heaters attached to the capillary evaporator of one

of the LHPs.

Figure 3.8 – View of one of the LHPs, showing the heating system and the condenser box.

3.4.4 Experimental Procedure

The LHPs were first adjusted to inclinations of interest and the box ambient tem-

perature was set. Once all temperatures of the LHP showed the same value as the box

ambient temperature (?Tmax = 1
oC), the first power input step of 5 W was applied to the

evaporator. Once all temperatures reached a stationary value (or oscillating stationary

value), the power input was increased by steps of 5 W. The electrical power (Pel) applied



3 Experiment 72

to the cartridge was calculated by measuring the current and the voltage accross it. As-

suming no heat losses through the insulation at the heating zone, the applied electrical

power is taken as the heat applied to the LHP. The performance tests were carried out

for power inputs ranging from 5 to 25 W for the LHP (Acetone) and ranging from 5 to

15 W for the LHP (Water), taking into account the changes in the heat sink temperature

and different slopes for the LHPs.

3.4.5 Analysis of Experimental Uncertainties

For LHP, including the accuracy of the temperature sensors and the uncertainties

of the data logger, the uncertainty of the temperature is estimated at ±0.41 oC. The
uncertainty of the electrical power input is estimated at ±0.12 W including the uncertainty
of the power supply unit and the uncertainty of the data logger. Further information

concerning the estimative of the experimental uncertainty can be found in Appendix C.

3.5 Description of the CPL

One CPL was manufactured, Fig. 3.9, with the following characteristics: capillary

evaporator has 10 mm of inner diameter and 50 mm of length; the same ceramic porous

wick used for the LHPs were used; transport lines of liquid and vapor have 2.8 mm of inner

diameter and the condenser has 385 mm of length. The main structural characteristics of

the CPL are presented in Table 3.3.

A similar filling process as for LHP is used for the filling of the CPL using another

filling station that is shown in Fig. 3.10.

For the CPL the total volume does not take into account the reservoir volume, there-

fore the working fluid charge ratio was tested with 120 and 130%. A working fluid charge

ratio of 100% means that only the loop is filled and the reservoir is empty.



3 Experiment 74

3.5.2 Experimental Apparatus

The temperature distribution along the CPL was measured using temperature sen-

sors (thermocouples type T). Figure 3.11 depicts the locations of the temperature sen-

sors: evaporator (TEvap), evaporator outlet (TEvap,out), vapor line (TV aporLine), condenser

inlet (TCond,in), condenser (TCond), condenser outlet (TCond,out), evaporator inlet (TEvap,in),

reservoir (TRes) and reservoir outlet (TRes,out).

3.5.3 Cooling and Heating Systems

Figure 3.12 presents the CPL with the air cooling system at the condenser section,

the heating system of the capillary evaporator and reservoir and the pressure sensor. Two

air coolers with fins were used to cool the condenser section as shown in Fig. 3.12(a).

3.5.4 Experimental Procedure

The CPL was adjusted to the orientation of interest (horizontal position) and the

room temperature was measured. Once all temperatures of the CPL showed almost the

same value as the ambient temperature (?Tmax = 1
o C), the first power input step of 5

W was applied to the evaporator. Once all temperatures reached a stationary value (or

oscillating stationary value), the power input was increased by steps of 5 W. The electrical

power (Pel) applied to the electric heater was calculated by measuring the voltage and

the current which pass through the wire. Assuming no heat losses through the insulation

at the heating zone, the applied electrical power is taken as the thermal heat applied to

the CPL. The performance tests of the CPL were carried out for power inputs ranging

from 5 to 30 W.

3.5.5 Analysis of Experimental Uncertainties

For the CPL, the uncertainty of the measurements were estimated for the temperature,

power input and pressure. Taking into account the accuracy of the temperature sensors

(thermocouples type T) and the uncertainties of the data logger (Agilent 34970A with

20 channels), the uncertainty of the temperature measured was estimated at ±1.8 oC.
The uncertainty of the electrical power input was estimated at ±0.28 W including the
uncertainty of the power supply unit and the uncertainty of the data logger (Agilent

N6700B). The experimental uncertainty of pressure sensor was estimated as ±345.22 Pa.
Further information regarding the estimation of the experimental uncertainties can also

be found in Appendix C.

4 Experimental Results and
Analysis

This chapter presents the results of the thermal behaviour of two LHPs and one CPL.

Performance tests of two LHPs using acetone and water as working fluids were carried

out for power inputs up to 25 W and performance tests of one CPL using water were

carried out for power inputs up to 30 W. An analisys of the results is developed regarding

the startup and operation of the systems for different working fluid inventory, heat sink

temperature and inclination. Besides, an analisys of the capillary limit for all systems and

a comparison between the experimental and theoretical (modeling presented in Chapter

2) results are also presented.

4.1 Results of LHP with Acetone

4.1.1 The Working Fluid Inventory and Startup

A successful startup is mainly related to the applied heat load, heat sink temperature

and working fluid inventory. Figure 4.1 shows the start up for 50, 60, 65 and 70% working

fluid charge ratios, under heat load of 10 W and condenser positioned 90o above the

evaporator. This position is more favorable to the operation of the LHP because the

liquid flows to the evaporator due to the capillary and also to the gravity action. Besides,

it can be sure that the evaporator is full filled with liquid before start-up.

In Fig. 4.1(a), after approximately 60 s, the inlet condenser temperature (Tcond,in)

increases fast, indicating that the vapor front reached the condenser. At 130 s, however,

the temperature starts to decrease, indicating that the system failed to start up. This

sudden decrease is caused by lack of working fluid along the loop. So, there is not enough

liquid flow to the capillary evaporator. As a consequence of no evaporation of liquid, the

outlet temperature of evaporator increases continuously. A similar behavior is presented

in Fig. 4.1(b), where the system failed at approximately 275 s.

A successful startup occurred for 65% working fluid charge ratio, shown in Fig. 4.1(c).



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 77

(c) 65% (d) 70%

Figure 4.1 – Startup under heat load of 10 W and condenser positioned 90° above the
evaporator for different working fluid charge ratios.

The outlet evaporator and the inlet condenser temperatures reached a steady state con-

dition at 68 and 56 oC, respectively. A faster start up was achieved for 70% working fluid

charge ratio. Now the outlet evaporator and the inlet condenser temperatures reached

the steady state condition at 52 and 47 oC, respectively. Note that there is a temperature

difference in the operation temperature (Tevap,out) of 16
oC between the cases (c) and (d).

So, the fluid inventory plays also an important role regarding the operating temperature

of the LHP. The startup was not successful for working fluid charge ratio smaller than 60%

and there was no significant decrease of operation temperature for working fluid charge

ratios higher than 70%.

4.1.2 Temperatures of LHP (acetone) as a Function of Heat Load

Figure 4.2 depicts the temperatures of the evaporator outlet (Tevap,out), condenser inlet

(Tcond,in), condenser outlet (Tcond,out), evaporator inlet (Tevap,in) and the compensation

chamber (TCC) at horizontal position and heat sink temperature of 20
oC for stepwise

increase in heat flux.

Figure 4.2 – Temperatures of LHP (acetone) for heat loads increasing at horizontal posi-
tion and at heat sink temperature of 20 oC.

The LHP (acetone) worked satisfactorily in the power range from 5 to 25 W. The

limit temperature of 100 oC (assumed for safety reasons) was reached for 25 W power in-

put. Contrarily to capillary pumped loops, the temperature of the compensation chamber

(TCC) is not constant, as shown in Fig. 4.2, changing from 29 to 51
oC. The measured out-

let evaporator temperature was higher, from 50 to 98 oC, and the temperature difference

to the heat sink temperature (20 oC) varied from 30 to 78 oC.

4.1.3 Heat Sink Temperature

For low heat loads the evaporator temperature is high. As the heat load increases, the

evaporator temperature decreases until a minimum value is reached. This region is called

the variable conductance mode. Afterwards it starts to increase linearly, characterizing

the fixed conductance mode. Experimental studies exploring this phenomenon have been

reported in Chen et al. (2006), Ku (1999) and Chuang (2003). Their results showed that



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 79

the heat sink temperature influences the operation temperature of LHP only when it is

much lower than the ambient temperature.

Figure 4.3 presents the outlet evaporator temperatures for 10 and 20 W for the LHP

in horizontal position, using acetone as working fluid and heat sink temperatures varying

from 10 to 40 oC. With exception the value for heat load of 10 W under heat sink

temperature of 10 oC, there is a small difference, mostly within the uncertainty level,

between the outlet evaporator temperatures when the heat sink temperature changes for

both heat loads. Since the heat sink temperature is approximately equal to the ambient

temperature, it was not possible to state anything concerning the conductance mode.

Figure 4.3 – Outlet evaporator temperatures of the LHP (acetone) for heat loads of 10
and 20 W at horizontal position and at heat sink temperatures of 10, 20, 30 and 40 oC.

4.1.4 Inclination of the LHP

Four different scenarios were analyzed: (i) evaporator positioned 90o above the con-

denser; (ii) condenser positioned 90o above the evaporator, according to Fig. 4.4; (iii)

evaporator positioned 10o above the condenser; (iv) condenser positioned 10o above the

evaporator.

Figure 4.5 depicts the outlet evaporator temperature of LHP (acetone) for heat loads

ranging from 10 to 20 W. As expected, due to the position effect of thermobuoyancy on the

mass flow rate, the lowest outlet evaporator temperature was measured for the condenser

positioned 90o above the evaporator. On the other hand, the highest temperature was

measured for the evaporator positioned 90o above the condenser.

4.2 Results of LHP with Water

4.2.1 The Working Fluid Inventory and Startup

Figure 4.6 shows the start up for 50, 55, 60 and 65% working fluid charge ratios, under

heat load of 10W and at horizontal position. The startup was successful for working fluid

charge ratio of 60%. In Fig. 4.6(a) the temperature of condenser inlet increases but does

not reach a stationary state and after 800 s the system fails. This elapsed time until



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 81

failure increases as the working fluid charge ratio increases, as it can seen in Figs. 4.6(a)

and (b). It took 1500 and 2250 s for system failure in case of 55 and 60% working fluid

charge ratios, respectively. Finally, the successful startup was reached for 65% working

fluid charge ratio, Fig. 4.6(d).

4.2.2 Temperatures of LHP (water) as a Function of Heat Load

Figure 4.7 depicts the loop temperatures, measured in the same positions as in the

LHP with acetone, for the LHP with water at horizontal position and at heat sink tem-

perature of 20 oC. The LHP (water) worked satisfactorily in the range from 5 to 15 W,

as shown in Fig. 4.7. The maximum operation temperature was again set to 100 oC for

safety reasons. The outlet evaporator temperature reached higher temperatures ranging



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 82

from 60 to 100 oC, and the temperature difference to the heat sink temperature (20 oC),

varied from 40 to 80 oC.

Figure 4.7 – Temperatures of LHP (water) for heat loads increasing at horizontal position
and at heat sink temperature of 20 oC.

4.2.3 Heat Sink Temperature

Figure 4.8 presents outlet evaporator temperatures for 5, 10 and 15 W at horizontal

position, considering water as working fluid and heat sink temperatures varying from 10

to 40 oC. For low heat load (5 W) there is a small difference between the temperatures.

As the heat load increases, this difference increases and reaches up to 10.3 oC. Again,

since the heat sink temperature is approximately equal to the ambient temperature, it is

not possible to state anything concerning the conductance mode.

4.2.4 Inclination of the LHP

Figure 4.9 shows the outlet evaporator temperature of LHP (water) for heat loads

from 5 to 15 W. The lowest outlet evaporator temperature was also measured for the

condenser positioned 90o above the evaporator. The highest temperature was measured

for evaporator positioned 10o above the condenser and the LHP did not start up for

evaporator positioned 90o above the condenser.

and 15 W at different slopes and at heat sink temperature of 20 oC.

4.3 Comparision between LHP with Water and Ace-

tone

Here, the results of two LHPs using water and acetone are compared. The Tab. 4.3

presents the time for the startup corresponding to the results shown in Figs. 4.1 and 4.6.



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 84

It is noticed that the time for startup for the LHP using acetone was lower than the LHP

using water. To some extent, this difference between the time for the startup can be due

to several factor such as thermal properties and purity of the working fluid, filling and

manufactoring of the LHPs and so on.

? R is the working fluid charge ratio.
?? t is the startup time.

Figure 4.10 presents the temperatures of the evaporator outlet of the LHPs using

acetone and water as a function of the heat load in horizontal position. It was observed a

difference between the operation temperatures in the experiments using water and acetone

varing from 13 oC at the lowest load to 33 oC at the highest load. To some extent, this

difference can be due to the vapor pressure and/or the thermal inertia (startup time). The

vapor pressure of acetone is lower than the water and, as a consquence, the evaporation

temperature should be lower. The time of startup for the LHP with acetone is lower

than with water, so the LHP with water takes more time to reach the stabilization of its

operation temperature, causing an increase in temperatures of the system.

A small temperature difference between the evaporator outlet and the heat sink is

required for a successful application of these LHPs. Therefore, high temperature differ-

ences claim for changes in the properties of the ceramic porous wick (porosity, pore size

and thermal conductivity) or improvements in the original LHP design. A total thermal

resistance, following Maydanik &amp;amp; Vershinin (2009), can be defined as,

Rtotal =
(TEvap ?THS)

Q?evap
, (4.1)

where THS is the heat sink temperature, i.e., the average cooling temperature. Here

TEvap,out was used instead of TEvap, since it was not possible in the set up developed to

fix a thermoresistor at the interface between the copper block heater and the evaporator.

This resistance plays the role of a relative measure of the LHP effectiveness. When

the same system operates with two different fluids, the conditions that lead to minimum

resistance imply a higher heat transfer capacity per degree of temperature difference.

Figure 4.10 – Outlet evaporator temperatures of the LHPs with acetone and water for
heat loads of 5, 10 and 15 W at horizontal position and at heat sink temperature of 20
oC.

Figure 4.11 depicts the total thermal resistance for the LHPs for both water and acetone.

It is noticed that the total thermal resistance for the LHP using water is higher than with

acetone. This difference is due to the higher temperatures in the evaporator outlet, as it

was explained before. For the measurements made, from 5 to 25 W, the total thermal

resistance was maximum for a heat load of 5 W (8.2 oC/W for LHP using water and 5.7

oC/W for LHP using acetone) and it was minimum for a heat load of 20 W (2.9 oC/W

for LHP using acetone). The operation with water leaded to a minimum total thermal

resistance of 5.3 oC/W for a heat load of 15 W. The smaller the total thermal resistance,

the greater the heat transfer between the hot (evaporator surface) and cold (heat sink)

sources of the LHP for a given temperature difference.

4.4 Results of CPL with Water

4.4.1 The Working Fluid Inventory and Startup

The set point temperature of the reservoir controls the CPL operating temperature

regardless of changes in the heat load or heat sink temperature as long as the reservoir

is in a two phase condition. For that, the amount of working fluid in the loop should be

sufficient so that at minimum heat load and minimum sink temperature, the condenser

is almost completely blocked by liquid. If the system does not contain enough liquid, the



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 86

reservoir empties before the condenser is completely blocked by liquid.

On the other hand, if the system contains too much liquid and the reservoir cannot

accommodate the full range of liquid change in the condenser, the CPL will work in the

fixed conductance mode and the temperature will not be controlled, (KU, 1994). As a

result, the amount of working fluid in the loop is a very important parameter for the proper

operation of CPLs. Most of the time, however, it is not trivial to find the ideal working

fluid charge ratio. Here, besides varying the working fluid charge ratio, it was also required

to change the set point temperature of the reservoir for the proper start up of the CPL.

Figure 4.12 shows the start up for three set point temperatures of the reservoir (40, 50

and 60 oC), for 120% working fluid charge ratio, heat load of 10W and CPL positioned

at horizontal position. The startup was not successful for set point temperatures of the

reservoir of 40 and 50 oC.

In Fig. 4.12(a) it is shown that after approximately 175 s the inlet condenser tem-

perature (Tcond,in) increases fast, indicating that the vapor front reached the condenser.

At 500 s, however, the evaporator temperature increases continuously, showing that the

system failed. A similar thermal behavior is shown in Fig. 4.12(b), where the system

failed at approximately 1700 s. The successful startup was reached for the set-point tem-

perature of the reservoir of 60 oC after a short excursion of the evaporator temperature,

as shown in Fig. 4.12(c).

The lower the set point temperature of the reservoir, the lower the saturation tem-

perature of evaporation into the capillary evaporator. Therefore, in order to have startup

at lower reservoir temperature, the working fluid charge ratio was increased to 130% and

the results are shown in Fig. 4.13 for heat load of 10 W and at horizontal position. Figure

4.13(a) shows that the CPL did not startup successfully for the set point temperature of

the reservoir of 40 oC. The system failed at approximately 1100 s. The successful startup

was reached for the set point temperature of the reservoir of 50 and 60 oC, Figs. 4.13(b)

and 4.14. Besides, in the case for the set point temperature of the reservoir of 50 oC, the

CPL only reached the successful startup under heat load equal or smaller than 10 W.

4.4.2 Temperatures of CPL as a Function of Heat Load

Figure 4.14 depicts the temperatures of the evaporator (Tevap), evaporator outlet

(Tevap,out), condenser inlet (Tcond,in), condenser outlet (Tcond,out), evaporator inlet (Tevap,in)

and the reservoir (Treservoir) at horizontal position with air cooling in the condenser. The

charge ratio was 130% and the set-point temperature of the reservoir was 60 oC. The

CPL had a sucessful startup and reached nearly the steady state for the range of heat

load from 5 to 30 W.

The temperature of the evaporator outlet for heat loads of 5 and 10 W remained

approximately constant and varied only 1oC. For heat loads higher than 10 W the tem-

perature of the evaporator outlet increased. It can be noticed that the temperatures of

the evaporator outlet and the condenser inlet are close for heat load up to 10 W. The

increased difference observed for higher loads is a consequence of axial heat transfer from

the heating surface of the evaporator to its outlet. The higher temperature at the evapo-

rator inlet is also a consequence of axial heat transfer along the tubbing from evaporator

surface.

The CPL (water) worked satisfactorily in the range from 5 to 30 W. The limit tem-

perature of 100 oC (assumed for safety reasons) at evaporator outlet was not reached even

for 30 W. However, considering the evaporator temperature as a limiting temperature,

the CPL worked properly up to heat load of 20 W.

position.

4.5 Comparision of the Results

Here, the results of the LHP and CPL are compared. Table 4.2 presents the time for

the startup corresponding to the results shown in Figs. 4.6, 4.12 and 4.13 for the LHP and

CPL, both using water, respectively. It is noticed that the times of startup for the CPL

were lower than for the LHP. To some extent, this difference between the times of startup

can be due to the differences between the evaporation areas in the capillary evaporator

of both systems. The evaporation area of the CPL (785.4 mm2) is two time greater than

the area of the LHP (392.7 mm2), and therefore the CPL can pump approximately twice

more liquid.

Figure 4.15 presents the temperatures of the evaporator outlet of the LHP using water

and acetone, the CPL using water, and the evaporator temperature of CPL using water

as a function of the heat load, at horizontal position for charge ratio of 130%. A large

difference between the outlet evaporator temperatures (Tevap,out) of the LHPs using water

and acetone, varing from 13 to 33 oC, is observed. The outlet evaporator temperature of

the LHP and the CPL (both with water) varied from 19 to 44 oC. It is clear from Fig.

4.15 that in the results of the CPL with water, there is a significant difference between

the temperature of evaporator (Tevap) and its outlet temperature (Tevap,out), varing from

14 to 66 oC. This difference occurs because the temperature sensor of the evaporator

(Tevap) was placed very close to the electric resistor (heating system). The existence

of this temperature difference indicates the presence of a large heat transfer along the

evaporator.

Figure 4.15 – Outlet evaporator temperature of the LHPs with acetone and water and
CPL with water, and evaporator temperature of the CPL with water for heat loads from
5 to 30 W at horizontal position, with 130% load.

In order to compare the results obtained for the LHPs and CPL, the total resistance

is calculated using Eq. 4.1. For the CPL, the temperature of the evaporator was used

instead of the outlet temperature of evaporator and the heat sink temperature is an

average temperature between the inlet and outlet of condenser. Figure 4.16(a) depicts

the total thermal resistance for the LHPs and CPL. It is noticed that the total thermal

resistances for the CPL, even using the evaporator temperature (Tevap - CPL), are lower



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 91

than LHP(water). According to the results presented in Fig. 4.16(a), the CPL with water

worked better than both LHPs for low heat load (5 W). The total thermal resistance was

larger for heat load of 5 W (5.6 oC/W for CPL using water, 8.2 oC/W for LHP using

water and 5.7 oC/W for LHP using acetone) and it reached the lowest values in the range

measured for heat load of 30 W (3.3 oC/W for CPL using water), heat load of 15 W (5.3

oC/W for LHP using water) and heat load of 20 W (2.9 oC/W for LHP using acetone).

The total thermal resistance (Rtotal) has been customary to express the quality of LHPs

and CPLs, however, it is noticed that Rtotal is size dependent, i.e., the Rtotal does not

take into account the area of evaporator where the heat transfer rate is applied. Thus, a

different figure of merit is proposed here,

R
??

total =
?T

q
?? , (4.2)

where q
??

is the heat flux dissipated by the two-phase system and ?T = TEvap ? THS is
the temperature difference between the hot surface, where the thermal load is applied,

and the heat sink.

It is noticed in Fig. 4.16(b) that R
??

total of the CPL (water) is larger than both LHPs.

The R
??

total was larger for heat flux of 0.53 W/cm
2 (52.8 oC/W/cm2 for CPL using water)

and heat flux of 1.06 W/cm2 (38.8 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using water and 27.0 oC/W/cm2

for LHP using acetone) and it reached the lowest values measured for heat flux of 3.18

W/cm2 (31.7 oC/W/cm2 for CPL and 25.0 oC/W/cm2 for LHP, both using water) and

heat flux of 4.24 W/cm2 (13.5 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using acetone). Now, according to the

results obtained with R
??

total, the LHP (acetone) worked better than the CPL and LHP,

both using water.

Figures 4.17 and 4.18 present a comparison between the results of the present work

and the results reported in the literature for Rtotal and R
??

total. Figure 4.17 shows the

results regarding the CPLs and Fig. 4.18 shows the results regarding the LHPs. It is

noticed in Fig. 4.17(a), regarding the Rtotal, that the CPL (water) worked only better

than the results reported by Wang et al. (2008) and Camargo (2004) for ceramic wick.

On the other hand, in Fig. 4.17(b), regarding the R
??

total which takes into account the

heat flux instead of the heat transfer rate, the CPL (water) worked better than all CPLs.

The result reported by Camargo (2004) for ceramic wick regarding the R
??

total is not shown

because its value reached 406.4 oC/W/cm2 and it is out of the scale of the graphic.

It is noticed in Fig. 4.18(a) and (b), regarding the Rtotal and R
??

total, despite the LHPs

developed here did not work as well as the mini-LHPs, they presented good results. One

reason for this relatively poor result is that the mini-LHPs reported by the other authors

use ammonia as working fluid which, due to its thermal properties, is considered the best

working fluid for capillary pumping systems.

4.6 Capillary Limit Analysis of the LHPs and the

CPL

The main operational limits of capillary pumping systems (CPL and LHP) are the

boiling and capillary limits. In this section, the capillary limit will be explored basing the

analysis on the experimental results. As explained before, the condition for both CPL and

LHP work is that the total system pressure drop does not exceed the maximum pressure

that the porous wick can provide. Due to the vapor penetration through the porous wick,

the operating temperature of the system has a sudden increase when the capillary limit

is exceeded. So, the capillary pumping system operation requires that the sum of the

pressure drops in the components and in the transport lines must be smaller than the

maximum capillary pressure head developed by the wick, i.e.,

?pcap,max ? ?pevap + ?pcond + ?pv + ?pl + ?pg (4.3)

In the following, the total pressure drop will be estimated based on the measurements

and compared to the expected maximum capillary limit.

4.6.1 Mass Flow Rate

The mass flow rate can be approximately obtained from the energy balance in the

compensation chamber and capillary evaporator assembly during steady-state operation.

During typical LHP operation, according to Fig. 4.19, heat is applied uniformly to the

evaporator (Qapp). The majority of the overall applied heat load (Qevap) vaporizes the

liquid on the outer surface of the porous wick and superheats the vapor in the vapor

channel up to the outlet of the evaporator. The other part of the applied heat load is

transferred through the metallic structure of the assembly to the compensation chamber,

where one part is transferred to the ambient (Qcc,amb), and the other part is transferred

to the vapor transport line.

Here, the heat transfer to the vapor transport line will be neglected. Thus, the energy

balance in the compensation chamber and evaporator requires:

Qapp = Qevap + Qcc,amb, (4.4)

where

and ?Tsubcooled is the liquid temperature difference between the condenser outlet and

compensation chamber inlet.

The heat transfer from the compensation chamber surface to the ambient, Qcc,amb =

hcc,ambAcc,out(T

coefficient by convection (hcc,amb) of a horizontal cylinder to the ambient can be estimated

from (INCROPERA; DEWITT, 2003),

hcc,amb =

where dcc,out is the outer diameter of the compensation chamber, ?air is the air thermal

?air is the thermal diffusivity and ?air is the kinematic viscosity of the air and Tf is the

film temperature. All properties of the air were evaluated at the film temperature (Tf ).

The effects of the sensible heat in the mass flow rate are only secondary in most cases

and can be neglected (

). From

the applied heat (Qapp), the mass flow rate can be estimated from,

Qapp =

m hlv + hcc,ambAcc,out(Tcc ?Tamb) (4.9)

where Tcc is the temperature measured at the wall of the compensation chamber, Tamb is

the ambient temperature measured and Acc,out is the external area of the compensation

chamber.

Since the reservoir in CPL is separated from the evaporator and assuming that there is

no heat transfer from the evaporator to the ambient (due to insulation of the evaporator),

the mass flow rate can be estimated from Qapp =
.
m hlv.

4.6.2 Fluid Properties

The fluid properties used in this work were obtained from the software Engineering

Equation Solver (EES) and Peterson (1994). These properties include saturation pressure,

latent heat, liquid and vapor densities, liquid and vapor viscosities, liquid and vapor

thermal conductivities, liquid and vapor specific heats and liquid surface tension. Further

information regarding the fluid properties, used in the present model for the estimation of

the pressure drop of the capillary pumping systems under study, can be found in Appendix

D.

4.6.3 Single-Phase Pressure Drop

Single-phase flow is assumed to prevail along the grooves, vapor and liquid trans-

port lines, liquid feeding channel and through the porous wick. The single-phase viscous

pressure drop can be estimated from the Darcy-Weisbach equation,

?p = f

(4.10)

where f is the Darcy (or Moody) friction factor. For laminar flow in circular tubes,

fRe = 64. For turbulent flow in smooth tubes, the solution proposed by H. Blasius,

f = 0.316Re?0.25 for 4000 &amp;lt;Re &amp;lt;105, is used.

The flow in the grooves can be shown to be laminar. The friction factor is given by

fRe = constant, where the Reynolds number is defined in terms of the hydraulic diameter

given by

dh =
2hgroovewgroove

(hgroove + wgroove)
(4.11)

where hgroove and wgroove are the height and width of the grooves, respectively. For the

grooves of the evaporator of interest, hgroove = 1 mm and wgroove = 1 mm, and therefore,

fRe = 57 (INCROPERA; DEWITT, 2003).

4.6.4 Condenser of LHP

In general, the condensers of CPLs and LHPs present superheated vapor, two-phase

and subcooled liquid regions which depend on the heat load. According to Ku (1994, 1999)

and Maydanik (2005), when the heat load is low (less than ? 50 W for their LHPs), the
vapor enters the condenser in saturate state and only a small area is necessary to occur the

phase change of the working fluid. Thus, for low heat load, the condenser presents only

two regions: two-phase and subcooled liquid. As the heat load of experiments presented

here (LHPs and CPL) are low, the temperature measured at the wall of condenser inlet

was assumed as the temperature of the vapor in saturated state that enters the condenser



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 99

of the LHPs, since the pressure of the LHPs was not measured. On the other hand, the

pressure of the CPL was measured and this assumption was not needed. This assumption

used for the LHPs is discussed in detail in Appendix D.

Figure 4.20 shows schematically the condenser with finned tube of the LHPs. The

three regions mentioned before are presented, but here the region of superheated vapor

is neglected due to the low heat load supplied to the LHPs. So, the length of condenser

can be divided in: Lcond = Lcond,l + Lcond,lv.

Figure 4.20 – Schematic diagram of the condenser for the LHPs with finned tube.

The lenght of two-phase (Lcond,lv) and liquid (Lcond,l) regions must be determined in

order to estimate the pressure drop along the condenser. First, an energy balance is

applied in the two-phase region of the condenser, schematically shown in Fig. 4.20.

The energy balance in the two-phase region provides:

There are several available correlations to estimate the two-phase heat transfer coef-

ficient (hcond,lv). Here, the correlation proposed by Cavallini and Zecchin (KAKAC; LIU,

2002) is used to determine the two-phase heat transfer coefficient,

The value of the Reeq varies along the condenser due to the variations in the vapor

fraction (x). In order to arrive at an averaged heat transfer coeficient along the two-phase

region (h?cond,lv), a model for the variation of x along the condenser is needed. Here, it will

be assumed that the fluid pressure remains approximately constant along the two-phase

region such that the ?T for heat transfer is constant and the rate of condensation also

remains constant. Therefore, it will be imposed that,

x = 1 ?

After the determination of the two phase length in the condenser, the liquid length is

determined as Lcond = Lcond,lv + Lcond,l.

The two-phase pressure drop consists of gravitational pressure drop, frictional pressure

drop, and acceleration pressure drop. Since the condenser is placed horizontally, the

gravitational pressure drop in the condenser is identically zero. The pressure drop of the

two-phase zone in the condenser is estimated using

4.6.5 Condenser of CPL

Two finned air coolers were used to cool the condenser section of the CPL. In this type

of coolers, the fan is mounted on top of the fin assembly and pushes air over the fin spacing.

There is very little information that can be used to estimate the heat transfer coefficient

for this situation. Therefore, here it is assumed that the air flow passes through the fins

as shown in Fig. 4.21. This assumption can overestimate or subestimate the value of the

heat transfer coefficient, thus, an evaluation of this estimation of heat transfer coefficient

is presented in Appendix D.

The lenght of two-phase (Lcond,lv) and liquid (Lcond,l) regions must be determined in

order to estimate the pressure drop along the condenser as in the previous section.

The two-phase heat transfer coefficient (hcond,lv) was estimated using the same equa-

tions introduced in the previous section (Condenser of LHP).

4.6.6 Results

The pressure drop of the capillary pumping systems here under study (two LHPs and

one CPL) were evaluated for the maximum heat load applied to the system (15 W for the

LHP (water), 25 W for the LHP (acetone) and 30 W for the CPL). The thermodynamic

properties of the working fluid were determined at the saturation temperature of the vapor

within the condenser. For the CPL, the saturation temperature was estimated using the

measured pressure at the system. However, for the LHPs, since the pressure was not

measured, the temperature of the condenser inlet (Tcond,in) was assumed as the saturation

temperature. Further explanations regarding this assumption can be found in Appendix



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 107

D. The Table 4.4 summarizes the estimated results, taking into account the dimensions

for both LHPs and the CPL tested in the lab. Further results are presented in Appendix

D.

).

Note in Table 4.4 that the total pressure drop (?ptotal) of all systems is smaller than

the capillary limit. It is noticed that the contribution of the pressure drop in the vapor

and liquid transport lines and in the two phase zone of condenser are much smaller than

the pressure drop in the porous wick. The total pressure drop of the CPL (water) is

greater than the LHP (water) due to the greater mass flow rate and the greater number

of grooves in the evaporator of the CPL. It can also be noticed the total pressure drop

of all capillary pumping systems is up to 57.4% of the capillary limit, showing that,

considering this limit, all capillary pumping systems are capable of transfering heat over

longer distances.

According to Ku (1994, 1999), Maydanik (2005) and others, the pressure drop across

the two phase zone in the condenser can be neglected when compared with the total

pressure drop of the capillary pumping systems. As it can be noticed in Table 4.4, the

two phase pressure drop in the condenser is very small representing less than 0.5%, due

to the low mass flow rates. Therefore, uncertainties in the evaluation of this contribution

are not very relevant.

4.7 Comparison Between the Experimental and The-

oretical Results

This section presents a comparison between the experimental and theoretical results

obtained with the model presented in Chapter 2. The curves of the critical nondimensional



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 108

average radius at z? = 1.0 and r? = 0.0 as a function of the nondimensional inlet heat

flux for two porous wick with one-layer and two layers are compared to the experimental

nondimensional average radius for each heat flux applied to the capilary pumping systems

tested in this work. Figure 4.22 presents this comparison.

The experimental nondimensional average radius was estimated for average pore ra-

dius of 3 µm and permeability of 1.5 × 10?14 m2. The input heat fluxes (qin) for each
capillary pumping system tested here were estimated as,

qin =
Qapp

NfinAfin
,

where Qapp is the heat transfer rate applied to the capillary evaporator, Nfin is the number

of fins in the capillary evaporator and Afin is the area of one fin.

The input heat fluxes (qin) for the experiments varied from 5.3 × 103 to 53.1 × 103

W/m2 and they are related to the heat loads from 5 to 15 W for the LHP (water), heat

loads from 5 to 25 W for the LHP (acetone) and heat loads from 5 to 30 W for the CPL

(water). The nondimensional input heat fluxes (q?in) varied from 1.3 to 13.3.

Figure 4.22 – Comparison between the experimental and theoretical results.

It is noticed in Fig. 4.22 that only the results of the LHP (acetone) reached the

capillary limit for a porous wick with one-layer. Despite the LHP (acetone) has reached

the capillary limit, it continued working for heat loads of 20 and 25 W. So, according



4 Experimental Results and Analysis 109

to the model (presented in Chapter 2), the evaporation front invaded the porous wick

and stablished a stable position within it. However, this comparison should be taken

only as a first approximation since the theoretical model does not reproduce completely

the geometry of the tested CPL and LHPs. Nevertheless, the physical trends remain the

same.

It is also noticed in Fig. 4.22 that, if a porous wick with two-layers with different

thermal conductivity was used, the capillary limit would increase, showing that the high

thermal conductivity underneath the fin are desirable for capillary pumping systems.

5 Conclusions and
Recommendations for Future
Work

In this last chapter, the general conclusions obtained in this thesis as well as proposals

for development of future works in modeling and design of LHP and CPL are presented.

5.1 General Conclusions

This study presents a theoretical and experimental study of two LHPs and one CPL.

Regarding the modeling of the heat and mass transfer problem in capillary evaporators,

a criterion for wick dry-out was proposed. Regarding the development of capillary evap-

orators of LHP and CPL, a new ceramic porous wick is proposed as an alternative to

wicks made of metal and plastic. These evaporators produced showed reliable operations

for LHP and CPL applications.

5.2 Modeling Conclusions

In Chapter 2, two models for the heat and mass transfer problem within the porous

wick of flat capillary evaporators are presented. First, a simplified model allowed ana-

lytical solutions for the velocity and temperature fields within the porous wick of a flat

capillary evaporator. The analytical solution by separation of variables was possible after

simpler boundary conditions are applied and this model was based on the model reported

by Cao &amp;amp; Faghri (1994a). Then, an improved model followed by its numerical solution is

presented. The improved model allowed to simulate the heat and mass transfer within a

wick with two layers with different thermophysical properties and to verify the effect of

design variables, dimensions, permeability, average pore radius and thermal conductivity

of the wick in the performance of the flat capillary evaporator. Furthermore, the improved

model also allowed to test the onset of drying underneath the fin, defining the limit for

the application of the model which considers the wick fully saturated with liquid.



5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 111

5.2.1 Simplified Model

With the simplified model, it was possible to analyze different types of porous wicks,

working fluids and the variation of some geometric parameters. This analysis provided

important information such as: the decrease of the wick thickness increased the capillary

limit, however increased both the temperature in the area close to the fin and the heat

flux to the feeding liquid channel. Also, as expected, it was noticed that the smaller

the thermal conductivity of the porous wick, the greater the temperatures in the area

underneath the fin. Therefore, the main conclusions from the variation of the parameters,

thickness and thermal conductivity obtained in the simplified model indicate that a good

design must seek:

1. an optimum thickness and a high permeability so that the heat flux to the feeding

liquid channel is minimized and the pressure losses remain low;

2. a porous material with optimum thermal conductivity so that the temperature in

the area underneath the fin is minimized, at the same time that the temperature

in the surface of the liquid channel is also limited. This contraditory need was also

observed by Figus et al. (1999) that recomended the use of a double layered porous

wick.

The analysis of the simplified model also revealed that the boundary conditions should

be improved to match better with the expected physics of the problem. This model also

allows no conclusions regarding the attainment of a capillary limit. Thus, it was verified

that:

1. the outlet velocity field is not uniform but it must result in higher velocities closer

to the fin;

2. the liquid channel surface temperature must be smaller than the vapor temperature.

5.2.2 Improved Model

With the improved model, it was possible to simulate the heat and mass transfer

within the porous wick with more than one layer with different thermophysical properties.

This improved model also provided a condition for dryout. The analysis of the porous

wick with one and two layers showed that the wick with two layers is better than with

one layer regarding the onset of drying underneath the fin. Other conclusions are:



5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 112

1. The capillary limit, or onset drying, stablishes a relation between the pore size (and

all medium properties) and the heat flux. If this limit is reached, the evaporation

front may penetrate within the porous wick. This can be used as a criterium for the

specification of the maximum heat flux allowed during operation in steady-state.

2. The larger the thermal conductivity of the porous wick 1 (underneath the fin), the

smaller is the heat transfer to the liquid feeding channel, causing a smaller increase

of the inlet temperature. The increase of the thermal conductivity of the porous

wick 1 causes the increase of the capillary limit, avoiding the onset of drying of the

region underneath the fin. The increase of the thermal conductivity also decreases

the mass flow rate, causing the decrease of the pressure losses through the porous

wick.

3. Finally, the dimensions of the bi-layered wick (R = 15 mm, R
?

= 7.5 mm, Lz,1 = 4

mm, Lz,2 = 6 mm) and its thermophysical properties can be used for a design of a

flat capillary evaporator.

5.3 Experimental Results and Conclusion

Most LHPs and CPLs use polyethylene or metallic porous wicks and the application

of ceramic porous wicks into the evaporators of capillary pumping systems is scarce. The

ceramic wick proposed here proved to be a reliable alternative for its applications in

LHPs and CPLs. Performance tests of two LHPs using acetone and water as working

fluids were carried out for power inputs up to 25 W, taking into account the steady state

condition, the changes in the heat sink temperature and also different slopes in relation

to the horizontal position of the LHPs. Performance tests of one CPL using water were

also carried out for power inputs up to 30 W.

The LHP with acetone and water worked satisfactorily in the ranges from 5 to 25

W and from 5 to 15 W, respectively. Considering the limit temperature of 100 oC, the

maximum power inputs were 25 W for acetone and 15 W for water. In spite of the LHPs

have worked satisfactorily, a high temperature difference between the evaporator outlet

and the heat sink was measured, varying from 40 to 80 oC for water and from 30 to 78

oC for acetone. The use of acetone as a working fluid ensured better results as compared

with water.

The CPL (water) worked satisfactorily in the range from 5 to 30 W. The limit tem-

perature of 100 oC (assumed for safety reasons) was not reached at the outlet evaporator

(Tevap.out) even for 30 W power input.



5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 113

The total thermal resistance was maximum for a heat load of 5 W (8.2 oC/W for

LHP using water and 5.7 oC/W for LHP using acetone) and it was minimum for a heat

load of 20 W (2.9 oC/W for LHP using acetone). The operation with water resulted in a

minimum total thermal resistance of 5.3 oC/W for a heat load of 15 W. The smaller the

total thermal resistance, the greater the heat transfer between the hot (evaporator surface)

and cold (heat sink) sources of the capillary pumping systems for a given temperature

difference.

Despite the quality of LHPs and CPLs has been customarily expressed by the total

thermal resistance (Rtotal), the results obtained with R
??

total showed more reliable for com-

parison of different systems. The results obtained with R
??

total for the CPL (water) were

larger than the both LHPs, i.e., the LHPs worked better than the CPL (water). The

R
??

total was larger for heat flux of 0.53 W/cm
2 (52.8 oC/W/cm2 for CPL using water) and

heat flux of 1.06 W/cm2 (38.8 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using water and 27.0 oC/W/cm2 for

LHP using acetone) and it reached the lowest values in the range measured for heat flux

of 3.18 W/cm2 (31.7 oC/W/cm2 for CPL and 25.0 oC/W/cm2 for LHP, both using water)

and heat flux of 5.3 W/cm2 (14.7 oC/W/cm2 for LHP using acetone).

Comparing the results of the present work with the results reported in the literature

regarding the R
??

total, the CPL (water) worked better than all CPLs reported in the lit-

erature reviewed in this work. On the other hand, despite the LHPs did not work as

well as the mini-LHPs, they presented satisfactory results. One possible reason for this

relatively poor result is that the mini-LHPs reported by the other authors used ammnonia

as working fluid which, due to its thermal properties, is considered the best working fluid

for capillary pumping systems.

The total pressure drop of all systems were estimated and no systems reached the

capillary limit. It was noticed that the contribution of the pressure drop in the vapor and

liquid transport lines and in the two phase zone of condenser were much smaller than the

pressure drop in the porous wick. Besides, the total pressure drop of the CPL (water) was

greater than the LHP (water) due to the greater mass flow rate and the greater number

of grooves in the evaporator of the CPL. As it could be noticed in the results, the two

phase pressure drop in the condenser was very small representing less than 0.5%, due to

the low mass flow rates. Therefore, uncertainties in the evaluation of this contribution

were not very relevant.

The experimental results were compared with the theoretical results obtained with the

model. Only the results of the LHP (acetone) reached the capillary limit for a porous wick

with one-layer. Despite the LHP (acetone) has reached the capillary limit, it continued

working for heat loads of 20 and 25 W. So, according to the model (presented in Chapter



5 Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Work 114

2), the evaporation front invaded the porous wick and stablished a stable position within

it. However, this comparison should be taken only as a first approximation since the

theoretical model does not reproduce completely the geometry of the tested CPL and

LHPs. Nevertheless, the physical trends remain the same. If a porous wick with two-

layers with different thermal conductivity was used instead of a porous wick with one-layer,

it was observed that the higher the thermal conductivity underneath the fin the higher

the capillary limit.

Finally, further research is still required in order to reduce the operation temperature,

evaluating changes related to the properties of the ceramic wick (porosity, pore size and

thermal conductivity) and improvements in the whole design of LHPs and CPL.

5.4 Future Works

This study initiated the research at LabCET (Laboratory of Combustion and Thermal

Systems Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil) and IKE (Institute of

Nuclear Technology and Energy Systems, Stuttgart University in Germany) regarding the

feasibility of the ceramic wick application in LHP and CPL using water as working fluid.

The main objectives of this work, the application of a ceramic wick in capillary pumping

systems (LHPs and CPLs) and the mathematical model which allow to determine the

vapor invasion threshold of the porous wick, were attained, however future research is

need. In the author’s opinion, the following research directions can be investigated in the

future:

? Adaptation of the model for the actual cylindrical geometry of the capillary evapo-

rators tested here.

? Design mini-LHPs and mini-CPLs in order to apply them in notebooks and desktops.

? Design and manufacture a LHP and/or CPL with devices to measure pressure drops

along the system and temperature distribution inside the capillary evaporator.

? Test the LHP and the CPL in microgravity environment for space application.

? Manufacture a ceramic wick with higher thermal conductivity, changing for instance

the percentage of mullite from 80 to 20% and alumina from 20 to 80%.

APPENDIX A

Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and

Mass Conservation

This appendix presents the volume averaged equations of energy and mass conserva-

tion used in the formulation of the model presented in Chapter 2. For the modeling, the

porous wick is a flat circular disc and is assembled between the liquid feeding channel and

the vapor chamber. Figure A.1 presents a rendering of the porous wick modeled. The

upper part of the wick is heated by an external heat flux. The evaporation process that

takes place in the wick of the capillary evaporator depends on the applied thermal load on

the system and it is assumed that it may occur in three regimes: microfilm evaporation,

evaporation at the external surface of the wick and evaporation within the wick.

Figure A.1 – Cross-section view of the flat capillary evaporator with cylindrical geometry.

Figure A.2 presents a unit cell formed by a half of a single fin and the region of the

porous wick bounded by the two symmetry surfaces. In Fig. A.2(a), an external heat

flux is supplied to the capillary evaporator and a liquid microfilm is formed between the

external surface of the porous wick and the vapor grooves as modeled by Demidov &amp;amp;

Yatsenko (1994). Since the inner surface temperature of the fin is higher than the liquid

temperature, the liquid microfilm tends to dry out. After the microfilm dries out, the

evaporation interface migrates to the external surface of the porous wick, as depicted in



Appendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 121

Fig. A.2(b). If the thermal load continues increasing, a capillary pressure threshold is

reached and the evaporation front moves to within the porous wick, as shown in Fig.

A.2(c). Here, only the evaporation regime in the external surface of the wick is studied.

Following Li &amp;amp; Ochterbeck (1999), this is the safest operation condition.

evaporation within the porous wick.

A.1 Local Problem

Assuming the existence of a liquid-vapor interface, according to Fig. A.3, in which the

mass flow rate of liquid, that flows by capillary action through the porous wick, becomes

vapor and flows via the grooves forward the condenser. This interface is composed by

several menisci.

Figure A.3 – The local problem of phase change within porous wick of a capillary pumping
system. Rendering of the surface of the porous wick during evaporation.

Since in this work the attention is focused on the evaporation of the liquid in the

upper surface of the porous wick, the porous medium is sutarated with liquid and the

evaporation only takes place in the boundary of the domain. The phase solid of the

porous wick is inert and impermeable to the fluid phases. The conservation equations



Appendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 122

that govern the phenomena are presented as follows. The mass conservation equation for

liquid phase:

? (?l)

?t
+ ?· (?lvl) = 0 (A.1)

The energy equation for the liquid and solid phases are:

? (?lcp,lTl)

?t
+ ?· (?lvlcp,lTl) = ??· ql (A.2)

? (?scp,sTs)

?t
= ??· qs (A.3)

The conduction heat fluxes in the solid and liquid phases are given by Fourier’s Law

as,

qs = ??s?Ts

ql = ??l?Tl

The momentum conservation equation (Navier-Stokes) for a compressible flow for the

liquid phase:

?l

(
?vl

+ vl ·?vl
)

= ??pl + µ?2vl + ?lf (A.4)

The boundary conditions for the interface solid-liquid may be represented as:

vl = 0 on Asl (A.5)

?l?Tl · n?ls = ?s?Ts · n?sl on Asl (A.6)

Tl = Ts on Asl (A.7)

The boundary conditions for the interface liquid-vapor in the upper surface of the

porous wick may be represented as:

?l (vl) · n?lv + ?v (vv) · n?vl = 0 on Alv (A.8)



Appendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 123

Tl = Tv on Alv (A.9)

pcap = pv ?pl on Alv (A.10)

The analysis of heat and mass transfer in porous wicks is a difficult task, because there

are limitations, even using modern computers, in the calculation of the detailed profiles of

the variables such as: temperature, pressure and velocities. There are two methods which

have been more used for solving the heat and mass transfer problem with phase change in

porous wick: volume averaging method (continuum approach) and pore network method.

Here, only the volume averaging method will be presented. Further information about

the application of pore network method for solving the heat and mass transfer problem

in porous wick can be found in Figus et al. (1999). The set of equations, presented above,

is solved using the volume averaging method.

A.2 Volume Averaging Method

The fields of temperature, pressure and velocities can be obtained with the macro-

scopic model using the volume averaging method. This method will be applied to the

govern equations of the heat and mass transfer phenomena in porous wick with phase

change, which takes place in the external surface of the porous wick. For the volume av-

eraging method, first it is necessary to choose a representative elementary volume (REV),

as shown in Fig. A.4. REV is the smallest differential volume that results in statistically

meaningful local average properties, i.e., a small increase in the REV does not change the

averaged properties. This requires that,

dp ? lREV ? Lwick

where dp is the pore characteristic diameter, lREV is the characteristic length of the REV

and Lwick is the largest characteristic length of the problem.

Some definitions and theorems are presented here to better understand the volume

averaging method. First, applying the volume average to the temperature of the solid

phase for example:

?Ts? =
1

V

?
V

TsdV (A.11)



Appendix A Volume Averaged Equations of Energy and Mass Conservation 124

Figure A.4 – Schematic averaging volume

Since Ts is defined only in the solid phase and is zero in all other phases, Eq. A.11

reduces to

?Ts? =
1

V

?
Vs

TsdV (A.12)

The disadvantage of the phase average is when the Ts is constant, because the phase

average value is not equal to this constant value of Ts. Then a quantity more representative

for the temperature of the solid is the intrinsic phase average, which is given by

?Ts?
s

?s + ?l = 1 (A.16)

The relation between the phase average and the intrinsic phase average is given by

The averaging theorem is an important tool in the formulation of volume averaged

equations and is given by

Applying the averaging theorem, defined in Eq. A.18, in Eq. A.20 and next substitu-

in volume average is obtained,

to the energy equation for the solid phase, we have:

?
? (?l)

?
+ ??· (?lvl)? = 0 (A.22)

Using the Reynolds transport theorem, defined in Eq. A.19, in the first term of Eq.

A.22 and the averaging theorem, defined in Eq. A.18, in the second term of of Eq. A.22,

then

A.5, which states that at a solid boundary the liquid velocity relative to the boundary is

zero, then the Eq. A.23 becomes,

? ??l?
?t

+ ?·??lvl? = 0 (A.24)

Applying the volume fraction for the liquid phase defined in Eq. A.15 and assuming

incompressible flow, we have the final form of the mass conservation equation for the

liquid phase in volume average:

??l
?t

+ ?·?vl? = 0 (A.25)

A.2.3 Energy Equation for the Liquid Phase in Volume Average

Now applaying the volume averaging method to the energy equation for liquid phase,

then the Eq. A.2 becomes:

?
? (?lcp,lTl)

?t

?
+ ??· (?lvlcp,lTl)? = ???· ql? (A.26)

Applying the Renolds transport and averaging theorems to the first and second terms

of the Eq. A.26, respectively, we have:

?lcp,lTlvl · nls dA = ???· ql? (A.27)

Again according to the boundary condition in the interface liquid-solid presented in

the Eq. A.5 (vl = 0), considering cp,l and ?l constant and using the averaging theorem in

the last term of the Eq. A.27, then

?lcp,l

Tl and vl in terms of the average values and deviations from these average values. Here,

it will be used the Gray’s decomposition as follows,

where Tl

A.2.4 Total Energy Equation in Volume Average

Whitaker (1977) states that in many processes the temperature of the liquid phase

is different from the temperature of the solid phase. However in drying processes, the

temperature of the liquid phase is equal to the solid one due to the relatively low convective

transport rates. Under these circumstances one is encouraged to assume that conductive

transport is sufficient to eliminate significant tamperature differences between the separate

phases. Then, in order to obtain the total energy equation in volume average for solid

and liquid phases, it is reasonable to assume the local thermal equilibrium between the

phases, i.e., the temperatures in each phase are equal (?Tl?
l
= ?Ts?

s
= ?T?). Now adding

the Eqs. A.21 and A.33, we have

According to Kaviany (1995) in the hipothesis of local thermal equilibrium it can also

A.2.5 Semiheuristic Momentum Equationin Volume Average

the macroscopic shear stress diffusion (Brinkman viscous term), the fourth represents the

microscopic viscous shear stress (Darcy term) and the fifth represents the microscopic

APPENDIX B

Verification Study of the Numerical Code

and Solution

This appendix presents a verification study of the numerical code and solution, which

was obtained with the model presented in Chapter 2. Grid refinement tests were performed

in order to evaluate the quality of the numerical code and solution. First, the numerical

code is analyzed using a methodology of manufactured solution, which was proposed by

Ec?a &amp;amp; Hoekstra (2008). Next, the numerical solution is analyzed using the Richardson

extrapolation in order to estimate the uncertainties of the numerical solution, which was

proposed by Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2002, 2005) and also implemented by Oliveira (2008).

B.1 Verification of the Numerical Code

The maturing of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes for pratical calculations

in engineering implies the need to stablish the credibility of the results by verification and

validation (Ec?A; HOEKSTRA, 2008). The verification of calculations is a purely mathemat-

ical exercise that intends to show that we are solving correctly the equations of the model.

On the other hand, the validation is a science and engineering activity that intends to

show that we are solving the right equations for the model. Here, only the verification is

presented.

According to Roache (1998), the verification of the calculations is composed of two

different processes: i) Code verification - verify that a given code solves correctly the

equations and that there are not any errors in the code or inconsistences in the algorithm

solution; and ii) Solution Verification - quantify the numerical erros in the computational

simulation.

The exact solution of the mathematical model or of a manufactured solution can be

used for the code verification. In the Method of Manufactured Solution (MMS), first a



Appendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 132

continuum solution is constructed. In general, this constructed solution will not satisfy the

governing equations (continuity and momentum) because of the arbitrary nature of the

choice. But by adding an appropriate source term, which removes any imbalance caused

by the choice of the continuum solution, the governing equations are forced to become

a model for the constructed solution. Further information about the MMS method can

be found in Ec?a &amp;amp; Hoekstra (2008, 2009). Here, the exact solution of the methamatical

model will be used for the code verification.

Two models were presented in Chapter 2: Simplified and Improved Models. It was

developed an exact solution for the simplified model and a numerical solution for the

improved model. A CFD code was developed in FORTRAN 90 for the numerical solution

of the improved model. In order to verify this CFD code, the boundary conditions of the

improved model were changed for the boundary conditions of the simplified model, which

was analytically solved. That is, the CFD code solved the simplified model numericaly for

six different grids. The monitoring of the errors was done using the Root Mean Squared

(RMS) error as,

RMS(e?) =

??Nr
i=1

?Nz
j=1

(
?Numi,j ??exact

)2
Nr × Nz

, (B.1)

where RMS(e?) is the RMS error of the variable ? (T - temperature or p - pressure), Nr

and Nz are the numbers of nodes of the grid in the r and z directions, respectively. i and

j are the nodes counters, ?Numi,j is the numerical solution for the node counter and ?exact

is the exact solution.

The RMS errors of the temperature RMS(eT ) and pressure RMS(ep) are presented

in Fig. B.1 for a grid refinement and heat flux of 4.0 × 104 W/m2.

Six grids were used and they are identified as (?50×50), (?100×100), (?150×150), (?200×200),

(?250×250) and (?300×300). In this notation, ?Nr×Nz represents a grid with Nr and Nz points.

Figure B.1 presents in the abscissa, a relative ratio between the six grids (?i) and the coarse

grid (?50×50). It can be noticed in both figures that the more refined the grid, the smaller

the RMS errors for both variables. It can also be noticed that the curves of RMS(eT ) and

RMS(ep) present an assymptotic behavior and the errors of the RMS(eT ) was 0.00054
oC

(0, 054%) and the RMS(ep) was 0.0140 Pa (1.40%) for a grid of ?150×150. Therefore, since

the RMS errors were estimated below 2% for both fields of temperature and pressure, the

grid (?150×150) was chosen.

B.2 Verification of the Numerical Solution

The analysis of the numerical solution was accomplished by the successive refinements

of the grids. Figures B.2 and B.3 present the grid refinements for the temperature and

pressure fields, respectively, at two locations in the computational domain (z = Lz and

z = Lz/2) and for the same heat flux of 4.0 × 104 W/m2. Five grids are shown and it
is noticed that the more refined the grid, the smaller becomes the difference between the

results. For instance, the differences among the results of the grids (?150×150), (?200×200)

and (?250×250) are almost indistinguishable.

A methodology for estimating the uncertainties of the numerical solution is applied as

follows. Oliveira (2008) presents in detail a methodology for estimating the uncertainties

of numerical solutions, which is based on the Richardson Error Estimator following Marchi

&amp;amp; Silva (2002, 2005). This methodology is briefly presented as follows. First, the area

averaged temperature and pressure are determined as,

T? =
1

? Lz
0

? r
0

T(r,z)rdrdz (B.2)

p? =
1

A

? Lz
0

? r
0

p(r,z)rdrdz. (B.3)

Next, seven grids, (?50×50), (?100×100), (?150×150), (?200×200), (?250×250), (?300×300) and

(?400×400) were used for calculating the average temperature and pressure. Tables B.1 and

B.2 present the average temperature and pressure, respectively, the grid refinement ratio

(?), the percentage of variation of the averaged values of T and p when compared to the

previous grid and the CPU time for each grid. These results were used in the calculation

of the numerical uncertainties.

Assuming that the possible mistakes made during the development of the CFD code

and the errors of iteration are small, the true discretization error E(?) of any variable

of interest (?) can be defined as the difference between the numerical (?num) and exact

(?exact) solutions,

E(?) = ?num ??exact (B.4)

In order to determine the true discretization error through Eq. B.4 requires knowing

the exact analytical solution (?exact). Unfortunately, in most practical problems, ?exact

is unknown. In such cases, the concept of estimated error or uncertainty U(?) of the

numerical solution can be expressed by,

U(?) = ?est ??num, (B.5)

where ?est is an estimated analytical solution and ?num is the numerical solution of any

variable of interest (?).

According to Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2005), among the estimators found in the literature for

estimating the discretization error, the generalized Richardson extrapolation is a good

choice. The estimated analytical solution (?est), using the generalized Richardson extrap-

olation, can be obtained by,

?est = ?1 +
?1 ??2
?? ? 1

, (B.6)

where ?1, ?1 and ?3 (it will be shown next) are the numerical solutions obtained, respec-

tively, with the fine, coarse and supercoarse grids, ? is the grid refinement ratio between

the grids and ? is the order of the discretization error.



Appendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 136

Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2005) classify the convergency order of the discretization error in:

?Theoretical (or real) order (?t) - its value depends on the extrapolation functions

used in the discretization of the mathematical model;

?Apparent order (?app) - its value is a function of the numerical solution obtained,

at least, with three different grids;

?Asymptotic order (?as) - value for which the apparent order (?app) converges when

the volumes of the grid tend to zero.

The apparent order (?app) can be calculated with the following equation for situations

where the grid refinement ratio (?) between three grids is either constant or variable.

?app =

ln

(
?2 ??3
?1 ??2

)
ln (?)

? (?3,2 = ?2,1 = ?) (B.7)

?app =

?

?app
2,1 ? 1

?
?app
3,2 ? 1

)]
ln (?2,1)

? (?3,2 6= ?2,1) (B.8)

Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2002) identify two types of behavior for ?app when the volumes of

the grid are decreased: subconvergent and superconvergent intervals as it is shown in Fig.

B.4.

(a) (b)

Figure B.4 – (a) Definition of the subconvergent interval and (b) superconvergent interval
of the apparent order. Source: adapted from Oliveira (2008).

Figure B.4(a) presents the subconvergent interval, in which as the volumes of the grid

are decreased in respect to a critical value (?rcritic), the values of the apparent order

(?app) are positive, increasing and lower than the value of the asymptotic order (?as). On



Appendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 137

the other hand, Fig. B.4(b) presents the superconvergent interval, in which the values

of the apparent order (?app) are positive, decreasing and greater than the value of the

asymptotic order (?as). For solutions of complex problems, ?app does not reach exactly

?as since for that it would be necessary an infinite number of control volumes.

If the apparent order (?app) is monotonic convergent, as it is presented in Figs. B.4(a)

and (b) within the dashed area, then the exact analytical solution (?exact) will be bound

between ?est(?as) and ?est(?app) and they can be estimated as,

?est (?as) = ?1 +
?1 ??2
??as ? 1

(B.9)

?est (?app) = ?1 +
?1 ??2

??app ? 1
(B.10)

According to Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2005), Eqs. B.9 and B.10 are the generalized Richardson

extrapolation. Replacing them in Eq. B.5, the uncertainty or estimated error of the

numerical solution for the apparent and asymptotic orders is obtained as,

URi (?as,?1) =
?1 ??2
??as ? 1

(B.11)

URi (?app,?1) =
?1 ??2

??app ? 1
, (B.12)

which represent the estimated errors of the numerical solution ?1 according to the Richard-

son error estimator (URi) (MARCHI; SILVA, 2005).

Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2005) demonstrate that the discretization error of a given numeri-

cal solution (?1) is bound between the values of URi(?as,?1) and URi(?app,?1) for the

subconvergent and superconvergent as follows,

URi (?as,?1)

E(?1)
? 1 ?

URi (?app,?1)

E(?1)
(B.13)

URi (?app,?1)

E(?1)
? 1 ?

URi (?as,?1)

E(?1)
(B.14)

The value of the uncertainty is considered reliable when the ratio between URi and E is

equal or greater than unit. Since the accuracy of the uncertainty depends on the difference

between ?app and ?as, the more the value of ?app approaches the value of ?as, the values

of
URi (?as,?1)

E(?1)
and

URi (?app,?1)

E(?1)
tend to unity and the estimate of the discretization



Appendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 138

error becomes more accurate (MARCHI; SILVA, 2005).

Since the equations of the numerical model for solving the energy and the momen-

tum problems were discretized using central discretization scheme (CDS), Marchi &amp;amp; Silva

(2005) suggest that the asymptotic order (?as) should be equal to 2.0. Table B.3 presents

the estimated variables for the calculation of the numerical uncertainties using the gen-

eralized Richardson extrapolation. It is noticed that as the grid is refined, the values

of the apparent order (?app) tend monotonically to the values of the asymptotic order

(?as = 2.0) in a subconvergent interval. So, the discretization error is within the interval

(URi (?as,?1) ? E(?1) ? URi (?app,?1)) when the ?app is within the subconvergent inter-
val. The upper limit of this interval is the numerical uncertainty obtained with the fine

grid (?1) of each group analyzed composed by three grids, which are presented in Tables

B.1 and B.2.

alized Richardson extrapolation.

Note: the values within parentheses ( ) refer to the pressure field presented in Table B.2.

Since that there are no analytical solutions for the temperature and pressure fields,

according to Oliveira (2008), the methodology proposed by Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2002) can be

used when the values of apparent order (?app) approach or, at least, tend to the values

of the asymptotic order (?as), that is, the estimate of the error is more accurate and the

ratio between estimated uncertainty and the real error tend to unit, making the estimate

more reliable.

In the lack of analytical solutions, the ratio
URi (?app,?1)

URi (?as,?1)
indentifies when the numer-

ical solution is accurate and reliable. From Table B.3, we can also notice that the values

of this ratio tend to unit as the grid is refined and that the values for the temperature

field are more accurate than those for pressure.

Figure B.5 presents a rendering of relative values of the variables used in the veri-

fication of the numerical solution, as explained above, for the subconvergent interval of

apparent order of error discretization.

Figure B.5 – Schematic diagram of the convergent solution ?C in the subconvergent in-
terval of ?app. Source: adapted from Oliveira (2008).

From this diagram, the convergent numerical solution can be expressed as,

?C =
|?est (?as) + ?est (?app)|

2
, (B.15)

where ?est(?as) and ?est(?app) are obtained from the Richardson extrapolation, Eqs. B.9

and B.10. For ?C, the numerical solution of the variable of interest (?) should be presented

or reported as (MARCHI; SILVA, 2005),

?1 = ?C ±UC (?C) . (B.16)

According to Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2005), the estimated error of ?C, UC (?C), is equal to

the modulus of half of the interval between ?est(?as) and ?est(?app), that is,

UC (?C) =
|?est (?as) ??est (?app)|

2
(B.17)

According to Marchi &amp;amp; Silva (2002, 2005), within the convergent interval of apparent

order (?app), it is advisable to use the convergent numerical solution (?C) instead of the

calculated numerical solution (?1), because the true discretization error of ?C, E(?C), is



Appendix B Verification Study of the Numerical Code and Solution 140

smaller than the true discretization error of ?1, E(?1). Table B.4 presents the estimated

numerical solutions for apparent and asymptotic orders, the convergent numerical solution

and the uncertainties of numerical solution by the convergent estimator.

Note: the values within parentheses ( ) refer to the pressure field presented in Table B.2.

From these results, it is noticed that the values of the numerical uncertainties decrease

slightly with the grid refinement. The uncertainties are lower than 0.5% for all groups of

grids. Now, if we look back in the CPU time column of Table B.1, we will notice that

the time difference for obtaining the numerical solutions between the grids (?150×150) and

(?400×400) is greater than 8h. That is, as the grids are refined, a significant increasing

of the CPU time is observed, although the uncertainties do not decrease significantly.

Therefore, the grid (?150×150) was chosen in order to decrease the CPU time for obtaining

the numerical solutions. For that grid, the numerical solutions for the temperature and

pressure fields are ?T = 38.41 ± 0.038 oC and ?p = 2285 ± 5.443 Pa, respectively.

APPENDIX C

Measurement Uncertainty Analysis

This appendix deals with the measurement uncertainty analysis regarding the ex-

pirements accomplished at LabCET/UFSC in Brazil and at IKE/Stuttgart University in

Germany. First is presented the theory for the measurement uncertainty analysis, which is

based on the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, ISO (2008). Next,

it is separately presented the assessing of uncertainties for the temperature and power

input measurements at both laboratories.

C.1 Theory of Assessing Uncertainty

Uncertainty exists in the measurements and the degree to which the uncertainty af-

fects the conclusion is an important issue. According to ISO (2008), the objective of a

measurement is to determine the value of the measurand, that is, the value of the par-

ticular quantity to be measured. A measurement, therefore, begins with an appropriate

specification of the measurand, the method of measurement and the measurement pro-

cedure. In general, the result of a measurement is only an approximation or estimate of

the value of the measurand and, thus, it will be complete only when accompanied by a

statement of the uncertainty of that estimate.

The simplest way of assessing uncertainty is to make many measurements and to use

the obtained results to estimate the range of possible values. Uncertainties estimated in

this way, using actual measurement and statistical analysis, are called Type A uncertain-

ties. On the other hand, when statistical sampling is impractical and the information

for the analysis is brought by physical theory, information from handbooks or varying

degrees of experience of similar situations, these uncertainties are called Type B uncer-

tainties. Here, both types of uncertainty are used.



Appendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 142

C.1.1 Standard Uncertainty

The standard uncertainty (u) of a source of uncertainties is defined as uncertainty

of the result of a measurement expressed as a standard deviation. The estimation of

standard uncertainty related to a source of uncertainties can be done through statistic

procedures or by others means.

There are several situations where the experimental standard deviation associated

to a source of uncertainties can be estimated from values of repeated observation of the

measurand. According to ISO (2008), uncertainties estimated in this way are called Type

A uncertainties.

Suppose that a random variable q represents the effects of a source of uncertainties

regarding the measurement result. The experimental standard deviation of this variable

q is determined from n values independently obtained for the variable q, i.e., qk (where

k = 1, 2, ...,n). So, the arithmetic mean of variable q can be expressed as:

q? =
1

n

n?
k=1

qk. (C.1)

The experimental standard deviation (s) of variable q is estimated as,

s (q) =

????? n?k=1 (qk ? q?)2
n? 1

(C.2)

This estimate of the experimental standard deviation s (q) characterizes the variability

of the observed values qk, or more specifically, their dispersion about their mean q?. If

only one measurement is done, the standard uncertainty is expressed by: u(q) = s(q).

However, if n measurements are done and their mean value is used for the calculation of

the measurement result, the standard uncertainty corresponds to the standard deviation

of the mean of the n measurements, i.e.,

u (q) = s (q?) =
s (q)
?
n

(C.3)

Type B uncertainties are those determined by other than statistical means. There are

several situations where it is not practical or possible to use estatistical procedures for

estimation of the experimental standard deviation related to a source of uncertainties. So,

according to Nicholas &amp;amp; White (2005), the evaluation of the uncertainties can be based

on theoretical models of the measurement, information from handbooks and data sheet,



Appendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 143

the work of other experiments, calibration certificates, even intution and experience.

According to ISO (2008), the proper use of available information for the Type B evalu-

ation of standard uncertainty calls for insight based on experience and general knowledge.

It should be recognized that the Type B evaluation of standard uncertainty can be as

reliable as the Type A evaluation, especially in a measurement situation where the Type

A evaluation is based on a comparatively small number of statistically independent ob-

servations.

If the error estimate is taken from a manufacturer’s specification, calibration certifi-

cate, handbook, or other source and its quoted uncertainty is stated to be a particular

multiple of a standard deviation, the standard uncertainty is simply the value of error

divided by the multiplier. According to ISO (2008), the normal probability distribution

is assumed for type A uncertainties and the multiplier is one (1). On the other hand, the

rectangular probability distribution is assumed for type B uncertainties and the multi-

plier is the square root of three (
?

3). Here in this work, it is made the same assumptions

as made by ISO (2008), i.e., normal probability distribution is assumed for type A and

rectangular probability distribution for type B.

C.1.2 Combined Standard Uncertainty

The variables of input quantities that contribute for the uncertainties can be corre-

lated or uncorrelated. The random variables are called statisticaly independent (or un-

correlated) when there is not any relation between the random increasing of one and the

random increasing (or decreasing) of another. On the other hand, the random variables

are called statisticaly interdependent (or correlated) when there is a noticable relation be-

tween the random increasing of one and the random increasing (or decreasing) of another

in a proportional way to the first one. Here, all contributing uncertainties are uncorrelated

(or independent) and the equations for estimation of that uncertainties are presented as

follows.

In most measurements there is more than one source of uncertainty. Assuming that a

determined measurand z is not measured directly, but is determined from independent (or

uncorrelated) random variables x, y and other variables through a functional relationship

f:

z = f(x,y, ...). (C.4)

The standard uncertainty of z, where z is the estimate of the measurand z and thus



Appendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 144

the result of the measurement, is obtained by appropriately combining the standard un-

certainties of the input estimates x, y and other variables of function f. The combined

standard uncertainty of the estimate z is denoted by uc(z) according to ISO (2008) and

it can be expressed by

uc (z) =

???? n?
i=1

(
?f

?x

)2
u2 (x) +

(
?f

?y

)2
u2 (y) + ..., (C.5)

where u(x), u(y) and other variables are the standard uncertainties of each source of

uncertainty.

C.1.3 Effective Number of Degrees of Freedom

The number of degrees of freedom is used in statistical distributions (e.g., in Student’s

t-distribution) to account the number of random uncorrelated variables used to calculate

the variance. In general, the degrees of freedom of an estimate (?) is equal to the number

of independent variables used to calculate the experimental standard deviation minus one,

i.e.,

? = n? 1. (C.6)

Equation C.6 should be used for the calculation of number of degrees of freedom

for type A uncertainties. On the other hand, for the type B uncertainties, in which is

assumed to have rectangular probability distribution, according to ISO (2008), the number

of degrees of freedom should be infinite.

According to Nicholas &amp;amp; White (2005), when the standard uncertainty of several

sources of uncertainties are considered to estimate the combined standard uncertainty, the

number of degrees of freedom resultant from the combined standard uncertainty should

be also estimated. This can be done by Welch-Satterthwaite equation,

u4c
?eff

=
u41
?1

+
u42
?2

+ ... +
u4p
?p
, (C.7)

where ?1, ?2, ..., ?p are the numbers of degrees of freedom and u1, u2, ..., up are the

standard uncertainties of each p sources of uncertainties.



Appendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 145

C.1.4 Expanded Uncertainty

According to ISO (2008), although the combined standard uncertainty (uc) can be

universally used to express the uncertainty of a measurement result, it is necessary to give

a measure of uncertainty that defines an interval concerning the measurement result that

may be expected to encompass a large fraction of the distribution of values that could

reasonably be attributed to the measurand. The additional measure of uncertainty that

meets the requirement of providing this interval is called expanded uncertainty (U).

In engineering applications is common to design within levels of confidence of 95%. For

that, the combined standard uncertainty (uc) should be multiplied by a coverage factor

k (Student coefficient) for obtaining the expanded uncertainty (U). According to ISO

(2008), this coverage factor is commonly represented by the symbol k95% for confidence

level of 95%. The expanded uncertainty (U95%) corresponds to a range of values that

encompass the uncertainty with confidence leval of about 95% and it is estimaded by:

U95% = k95%uc. (C.8)

C.2 Assessing Uncertainties of the Temperature Mea-

surements at IKE/Stuttgart University

In this work, all tests of LHPs were carried out at Institute of Nuclear Technology

and Energy Systems (IKE) of Stuttgart University in Germany. Here, it is presented

the assessing of uncertainties of these experiments for the temperature measurements.

Both types of uncertainties are evaluated here, e.g., the type A uncertainties which are

due to the repeatability errors of the temperature measurements (uRe) and the type B

uncertainties (obtained by catalogs and norms), which are due to the errors of the data

logger (uDL) and the temperature sensors (uPt100).

C.2.1 Type A Uncertainties

The type A uncertainties were evaluated due to the repeatability errors of the tem-

perature measurements. The temperatures along the LHP were measured for a steady

state condition for each step of heat load. n measurements of temperature were collected

in steps of time of 30 s during 20 min for each sensor and each step of heat load. Thus,

according to Eqs. C.1, C.2 and C.3, the uncertainty due to the repeatability errors (uRe)

can estimated as,

?
n
, (C.11)

where n is equal to 40 measurements, Tk are the n measurements of the measurand T and

T? is the arithmetic mean.

All temperature sensors used for the temperature measurements along the LHPs were

evaluated in order to estimate the uncertainty due to the repeatability errors, however

for simplifying reasons, only the greatest standard uncertainty among the temperature

sensors is presented in Table C.1.

C.2.2 Type B Uncertainties

The type B uncertainties (obtained by catalogs and norms) are due to the errors of

the data logger (uDL) and the temperature sensors (uPt100). The temperature distribution

along the LHP was measured using temperature sensors (RTDs) of type Pt100 delivered

with an accuracy of class A. Regarding to international norm IEC751 (1983), the error of

the RTDs can be estimated by following equation:

uPt100 = 0.15 + 0.002T, (C.12)

where T is the operation temperature of the Pt100, which range from ?100 to +450 oC.
Here, this error was evaluated for limiting operation temperature of 100 oC and the result

is presented in Table C.1.

The error of the temperature measurement for RTDs at the data logger(uDL) was

obtained in the accuracy specification of the catalog of the Agilent 34970A (Data Acqui-

sition/Switch Unitsare), which is estimated as 0.06 oC.

C.2.3 Combined Standard Uncertainty

The sources of uncertainties mentioned before - repeatablility, data logger and tem-

perature sensors - are composed by uncorrelated variables. So, the combined standard



Appendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 147

uncertainty for the temperature measurements, according to Eq. C.5, can be expressed

as,

uc (T) =

?(

?TRe

)2
u2Re (TRe) +

(

?TDL

)2
u2DL (TDL) +

(C.13)

where
?T

= 1 and Eq. C.13 becomes,

uc (T) =
?
u2Re (TRe) + u

2
DL (TDL) + u

2
Pt100 (TPt100). (C.14)

C.2.4 Expanded Uncertainty

For the estimation of the expanded uncertainty, it is necessary to determine the cover-

age factor (k) which is function of the confidence level and the effective number of degrees

of freedom (?eff ). It assumed the confidence level of 95% and the effective number of

degrees of freedom is estimated using the Eq. C.7. In ISO (2008), there is a Table with

the values of coverage factor (k) from a statistical distribution which is function of degrees

of freedom (?) for different levels of confidence. Usually when the effective number of de-

grees of freedom (?eff ) is great, the coverage factor (k95%) is equal to 2.0 for a confidence

level of 95%.

C.2.5 Results

Table C.1 presents the summary of standard uncertainty components for the tem-

perature measurement. It is noticed that the number of degrees of freedom is great

(?eff = 2.57×1011) and the k95% is equal to 2.0. Therefore, the expanded uncertainty for
the temperature measurement is estimated as ±0.41 oC.

The tests of the CPL were carried out at Laboratory of Combustion and Engineering

of Thermal Systems (LabCET) of Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil. Here, it

ments. It was accomplished the same procedure that was presented in previous section.

Both types of uncertainties are evaluated, however in the type A uncertainties is included

the uncertainty (uCal) due to the errors of thermocouples calibration for the temperature

measurements.

C.3.1 Type A Uncertainties

The type A uncertainties were evaluated due to the errors of repeatability (uRe) and

thermocouples calibration (uCal) for the temperature measurement. The temperatures

along the CPL were measured for a steady state condition for each step of heat load. n

measurements of temperature were collected in steps of time of 30 s during 20 min for

each sensor and each step of heat load. The uncertainty due to the repeatability errors

(uRe) was estimated using Eqs. C.1, C.2 and C.3. Again, all thermocouples used for

the temperature measurements along the CPL were evaluated, however for simplifying

reasons, only the greatest standard uncertainty among the thermocouples is presented in

Table C.2.

The thermocouples calibration was done using a reference thermometer which has

the operation range from ?10 to +100 oC and accuracy of 0.01 oC. The thermocouples
and the reference thermometer were imersed in a heat sink, which used water as working

fluid. The heat sink temperature was varied in a range from 10 to 80 oC in steps of 5

oC. The results of the temperature measurements with the thermocouples were compared

with the reference thermometer results. Finally, the experimental standard deviations

for each thermocouple was calculated. All thermocouples were evaluated based on the

experimental standard deviation, but only the greatest standard uncertainty (uCal) among

the errors of thermocouples calibration is presented in Table C.2.



Appendix C Measurement Uncertainty Analysis 149

C.3.2 Type B Uncertainties

The type B uncertainties (obtained only by catalogs) are due to the errors of the data

logger (uDL) and the termocouples (uThermocouple). The temperature distribution along

the CPL was measured using thermocouples type T and their errors are estimated as 1.0

oC according to Omega Engineering Inc. The error of the temperature measurement for

thermocouples at the data logger (uDL) was obtained in the accuracy specification of the

catalog of the Agilent 34970A (Data Acquisition/Switch Unitsare), which is estimated as

1.0 oC.

C.3.3 Combined Standard Uncertainty

The sources of uncertainties (repeatablility, calibration, data logger and thermocou-

ple) are composed by uncorrelated variables. So, the combined standard uncertainty for

the temperature was estimated using Eq. C.5.

C.3.4 Expanded Uncertainty

It was also assumed the confidence level of 95% for the estimation of the expanded

uncertainty.

C.3.5 Results

Table C.2 presents the summary of standard uncertainty components for the tem-

perature measurement. It is also noticed that the number of degrees of freedom is great

(?eff = 2.49 × 108) and the k95% is equal to 2.0. Therefore, the expanded uncertainty for
the temperature measurement is estimated as ±1.77 oC.

C.4 Assessing Uncertainties of the Power Input Mea-

surements at IKE/Stuttgart University

The electrical power input for the two cartridge heaters is controlled by the mea-

surement software via the data acquisition system, sending the target value to the power

supply units. Only the type B uncertainties were evaluated for the power suply and its

errors is estimated as 0.2% (by catalog) for the voltage of inputs and outputs. Each

cartridge heater provides 12.5 W for the maximum power input of 25 W (value obtained

with the LHP using acetone as working fluid). As each cartridge heater has an electrical

resistance of 7.76 ?, for the the maximum power input of 12.5 W, the voltage of each

cartridge is equal to 9.85 V. Thus, if the voltage error is 0.2% of the voltage of each

cartridge, it means that the voltage error for the input and output is 0.0197 V.

With a maximum power input of 25 W (value obtained with the LHP using acetone

as working fluid), i.e., 12.5 W for each cartridge heater. As each cartridge heater has an

electrical resistance of 7.76 ?, for the the maximum power input of 12.5 W, the voltage

of each cartridge is equal to 9.85 V. Thus, if the voltage error is 0.2%, it means that the

voltage error for the input and output is 0.0197 V.

The power input is a function of the electrical resistance and the voltage measured

in the power supply unit. Since there are two cartridge heaters, the total power input is

estimated as,

C.5 Assessing Uncertainties of the Power Input Mea-

surements at LabCET/UFSC

The electrical power input for the heating system of the CPL was controlled by the

direct measurement in the power supply unit (Agilent N6700B). The errors of the power

supply unit are given for the voltage as 0.1% + 100 mV and for the current as 0.15% + 6

mA. The power input is a function of the current (I) and the voltage (V ) measured in

the power supply unit and it is estimated as,

Qapp = V I, (C.17)

where Qapp is the power input, V is the voltage and I is the current.

The combined standard uncertainty for the power input is estimated using the Eq.

C.6 Assessing Uncertainties of the Pressure Measure-

ments at LabCET/UFSC

Here, it is presented the assessing of uncertainty of pressure measurements at the

CPL. It was accomplished the same procedure that was presented in previous sections.

Both types of uncertainties are evaluated.

C.6.1 Type A Uncertainties

The type A uncertainty was evaluated due to the errors of repeatability (uRe) for

the pressure measurement. The pressure at the liquid line of the CPL was measured

for a steady state condition for each step of heat load. n measurements of pressure were

collected in steps of time of 30 s during 20 min for each step of heat load. The uncertainty

due to the repeatability errors (uRe) was estimated using Eqs. C.1, C.2 and C.3. Here,

only the greatest standard uncertainty among each step of heat load is presented in Table

C.6.

C.6.2 Type B Uncertainties

The type B uncertainties (obtained only by catalog) are due to the errors of the

pressure transducer (uPressure). The pressure at the liquid line of the CPL was measured

using a steel transducer type PX309-030A5V and their errors are estimated as 2% of the

measurements according to Omega Engineering Inc.

C.6.3 Combined and Expanded Uncertainties

The sources of uncertainties (repeatablility and transducer) are composed by uncor-

related variables. So, the combined standard uncertainty for the pressure was estimated

using Eq. C.5. It was assumed the confidence level of 95% for the estimation of the

expanded uncertainty.

C.6.4 Results

Table C.6 presents the summary of standard uncertainty components for the pressure

measurement. It is also noticed that the number of degrees of freedom is great (?eff =

7.2×102) and the k95% is equal to 2.0. Thus, the expanded uncertainty for the temperature
measurement is estimated as ±345.22 Pa.

APPENDIX D

Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop

This appendix presents the reasons for the assumptions taken for the hydrodynamic

model presented in Chapter 4. The data input, the thermophysical properties and the

main results of the hydrodynamic model for each capillary pumping systems (Two LHPs

and one CPL) are also presented.

D.1 Introduction

The main operational limit of capillary pumping systems (CPL and LHP) are the

boiling and capillary limits. Here, the capillary limit will be explored basing the analysis

on the experimental results. The condition for both CPL and LHP work is that the total

system pressure drop does not exceed the maximum pressure that the porous wick can

provide. So, the capillary pumping system operation requires that the sum of the pressure

drops in the components and in the transport lines must be smaller than the maximum

capillary pressure head developed by the wick, i.e.,

?pcap,max ? ?pevap + ?pcond + ?pv + ?pl + ?pg

In order to estimate the total pressure drop of the LHPs and CPL, a hydrodynamic

model was developed based on the measurements and the results were compared to the

expected maximum capillary limit. The hydrodynamic model is composed by the set of

equations already presented in Chapter 4. For the LHPs, this set of equations is solved

according to the following steps:

(1) Input data such as the LHP dimensions, working fluid, Qapp, TCC, Tamb, TCond,in,

TCond,out, THS,in, THS,out and
.
mHS are supplied to the model.

(2) The thermophysical properties of the working fluid are estimated as a function of

the working fluid saturation temperature in the condenser. Next, the mass flow rate is



Appendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 156

calculated using Eqs. 4.1 to 4.9.

(3) The pressure drops in the porous wick - Eqs. 4.10 and 4.13 - and in the grooves -

Eqs. 4.10 and 4.11 - as well as in the vapor transport line, Eq. 4.10, are estimated.

(4) The condenser two-phase region lenght (Lcond,lv) is estimated using the Eqs. 4.14

to 4.33. Next, the length of liquid region (Lcond,l) is estimated subtracting the two-phase

length (Lcond,lv) from the total condenser length (Lcond).

(5) The pressure drop in the liquid transport line is estimated using Eq. 4.10.

(6) The condenser two-phase region pressure drop is estimated using Eqs. 4.34 to

4.40.

Considering now the CPL, the set of equations is solved as follows:

(1) Input data such as the CPL dimensions, Qapp, Tamb, PSensor, TCond,in and TCond,out

are supplied to the model.

(2) The working fluid thermophysical properties are estimated as a function of the

saturation temperature, which was calculated regarding the pressure measured with the

pressure sensor. Next, the mass flow rate is calculated by Qapp =
.
m hlv.

(3) The pressure drops in the porous wick, Eqs. 4.10 and 4.13, in the grooves, Eqs.

4.10 and 4.11, and in the vapor transport line, Eq. 4.10, are estimated.

(4) The condenser two-phase region lenght (Lcond,lv) is estimated using the Eqs. 4.41

to 4.53. Next, the length of liquid region (Lcond,l) is estimated subtracting the two-phase

length (Lcond,lv) from the total condenser length (Lcond).

(5) The pressure drop in the liquid transport line is estimated using Eq. 4.10.

(6) The condenser two-phase region pressure drop is estimated using Eqs. 4.34 to

4.40.

D.2 Saturation Temperature of the CPL and LHPs

From the previous section, one can notice that the saturation temperature is needed

in step (2) in order to estimate the working fluid thermophysical properties to be used in

both CPL and LHPs models. On the one hand, for the CPL model, the system pressure

was measured and its saturation temperature could be determined. On the other hand,

for the LHP model, it was not possible to determine the saturation temperature in the

condenser (or in any other component) based only on temperature measurements at LHP

walls. Thus, the working fluid saturation temperature was assumed as the temperature



Appendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 157

measured at the wall of the condenser inlet. The reasons for that assumption are presented

as follows.

The LHP startup occurs when the temperature measured at the condenser inlet in-

creases suddenly. Figure D.1, which was already presented in Chapter 4 and is repeated

here for didactical purposes, shows the steady state of LHP (using water as working fluid)

for an increasing heat load. As the heat load is applied, it is noticed that the evapora-

tor outlet temperature increases. After some seconds, the condenser inlet temperature

increases suddenly as well, showing that the LHP has started up. It should be observed

that the condenser inlet temperature presents an unstable behavior only for the 5 W heat

load, probably due to the formation and possible colapse of bubbles before the condenser

inlet. As the heat load increases to 10 W, that behavior disappears. To some extend, the

presence of this instability indicates that vapor enters the condenser at saturated state.

Figure D.1 – Temperatures of LHP (water) for heat loads increasing at horizontal position
and at heat sink temperature of 20 oC (Already presented in Chapter 4).

Figure D.2 presents the results for temperatures along the CPL and the pressure

measured at the liquid line for three different heat loads (Qapp = 10, 20 and 30 W). The

mean pressure was 8.22, 11.61 and 13.23 kPa for heat load of 10, 20 and 30 W, respectively.

Based on the results presented in the previous figure, the saturation temperature was

estimated as a function of the mean pressure. Figure D.3 presents this temperature, the

condenser inlet temperature and their correspondent uncertainties. The results show that

the temperatures are in the range of the uncertainty. Therefore, the assumption that

the saturation temperature becomes closer to the temperature measured at the condenser

position and with 130% load.

inlet does not involve great errors. It should be addressed that this assumption was taken

only for the LHPs.

Figure D.3 – Saturation temperature (as a function of the mean measured pressure),
condenser inlet temperature and their correspondent uncertainties.

For the CPL model, the saturation temperature in the condenser was estimated as a

function of the pressure measured. Since the pressure sensor is located at the liquid line,

the saturation temperature in the condenser is different from the saturation temperature

estimated as a function of the pressure. This difference was estimated using the Clausius-



Appendix D Hydrodynamic Model for Pressure Drop 159

Clapeyron equation, as follows,

(Tcond,sat ?Tsensor,sat) = ?p
Tsensor,satvlv

hlv
, (D.1)

where Tcond,sat is the condenser saturation temperature, Tsensor,sat is the saturation tem-

perature estimated as a function of the pressure measured with the sensor, ?p is the

pressure drop between the condenser inlet and the location of the pressure sensor at the

liquid line.

The results obtained with Eq. D.1 showed that the difference between the saturation

temperatures was less than 0.05% for the maximum heat load of 30 W.

D.3 Heat Transfer Coeffient of the Air Flow in the

Condenser of the CPL

Two finned air coolers were used to cool the condenser section of the CPL. In this

type of coolers, the fan is mounted on top of the fin assembly and pushes air over the fin

spacing. There is very little information that can be used to estimate the heat transfer

coefficient for this situation. Therefore, here it is assumed that the air flow passes through

the fins as shown in Fig. D.4.

Figure D.4 – Schematic diagram of the finned condenser for the CPL.

This assumption can overestimate or subestimate the value of the heat transfer co-

efficient. In order to evaluate its influence on the total pressure drop of the CPL, the

heat transfer coefficient of the air flow was varied. Table D.1 shows the results of the

two-phase length, two-phase region pressure drop and its percentage as well as the total

CPL pressure drop as a function of the air flow heat transfer coefficient.

Despite all the parameters decreased with the heat transfer coefficient increase, the

total CPL pressure drop decayment was relative small and the equations presented in

D.4 Data Inputs and Themophysical Properties

determined as a function of the saturation temperature in the condenser. The LHPs and

CPL dimensions were already presented in Tables 3.1 and 3.3 in Chapter 3, respectively.

Table D.8 presents the pressure drop of the capillary systems here under study for the

maximum heat load applied to the capillary systems, 15 W for the LHP (water), 25 W

for the LHP (acetone) and 30 W for the CPL. Note in Table D.8 that the total pressure

drop (?ptotal) of all systems is smaller than the capillary limit. It is noticed that the

contribution of the pressure drop in the vapor and liquid transport lines and in the two

phase zone of condenser are much smaller than the pressure drop in the porous wick. The

total pressure drop of the CPL (water) is greater than the LHP (water) due to the greater

mass flow rate and the greater number of grooves in the evaporator of the CPL. It can

also be noticed the total pressure drop of all capillary pumping systems is up to 57.4%

of the capillary limit, showing that, considering this limit, all capillary pumping systems

are capable of transfering heat over longer distances.
