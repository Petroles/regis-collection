REPRESENTATIVITY OF QUATERNARY MAMMALS FROM THE SOUTHERN 
BRAZILIAN CONTINENTAL SHELF

ABSTRACT –  Fossils of terrestrial mammals from the southern Brazilian continental shelf have been known since the 
late 19th century. The fossils are relatively common and represent several taxonomic groups of the Pleistocene megafauna. 
Although the systematics of the fossil assemblage is well known, the relative proportions among taxonomic groups and their 
skeletal elements have not been evaluated yet. Here are presented the results of a survey of the diversity of skeletal elements 
and taxa among 2,391 specimens belonging to the paleontological collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande 
(FURG). The survey revealed that the most common taxa are the artiodactyls, ground sloths, glyptodontids and toxodontids, 
while carnivores, rodents and litopterns are very scarce. The most abundant skeletal elements are osteoderms of cingulates 
(mostly glyptodontids) and teeth of other groups. Although paleoecological and paleoenvironmental inferences are very 
hard to obtain because the fossils do not have a stratigraphic setting, encompass a wide time span, of some 700 ky BP, and 
represent several environments and climates, some patterns of taxonomic abundance are apparently related to ecological 
factors, while others seem to result from taphonomic processess. 

Key words: megafauna, Pleistocene, Southern Brazil, continental shelf.

RESUMO –  Fósseis de mamíferos terrestres procedentes da plataforma continental do sul do Brasil são conhecidos desde o 
século 19. Esses fósseis são relativamente comuns e representam diversos grupos taxonômicos da megafauna do Pleistoceno. 
Embora a sistemática da assembleia fóssil seja bem conhecida, as proporções relativas entre os diferentes grupos e seus 
elementos esqueletais ainda não foram avaliadas. Aqui são apresentados os resultados de um levantamento da diversidade de 
elementos esqueletais e táxons entre 2.391 espécimes pertencentes à coleção paleontológica da Universidade Federal do Rio 
Grande (FURG). O levantamento revelou que os táxons mais comuns são artiodáctilos, preguiças terrícolas, gliptodontídeos 
e toxodontídeos, enquanto carnívoros, roedores e litopternos são bastante escassos. Os elementos esqueletais mais abundantes 
são osteodermos de cingulados com predominância de gliptodontídeos, e dentes de outros grupos. Embora seja difícil fazer 
inferências paleoecológicas e paleoambientais, devido ao fato de os fósseis não apresentarem contexto estratigráfico, 
representarem grande intervalo temporal da ordem de 700 ky BP e indicarem diferentes tipos de ambientes e climas, alguns 
padrões de abundância taxonômica parecem relacionados a fatores ecológicos, enquanto outros parecem ser resultados de 
processos tafonômicos.

INTRODUCTION

Fossils of terrestrial mammals have been collected 
from continental shelves all around the globe, such as the 
northeastern coast of North America (Whitmore et al., 1967) 
and the North Sea (Van Kolfschoten &amp;amp; Laban, 1995; Mol 
et al., 2006). Similar fossils have also been found on the 
Argentinean continental shelf, in front of the estuary of the 
La Plata River (Cione et al., 2005) and the coast of Buenos 
Aires Province (Tonni &amp;amp; Cione, 1999), and on the northeastern 
Uruguayan coast (Rinderknecht, 2006). In Brazil, fossils of 
terrestrial mammals preserved on the continental shelf have 

been recorded from the coast of Rio Grande do Sul State since 
the late 19th century, when German naturalist Hermann Von 
Ihering described in a letter to Argentinean naturalist Florentino 
Ameghino the presence of some osteoderms of glyptodonts on 
the beach (Ameghino, 1891). Recently, the presence of such 
remains in deeper areas of the shelf, collected by fishermen, has 
also been published (Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2010). The studies 
on such fossils have been aimed mostly at their taxonomic 
identification (e.g. Cunha, 1959; Paula Couto &amp;amp; Cunha, 1965; 
Oliveira, 1992, 1996; Rodrigues &amp;amp; Ferigolo, 2004; Rodrigues 
et al., 2004; Scherer, 2005; Marcon, 2007; Scherer et al., 2009). 
Other studies have focused on the distribution of such remains 



REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 15(1), 201258

along the coast (Buchmann, 1994), their taphonomy (Lopes et 
al., 2008) and ages (Lopes et al., 2010).

The fossils are found disarticulated, exhibiting signs of post 
mortem breakage and abrasion (Lopes et al., 2008). They come 
from large concentrations of marine and terrestrial skeletal 
remains on the inner continental shelf, at depths between 0 and 
20 m (Figueiredo, 1975; Buchmann, 2002). During autumn and 
winter, storm waves erode these concentrations and transport the 
fossils to the beach, where they are collected. Besides terrestrial 
mammals, the concentrations also contain remains of marine 
mollusks (Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2008), corals, echinoderms, 
crustaceans (Buchmann, 1994; Lopes, 2011), teleost (Richter, 
1987) and elasmobranch fishes (Buchmann &amp;amp; Rincón Filho, 
1997), pinnipeds (Oliveira &amp;amp; Drehmer, 1997), cetaceans (Cunha, 
1982; Ribeiro et al., 1998), seabirds (Lopes et al., 2006) and 
reptiles (Hsiou &amp;amp; Fortier, 2007; Hsiou, 2009).

The presence of terrestrial fossil mammals in a modern 
marine environment is attributed to the existence of Pleistocene 
continental fossiliferous deposits that were reworked by sea-
level oscillations. During the Quaternary glacial maxima, the 
ocean levels reached some 130 m below present-day levels, 
thus exposing large areas of the continental shelves all around 
the world that were occupied by terrestrial environments and 
were covered and reworked by sea level rises at the end of 
glaciations (Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2010). Recent ages obtained 
by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) on seven fossil teeth from 
the southern Brazilian continental shelf revealed that the fossils 
are between 650 ± 100 and 18 ± 3 ky BP, and represent several 

temporally distinct fossil assemblages (Lopes et al., 2010). The 
large age span, the co-occurrence of fossils that indicate arid 
and open environments such as Reithrodon Waterhouse, 1837 
and Dolichotinae rodents, and other records (Cunha, 1959; 
Rodrigues &amp;amp; Ferigolo, 2004) such as Tapirus Brunnich, 1772, 
Hydrochoerus Brisson, 1762 and Myocastor Kerr, 1792 that 
indicate permanently humid or forested environments, plus the 
lack of a precise stratigraphic context, difficult paleocommunity 
reconstructions based on fossils from the continental shelf.

Although the fossils are somewhat common and several 
mammalian groups are recognized from these deposits (Table 
1), until now there has been no detailed survey regarding 
the relative proportions among taxa, given that the available 
taxonomic studies are based on specific groups and isolated 
specimens. Here is presented a survey of the relative proportions 
of mammalian taxa and respective skeletal elements found on the 
southern Brazilian continental shelf. The present survey is aimed 
at improving the knowledge regarding such taxa and evaluating 
patterns that may have influenced taxonomic and anatomic 
representativity. Although representing distinct assemblages 
with different ages, mixed together by erosive processes related 
to sea-level oscillations, for the purposes of the present study all 
fossils are considered as a single assemblage.

Late Cretaceous, by accumulation of sediments eroded from 
the older, higher geomorphologic units (Figure 1). Between 
the Neogene and Quaternary the morphology of the CPRS was 
affected by glacioeustatic oscillations, which led to the formation 
of two major depositional systems: the Alluvial Fans System and 
the Pleistocene-Holocene Complex Multiple Barrier (Villwock 
&amp;amp; Tomazelli, 1995).

The latter unit is subdivided into four large barrier-lagoon 
depositional systems and associated features. Each barrier-
lagoon was formed by a marine transgression, correlated to late 
Pleistocene-Holocene interglacial episodes (Tomazelli et al., 
2000). The constituent sediments are essentially siliciclastic, 

well-sorted and mature sands, with small amounts of organic 
matter, biogenic carbonate, diagenetic clays and concentrations 
of heavy minerals (Villwock &amp;amp; Tomazelli, 1995).

The continental shelf, which constitutes the submerged 
portion of the CPRS, has a low slope (average ratio of 1:1.000) 
and the shelf break is located at depths between 80 and 120 
meters. The middle-central portion of the shelf is wide, 
morphologically reworked and presents paleofluvial channels 
and sand banks (Corrêa et al., 1996). During the Holocene 
transgression of 6-7 ky BP, variations in the rates of sea-level 
rise promoted the reworking and concentration of clastic 
terrigenous sediments and formed abrasion terraces on the 
shelf (Kowsmann &amp;amp; Costa, 1974; Martins et al., 1996). The 
deposits of the shelf containing terrestrial remains were formed 
during sea-level regressions, when large portions of the then 
exposed shelf were occupied by terrestrial ecosystems (Lopes 
et al., 2010; Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2010).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Systematic collecting of fossils along the beaches of Rio 
Grande do Sul State has been performed in the last 15 years 
by researchers from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande 
(FURG). The collection sites are concentrated in the southern 
portion of the coast, between the estuary of Patos Lagoon and 
Chuí Creek. During these activities, 1 km-long sections of the 
coast, between the surf zone and frontal dunes, are surveyed 
for fossils and geological samples. The remains are found 
disarticulated and exhibit signs of abrasion by transport; 
most fossils are incomplete, and compact-shaped elements 
such as osteoderms, astragali and phalanges are generally the 
best preserved (Lopes et al., 2008). The occurrence of fossils 
along the coast is not uniform (Buchmann, 1994). The largest 
concentration of mammalian remains is found in a ~40 km-long 
sector where large and thick konzentrat-lagerstätte of fossil 
marine shells, called “concheiros” (Figure 2) are formed on 
the beach by redeposition of bioclasts transported from the 
continental shelf by storm waves (Figueiredo Jr., 1975).

The studied specimens, a total of 2,391 fossils, are deposited 
in the paleontological collection of FURG. Each specimen 
was identified to the lowest taxonomic category where 
possible, and classified as cranial elements (skulls, mandibles, 
antlers), isolated teeth, axial elements (vertebrae and ribs), 
appendicular elements (scapulae and long bones), podials 
(carpals, metacarpals, tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges) and 
accessory elements (osteoderms, caudal tubes).

RESULTS

The most abundant skeletal elements are osteoderms of 
cingulates, followed by teeth (Figure 3). The most common 
cranial elements are incomplete cervid antlers and fragments 
of the occipital portion of skulls; the most complete skull 
is almost unrecognizable, but seems to be of a ground sloth

because of the internal pneumatization (Figure 4A). The most 
common podial elements are astragali (Figures 4B, C), followed 
by phalanges and carpals/tarsals (Figure 4D). Long bones are 
represented essentially by incomplete specimens (Figures 4E-G). 
Vertebrae include complete specimens, but most are incomplete 
or fragments represented by centra without neural arches and 
isolated neural spines, difficult to assign to any specific taxon. 
Scapulae and ribs are all incomplete specimens.

Of the total analyzed specimens, 214 could not be 
taxonomically identified due to reworking by marine dynamics,

which destroys most of the diagnostic characters by abrasion 
and/or fragmentation (Lopes et al., 2008). These include 121 
vertebrae, 33 podials, 26 long bones, 22 scapulae, 9 skulls 
and 3 ribs. The remaining 2,177 elements could be assigned 
to several taxonomic groups (Figure 5), but not all known taxa 
from the continental shelf are represented, among them the 
rodents and canids. The most common taxa are artiodactyls, 
represented mostly by antler fragments, podials and teeth. 
Among the antlers, 145 could be identified, being 28 of Antifer 
Ameghino, 1,889 and 117 of Morenelaphus Carette, 1922; the 
remaining 167 could not be assigned to any specific genus due 
to abrasion and fragmentation. Podials and teeth of this group 
are very common and well preserved; however, a detailed 
revision is needed in order to distinguish between cervids and 
camelids. The medium-sized taxa (those with body mass between 
10 and 100 kg, according to estimates by Fariña et al., 1998), 
represented by cervids, are the most common, followed by large-
sized ones (body masses between 100 and more than 1000 kg), 
such as glyptodontids, ground sloths, toxodontids, litopterns, 
proboscideans and carnivores. Although Fariña et al. (1998) 
and Cione et al. (2003) did not provide estimates of body mass 
for pampatheriids and proterotheriids, these can be considered 
medium-sized taxa.

Cingulate xenarthrans are very common, with glyptodontids 
as the most conspicuous group, followed by pampatheriids and

incomplete caudal tubes attributed to Panochthus. Pampatheriids 
are represented by 116 osteoderms of Pampatherium Ameghino, 
1875 and 53 of Holmesina Simpson, 1930. The most numerous 
are the elongated, subrectangular osteoderms of the mobile 
belt, although elements from the cephalic shield and pelvic and 
pectoral bucklers are common. The genus Pachyarmatherium 
Downing &amp;amp; White, 1995 is represented by only three osteoderms. 
This taxon was only recently described from fossiliferous 
deposits of the continental shelf (Bostelmann et al., 2008; 
Ribeiro, 2008) and also from Pleistocene deposits in northeastern 
Brazil (Porpino et al., 2009). Dasypodid fossils are very scarce, 
consisting of only seven osteoderms attributed to Propraopus

dasypodids (Figure 6). Glyptodontids are easily diagnosed by the 
external morphology of the carapace osteoderms. The identified 
genera include Glyptodon Owen, 1845 (501 specimens), 
Panochthus Burmeister, 1872 (44), Doedicurus Burmeister, 
1874 (23) and Neuryurus Ameghino, 1889 (8). Identification 
of the latter, which have osteoderms with irregular surface 
and without distinct textures (Zurita et al., 2006) is sometimes 
dubious, because abrasion can obliterate the fine-scale textures 
on osteoderms of Panochthus making them look like Neuryurus. 
Some specimens of Glyptodon and Panochthus are represented 
by two or more fused osteoderms. Besides osteoderms, the only 
identified glyptodontid remains are two teeth fragments and 



REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 15(1), 201262

Ameghino, 1881, plus three others that could not be identified.
Remains of pilose xenarthrans include members of the 

Mylodontidae (131 specimens) and Megatheriidae (44). 
Mylodontid sloths are represented by Glossotherium Gervais, 
1855 (22 specimens), Lestodon Gervais, 1855 (14), Mylodon 
Owen, 1839 (11) and Catonyx Ameghino, 1891 (5), as well as 
83 unidentified specimens. The most conspicuous fossils of this 
group are isolated teeth, which are difficult to identify because 
of the similar morphology of the first molariform teeth. In 
Catonyx, the teeth have a subtriangular transverse profile distinct 
from those of the mylodontines. Other features that allowed 
distinguishing between some genera are the morphology of the 
distal portion of the tibia and the astragalus (Kraglievich, 1934). 
The megatheriid sloths were identified by teeth (38 specimens) 
and one ungual phalange. Although Megatherium Cuvier, 1796 
is the only megatheriid cited for the deposits of the CPRS, the 
genus Eremotherium Spillmann, 1948, previously recorded from 
other areas of Rio Grande do Sul (Toledo, 1986; Oliveira et al., 

2002), was recently identified in the CPRS from deposits of Chuí 
Creek (Pereira et al., 2010), so it is possible that this genus may 
also be present among the remains from the continental shelf. 

Among the Toxodontidae, the only genus recognized for Rio 
Grande do Sul is Toxodon Owen, 1838, although a Toxodontidae 
indet. was recognized the continental shelf by a distal portion of 
a femur (Paula Couto, 1944; Cunha, 1959) and Oliveira (1992) 
mentioned the presence of the genus Trigodon Ameghino, 
1887 on the basis a fragmentary tooth from the continental 
shelf. Toxodon was identified in the present analysis by 189 
teeth, 15 long bones, 3 skull fragments and 1 astragalus (Figure 
7A). Litopterns are rare in the fossil deposits of Rio Grande 
do Sul (Scherer et al., 2009). The macraucheniid litopterns are 
represented by two fragmentary teeth and a cervical vertebra of 
Macrauchenia Owen, 1838 (Figure 7B), while protherotheriids 
are represented by a single astragalus, attributed to Neolicaphrium 
Frenguelli, 1921 (Figure 7C).

The Gomphotheriids found in the CPRS are represented by 
the genus Stegomastodon Pohlig, 1912 according to Marcon 
(2007). Fossils of this taxon are mostly teeth (62 specimens), but 
two fragments of dentaries and one tibia were also identified. 
The teeth include both molar and incisors, mostly fragmented 
(Figures 7D, E). The most common equid remains are teeth 
(Figure 7F), although two metatarsals were also identified in 
the collection. A detailed revision of this material is needed, 
because the abrasion and fragmentary condition of most of 
the teeth make it difficult to assign them to a specific genus. 
However, the identified specimens belong to Equus Linnaeus, 
1758 and Hippidion Owen, 1869, previously identified among 
the material from the continental shelf (Cunha, 1959) and from 
Chuí Creek (Pereira et al., 2010). The only carnivore specimen 
in the collection is a left astragalus of Smilodon Lund, 1842 
(Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2010).

DISCUSSION

The analysis of the fossil specimens revealed important 
variations in the relative proportions among the different 
mammalian taxonomic groups and respective skeletal elements 
(Figure 8). Considering that the fossil assemblage from the 
continental shelf contains remains that encompass a time span 
of some 700 ky BP (Lopes et al., 2010), reworked and mixed 
together by the late Pleistocene-early Holocene sea-level 
oscillations, such variations cannot be attributed only to intrinsic 
aspects of the paleocommunities. The abundance of glyptodontids 
among the specimens is a combination of the large number of 
osteoderms (up to 2000) in the carapace of an individual, plus 
the small size and compact shape of the osteoderms, which 
cause them to be easily transported by waves and currents. 
Among the glyptodontid specimens, however, the predominance 
of Glyptodon over other genera probably reflects the original 
diversity pattern among these taxa. Given the similar shape and 
dimensions of the carapace osteoderms found in these taxa, which 
results in similar preservation and transport potentials, one should 
expect to find similar proportions among these genera; however, 
the marked differences suggest a greater relative abundance of 
Glyptodon over the other genera in the paleoecosystems of the 
CPRS. A similar pattern is found among glyptodontid remains 
from Chuí Creek, which seem to represent a shorter time interval. 

Pilose xenarthrans also present differences in relative 
abundance, with megatheriids less abundant that mylodontids. 
Among the latter, the mylodontines, represented by Glossotherium, 
Lestodon and Mylodon are more abundant than scelidotheriines, 
represented solely by Catonyx according to Lopes &amp;amp; Pereira 
(2010). Gaudin (2004) stated that the low representativity of 
scelidotheriines in Pleistocene fossil assemblages is a product 
of the low taxonomic diversity of this group. 

The record of carnivores is also very scarce, possibly 
reflecting the low specific richness of this group in South America 
(Prevosti &amp;amp; Vizcaíno, 2006). Ecological factors may also be 
responsible for the low representativity of large-bodied taxa such 
as Tapirus and Macrauchenia. The abundance of large mammals 
that presumably inhabited open grassland environments such 
as ground sloths, mastodonts and glyptodonts (Oliveira, 1999) 
indicates that the Pleistocene environments of the CPRS were 
mostly open environments, which would not be suitable for 
the forest-dwelling Tapirus. Although its remains can be found 
from Bolivia to Chile (Scherer et al., 2009), it is not clear why 
Macrauchenia is so scarce in the coastal area of Rio Grande do 
Sul. Given that this taxon had low-crowned teeth, it is possible 
that it could feed only on trees and shrubs with soft leaves, 
instead of the abrasive grasses found in grassland environments. 
A detailed review on the teeth and postcranial specimens of 
artiodactyls from the CPRS is necessary in order to evaluate the 
relative proportion between camelids and cervids.

Other factors to be considered regarding the representativity 
of the fossils involve taphonomy, mostly the selection by 
transport and mechanical destruction of the fossils by waves. 
The fossils are preserved in biodetrital accumulations on the 
continental shelf until their removal and transportation to the 
beach by storm waves (Buchmann, 2002; Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 
2010). This process seems to be the main one responsible for 
the low proportion of large cranial and postcranial remains of 
large-bodied taxa such as sloths, toxodontids and gomphotheriids. 
While smaller, more compact remains of small-bodied taxa are 

easily transported by waves under normal conditions, the larger 
elements can be transported only by high energy waves, which 
occur only during extreme storms (Calliari et al., 1998; Lopes 
et al., 2006). Thus, these large remains rarely come to the beach, 
but once deposited there, would be removed only by a similar 
storm, so their residence time on the beach is longer than that 
of a small fossil continuously moved by normal wave regimes. 

Given that the selective transportation results in relatively few 
large skeletal elements of large-bodied taxa being deposited on 
the beach, one could expect to find a relatively larger proportion 
of fossils of smaller-bodied taxa. However, the continuous 
transportation and reworking in the surf zone by wave action even 
under normal meteorological conditions results in a higher degree 
of abrasion, fragmentation and finally destruction of these remains. 
Even more massive skeletal remains are mostly fragmented 
and abraded; smaller and more compact-shaped elements are 
complete but most exhibit a high degree of abrasion due to their 
higher transportation potential (Lopes et al., 2008). This process 
explains the abundance of podials of artiodactyls. The abundance 
of osteoderms of glyptodonts and pampatheriids is a combination 
of the large proportion of these elements from a single individual 
and the higher transportability of these elements. The osteoderms 
of smaller cingulates, such as dasypodids, are more prone to 
mechanical destruction and abrasion in comparison to osteoderms 
of glyptodonts and pampatheriids, thus are less abundant. 

The higher mechanical resistance of teeth, even those of the 
xenarthrans that do not bear enamel, contributes to the large 
proportion of such remains. The abrasion and destruction of most 
of the fossils is not just a product of present day marine dynamics, 
but can also be attributed to past sea-level transgressions. 
Dillenburg (1994) demonstrated that a marine transgression 
could erode the upper 10 m of the continental shelf, which would 
also affect the fossil remains preserved in this area. Past fluvial 
dynamics could also promote mechanical alteration on these 
fossils; studies have shown that during sea-level low stands 
several fluvial channels existed on the exposed portions of the 
shelf (Weschenfelder et al., 2008; Silva, 2009), thus these rivers 
could also have transported and destroyed the fossil remains.

The fossil assemblage of the continental shelf represents a 
time interval that encompasses at least the last 700 ky BP, which 
was marked by glacioeustatic oscillations. These oscillations 
reworked and mixed together remains of distinct ages, creating 
a large parautochthonous assemblage that represents a large 
time-averaging interval (Lopes et al., 2010). This mixing 
is responsible for the co-occurrence of non-analogous taxa 
(sensu Lundelius, 1989), such as organisms that inhabit open, 
semiarid environments (Dolichotinae, Reithrodon), together with 
others that indicate forested (Tapirus) and permanently humid 
(Myocastor, Hydrochoerus) environments. Alternatively, this 
mixing could be related to the existence in the Pleistocene of 
environmental conditions not found in modern ecosystems. A 
similar pattern is observed in fossil assemblages from continental 
deposits of the Sopas Formation of Uruguay (Ubilla, 2004) and 
Chuí Creek, although in the latter the mixing could be in fact the 
result of time-averaging and erosive processes (Lopes, in press).

CONCLUSIONS

Although the fossil assemblage from the southern Brazilian 
continental shelf does not represent a single paleocommunity 
or paleoecosystem, and encompasses remains of different ages, 



65AIRES &amp;amp; LOPES  –  QUATERNARY MAMMALS FROM SOUTHERN BRAZIL

the analysis of the skeletal remains revealed that the taxonomic 
representativity of this assemblage seems to be influenced by a 
combination of ecological and taphonomic factors. The relative 
abundance among glyptodontid taxa from this assemblage 
probably reflects the original taxonomic abundance within this 
group, with Glyptodon being more diverse and abundant than 
other glyptodontids. The low ecological diversity explains the 
scarcity of fossils of carnivores and scelidotheriine sloths. The 
relative absence of other taxa such as Macrauchenia and Tapirus 
seems to be related to ecological factors, given that remains 
of these large-bodied taxa would not be as much affected by 
taphonomic factors as the small-bodied taxa. This question 
could be resolved with detailed paleoecological studies and 
comparison with other geographically and temporally close 
fossil assemblages.

Taphonomic factors affect the relative proportions of taxa 
by selective transportation and destruction of the smaller and/or 
compact-shaped remains. Once removed from the deposits on the 
shelf, these remains are continuously moved and transported by 
waves that promote their abrasion and destruction; this process 
would be a major reason for the relative absence of small organisms 
such as rodents and proterotheriids. Larger elements, on the other 
hand, are removed and transported to the beach only on rare 
occasions when extreme storm waves affect the deposits. 

The high proportion of osteoderms of glyptodontids and 
pampatheriids results from a combination of the large number 
of these elements on a single individual, plus their higher 
transportation potential due to their small size and compact 
shape. The lower proportion of the smaller osteoderms of 
dasypodids, however, is likely to be a result of mechanical 
fragmentation and abrasion.

The results presented here are partially hampered by the 
abrasion and fragmentation of most of the specimens, and 
also by the lack of a detailed revision of certain groups (e.g. 
Mylodontidae, Equidae). A careful taxonomic analysis shall 
improve the taxonomic resolution of the material and improve 
the estimates of diversity of those groups.

Although it cannot be considered as representing a 
paleocommunity or paleoenvironment, given the large time-
averaging of the remains, further research on continental fossil 
localities of more restricted age should provide additional 
information regarding the Pleistocene mammalian communities 
and a means for paleoecological comparisons with the 
assemblage from the continental shelf. This study also reinforces 
the importance of evaluating the taphonomic processes that affect 
fossil assemblages when using fossil remains for reconstructing 
paleoenvironments and paleocommunities.
