Resumo 

Hoje em dia, não é ainda completamente claro de que maneira o fundo dos oceanos podem 

contribuir para os Ecossistemas da Terra. Contudo, vários esforços estão a ser feito para 

compreender em profundidade os fundos marinhos dos Oceanos. Atualmente, o método mais 

eficiente, já desenvolvido, para explorar a profundeza dos oceanos é conhecido como veículos 

submarinos, e especificamente, o mais eficiente para pesquisa e exploração destes é conhecido 

como Veículo Autónomo Subaquático (AUV). O aumento do uso de AUV’s tem levado a um ponto 

em que os parâmetros de projeto são cruciais. Características como a resistência ao avanço, o 

alto tempo de operação, a grande manobrabilidade e o grande alcance são exigidos numa fase 

primária de projeto; desta forma, é fundamental encontrar uma forma ótima do corpo 

hidrodinâmico, ainda durante a fase de projeto, ambicionando melhorar as suas características. 

Esta dissertação apresenta o efeito das forças hidrodinâmicas de veículos subaquáticos axi- 

simétricos através da variação da forma de um corpo em forma de torpedo. Além disso, nesta 

dissertação pretende-se ainda analisar, experimentalmente, os rácios comprimento/diâmetro 

do nariz e da cauda do corpo, assim como as suas formas, para que seja possível os rácios e 

combinação ótimos do ponto de vista da minimização da resistência ao avanço. Os testes 

experimentais foram feitos num tanque de água da Universidade da Beira Interior (UBI). No 

entanto, devido às dimensões do tanque de água, o desenvolvimento de um modelo à escala 

foi a opção mais viável. Uma similaridade entre o modelo à escala e o protótipo foi feita para 

garantir as mesmas condições de escoamento entre ambos. Várias combinações foram testadas 

experimentalmente e seguidamente validadas por simulações numéricas. Adicionalmente, 

parâmetros como o ângulo de ataque (de 0 - 20?) e a velocidade (entre 0.50 – 1 m/s) foram 

alterados para perceber a sua influência na resistência hidrodinâmica. A preparação 

experimental é totalmente descrita, mostrando vários procedimentos adotados até à fase de 

recolha de dados. Um sistema de tensão/compressão (célula de carga) foi utilizado para medir 

a resistência induzido pelo corpo. Os resultados experimentais demonstraram uma configuração 

ótima que se situa nas proximidades de N/D = 0.8 (Forma Elítica) e T/D = 1.6 (Forma Cónica). 

Pode ser visto que a resistência aumenta com o aumento da velocidade. Da mesma forma para 

os ângulos de ataque, a resistência aumenta para ângulos de ataque maiores. Os dados 

experimentais foram usados para validar os resultados obtidos de um software CFD que usa as 

equações RANS. Um estudo de independência da malha foi feito para investigar dois modelos 

turbulentos: Modelos Standard ?-? e ?-? SST.  O modelo turbulento Standard ?-? mostrou ser o 

mais apropriado para este estudo com um menor custo computacional. Os resultados entre os 

métodos experimentais e numéricos mostraram uma boa concordância, considerando as 

condições mencionadas.

Abstract 

Nowadays, it is not fully clear how the Ocean seabed can contribute to Earth ecosystems. 

However, several steps are being taken to completely understand Ocean’s seabed. Lately, many 

methods are being developed to explore the Oceans, although there is one method which fulfill 

the desired trade-off (between low operational costs and high quality data collection). This 

efficient method developed to explore the Ocean’s depth is known as submarine vehicles, and 

the most efficient of them, to explore and mapping, is certainly the Autonomous Underwater 

Vehicle (AUV). The increasing use of AUV’s is leading to a point in which its design parameters 

are crucial. Characteristics as high endurance, long operation time, high maneuverability and 

range are demanded at an early design stage; thus, it is essential to find an optimum hull shape 

design to improve these characteristics. This thesis presents the effect of hydrodynamic forces 

of axisymmetric underwater vehicles through the variation of the shape of a torpedo-shaped 

hull body. Furthermore, this thesis is intended to analyze, experimentally, the length-to-

Diameter (D) ratios of nose (N) and tail (T), as well as its shapes, in order to find the optimum 

ratios and shape combinations for the minimization of Drag. The experimental tests were 

conducted in the towing tank of the University of Beira Interior (UBI).  However, due to the 

Towing Tank dimensions, the development of a scaled model had to be made. A similarity 

between the scaled model and the full-scale prototype must be done to assume similar flow 

conditions. Several torpedo-shaped combinations were tested experimentally and further 

validated the numerical simulations. Moreover, parameters such as the pitch angles (or Angle 

of Attack (AoA)) [0 - 20?] and velocities [0.50 – 1 m/s] were investigated to understand their 

influence on the hydrodynamic Drag. The experimental setup is hereby fully described, showing 

the various procedures adopted until the data collection phase. A strain gauge system (load 

cell) was used to measure the Drag induced by the hull body. Experimental results demonstrate 

an optimum configuration for N/D = 0.8 (Elliptical shape) and T/D = 1.6 (Conical shape). From 

the experimental and numerical data, it could be seen that the Drag increases with the increase 

of velocity. Same occurrence happens for AoA, where Drag increases with higher AoA’s. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that the influence of AoA on Drag is higher for greater velocities. 

The experimental measurements have been used to validate results obtained from a 

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software that uses Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) 

equations (ANSYSTM FLUENT). A mesh-independency study was made to investigate two 

turbulence models: Standard ?-? and ?-? SST models. Standard ?-? showed to be the most 

appropriate model to this study with a lower computational cost. Results between Experimental 

and Numerical methods showed a good agreement, considering the conditions mentioned.

1 Introduction 

1.1 Motivation 

Oceans are a significant component of the Earth’s surface forming the majority of the 

hydrosphere. It is certain that the ocean covers more than 2/3 of the Earth’s surface, being a 

fundamental reason of human’s existence on Earth. Moreover, the average depth of the ocean 

is 3680 meters and the greatest ocean depth of the oceans is found in Mariana’s trench, with 

10911 m depth. However, only about 5% of the oceans bottoms have been explored [1]. 

Therefore, it is extremely important to explore as much as possible this unknown area and 

understand how oceans can improve human lives. The collection of ocean data by observation 

and tracking in actual sea is crucial.  

In order to understand the ocean, several tools have been used in the offshore industry since 

the late 1960s. These tools must comply with certain characteristics to carry out their functions 

[2]. Lately, tools as Human Occupied Vehicles (HOV’s), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV’s) 

and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV’s) are being used for an extensive and complex 

study of the oceans, revolutionizing the process of gathering ocean data [1], [3]. However, the 

relative high cost of using instruments lowered from research ships (HOV’s) or tethered robots 

(ROV’s) and their limitations such as the need for a communications tether or an operating 

vessel have limited their use. Consequently, AUV’s became a common tool in ocean sampling 

by being independent, and are now an indispensable feature for collecting ocean data providing 

a safe, cost-effective and reliable alternative to manned or remotely controlled systems [4]–

[7]. 

In recent years, AUV’s are becoming a powerful tool in deep ocean research, being increasingly 

used in areas such as, the exploration of underwater environments, maintenance and repair of 

submerged structures, mineral exploration, military use, pipeline inspection, mine-sweeping 

and many other areas [8], [9]. These several distinct applications give rise to a large number 

of different vehicle shapes and sizes. The design of AUV’s is conducted by a demanding tradeoff 

between the crucial requirements of the missions, and the main constraints of fabrication, 

assembly and operational logistics. However, an AUV is limited when power requirements are 

concerned, which directly impacts its characteristics, such as velocity, range and endurance of 

the vehicle [6], [10]. Thus, it is crucial to find an efficient hydrodynamic design that reduce 

power consumption, and in turn, increase AUV’s autonomy. In order to improve its performance 

on a design project level, the reduction of hull’s hydrodynamic resistance must be the main

focus. Therefore, an increasing use of AUV’s leads the need to investigate and predict, 

efficiently, the hydrodynamic forces acting over an AUV [11].  

This research thesis further analyzes, through the use of experimental and numerical methods, 

the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients of an AUV with a torpedo shape operating under 

deeply submerged conditions. The AUV model velocity, Angle of Attack (AoA), Nose Length / 

Diameter and Tail Length / Diameter ratios are investigated to study their effect on 

hydrodynamics performance of submerged vehicles. For this purpose, a detailed experimental 

procedure has to be performed by a numerical study using a commercial Computational Fluid 

Dynamics (CFD) tool, FLUENT ANSYS 16.0., being the ultimate goal of this thesis the validation 

of the numerical simulation against the experimental procedure, allowing for the optimization 

of the overall AUV body. 

1.2 Research Objectives and Aim 

CEiia - the Centre of Engineering and Product Development challenged the author of this thesis 

to study, experimentally and numerically, the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients of an AUV 

model based on MEDUSA DEEP-SEA AUV type. MEDUSA Deep-Sea AUV is a double-hull design that 

is currently being developed by a group of partners: CEiiA, Instituto de Sistemas e Robótica 

(ISR) from Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), The Portuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute, I.P. 

(IPMA, IP), EMEPC (Estrutura de Missão para a Extensão da Plataforma Continental) 

(governmental structure with a mission to prepare/monitor the process of extending the 

continental shelf of Portugal), Institute of Marine Research (IMAR) and Argus Remote Systems 

AS. This project embraces the design and production of a specific AUV for the required 

conditions imposed initially to operate at 3000 m of depth and with a specific payload. More 

details about this project are shown in reference [12]. Vehicle’s configuration is shown in Figure 

1.1. This thesis is not a part of MEDUSA Deep-Sea project, being rather considered a parallel 

study which might help optimize this vehicle’s hydrodynamic hull efficiency.

2 Literature Review and Significant Theory 

It is essential to understand background knowledge and fundamental milestones about the AUV 

history, as well as, similar studies made by other authors. It is also important to understand 

the reasons for the underwater vehicle’s shape at different phases of their development and 

some notable achievements. 

2.1 History 

AUV’s are directly linked to streamlined bodies, being the majority torpedo-shaped. The first 

torpedo was invented by Robert Whitehead in Austria in 1866 [13], [14], but this concept only 

started being dominant and reliable since World War II (WWII) [15]. The name Torpedo came 

from the Torpedo fish, which is an electric ray capable of delivering a stunning shock to its 

prey. The torpedo can be considered the first AUV, if the fact that it carried an explosive 

payload is ignored. Furthermore, this torpedo achieved a speed of 3 m/s and ran around 700 m 

[16]. The torpedo-shaped is a crucial parameter for this study because it is straightly connected 

with actual AUV’s design. 

The development of UUV’s started in the 1960’s and some initial research was made about the 

utility of UUV’s. The first successful one was developed as early as 1957 in the Applied Physics 

Laboratory at the University of Washington to gather data from the Arctic regions. This UUV 

was named as the Special Purpose Underwater Research Vehicle (SPURV I) and was subject of 

study until the mid 70’s. Between the 70’s and 80’s the SPURV II was adopted, an upgrade more 

capable than SPURV I. Altogether were released over 400 SPURV [16], [17]. Table 2.1 shows 

some of SPURV I’s specifications.

In 1973, the Naval Ocean System Center, now known as Space and Naval Warfare Systems 

Command (SPAWAR) started to develop the Advanced Unmanned Search System (AUSS). This 

vehicle was ready for the first launch ten years later, in 1983. Had a displacement of 907 kg, 

with 5,2 m long and 0,8 m of diameter, completed over 114 dives being some of them to 6000 

m of depth [5], [16]. 

In 1976, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) designed Epulard 

vehicle. This vehicle was assembled by 1978 and was operational for the first dive in 1980. It 

had a maximum depth of 6000 m and was acoustically controlled, Epulard completed about 300 

dives between 1970 and 1990 [16]. 

During the 70’s, other AUV’s were also developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

(MIT). Later, in 1997, a group of engineers from the MIT AUV Laboratory founded BLUEFIN 

ROBOTICS. This company develops, builds, and operates AUV’s and related technologies. 

Recently, was acquired by General Dynamics Mission Systems, a business unit of General 

Dynamics [19]. 

In 1980, the “International Symposium on Unmanned Untethered Submersible Technology” 

(UUST) was created in Durham, New Hampshire, United States of America (USA), with twenty-

four technologist attending this conference. Seven years later, more than 320 people were 

representing more than 100 companies, 20 Universities and 20 federal agencies on the meeting 

[17].

During the 80’s, there were many technological advances apart from AUV community that 

critically improved AUV development. Improvements like software systems and size reduction 

of hardware systems were crucial. Following Busby’s 1987 Undersea Vehicle Directory, there 

were six operational AUV’s and other 15 vehicles considered prototypes or under construction 

by 1987 [5], [16]. 

In 1990, the HUGIN AUV program started in a project between KONGSBERG and the Norwegian 

Defence Research Establishment (FFI). Since its development has been the most capable and 

successful commercial AUV in operation. Figure 2.1 shows the HUGIN AUV Product Range and 

their specifications [20], [21]. 

 

 

Figure 2.1 – Specifications of several HUGIN AUV’s [20]. 

In the 90’s, the first generation of operational systems able to be tasked to perform defined 

objectives appeared, in other words, AUV’s grew from proof of concept to a final result. 

Therewith, the interest in AUV’s academic research increased quickly. 

During the 90’s, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sea Grand AUV lab developed six 

Odyssey vehicles. These vehicles had a displacement of 160 kg, with an operational speed of 



History  Chapter 2 • Literature Review and Significant 
Theory 

 10 

1.5 m/s, operating for up to six hours and were assigned to 6000 m of depth. In 1994, these 

vehicles operated under ice, and in 1995 operated for 3 hours in the open ocean to a depth of 

1400 m [16], [17]. 

Almost at the same time, in the early 90’s, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) 

developed the Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) (see Figure 2.2). ABE completed its first 

scientific mission in 1994, had a displacement of 680 kg and its dives typically lasted about 16 

to 34 hours depending on the instrument payload and bottom terrain. This vehicle was the first 

one to be completely independent of the surface vessel and capable of covering large areas of 

underwater terrain. ABE was extremely maneuverable due to its six thrusters. Its deepest dive 

to date was  4000 m, in its at least 80 dives [5], [16]. Figure 2.2 demonstrates ABE AUV attached 

to the Launch And Recovering System (LARS). 

 

Figure 2.2 – ABE AUV during a mission (adapted from [1]). 

At the same time, the South Hampton Oceanography Center’s AUTOSUB was developed. 

AUTOSUB was the first vehicle prepared for long duration missions, having completed its first 

scientific mission in 1998. With a travelling speed of 1.5 m/s, it displaces 1700 kg and can 

operate for up to six days. This vehicle has completed over 270 missions covering more than 

3500 km. Its longest mission lasted 50 hours [5], [16]. 

In the late 90’s, WHOI’s Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS) vehicle was developed 

in the Oceanographic Systems Lab (now marketed by Hydroid, owned by Kongsberg Group in 

2007) to support scientific objectives at the LEO-15 observatory in Tuckerton, New Jersey. Its 

first scientific mission was in 1997 and there are currently over 50 REMUS vehicles in 20 

different configurations that are being independently operated by universities and agencies, so 

it is not possible to determine how many missions have been performed by REMUS. With a 

displacement of 36 kg, it can operate for up to 20 hours at 1.5 m/s and to a depth of 100 m. 



Chapter 2 • Literature Review and Significant Theory  History 

 11 

Its longest mission lasted 17 hours, with an operational speed of 1.75 m/s at a maximum depth 

of 20 m of the coast of New Jersey [1], [16]. The Figure 2.3 shows a recent version of a REMUS 

AUV, the REMUS 6000. This vehicle can operate in water depths up to 6000 m and its autonomy 

depend on its speed/sensor configuration (typical mission duration is 22 hr). 

 

Figure 2.3 – REMUS 6000 operating near free surface (adapted from [22]). 

In 1997, the HUGIN I AUV made the first commercial survey operation for the Ásgard Gas 

Transport Pipeline Route. This is an important milestone for the AUV civilian application. This 

survey confirmed the expected improvements in efficiency and data quality by the use of AUV’s. 

From 2001, these vehicles have been successfully used for military application [20]. 

In 2004 the Navy UUV Master Plan was issued. This plan defines UUV missions in the following 

prioritized order [23]:  

1. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; 

2. Mine Countermeasures (MCM); 

3. Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW); 

4. Inspection/Identification; 

5. Oceanography; 

6. Communications/Navigation Network Node (CN3); 

7. Payload Delivery. 

This UUV Master Plan is a document recommending AUV missions and technologies. 

Since the beginning of this century, it became clear that the use of AUV technology was of 

great value for several commercial tasks. There is a transitioning point in which AUV technology 

will definitely move from the research environment into the commercial offshore industry. 

Although, there are some parameters to be performed, such as the economic viability of the 



Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV’s)  Chapter 2 • Literature Review and Significant

 12 

technology and some technological problems, to continue its advance for industry to embrace 

its potential. 

Currently, there are many companies on the AUV industry such as Kongsberg Maritime (owner 

of the most-known brands as REMUS, HUGIN, MUNIN or SEAGLIDER), BLUEFIN ROBOTICS or 

International Submarine Engineering. These companies are being constantly supported by 

research institutions as WHOI, MIT AUV Laboratory or Kongsberg Group (two centuries business 

company, owner of Kongsberg Maritime) to expand this industry. 

2.2 Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV’s) 

Since the main topic of this thesis is AUV’s, it is not relevant to have an exhaustive study about 

all marine vehicles. However, it is extremely important to understand their global classification 

like it is shown in Figure 2.4.  

 

Figure 2.4 - Global classification of marine vehicles. 

Unmanned Vehicles can be described by dividing them into two categories: Underwater Vehicles 

and Surface Vehicles.

Concepts 

 13 

The Unmanned Surface Vehicles, most known as Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV’s) are 

vehicles that only operate in the ocean’s surface. Depending on its vessel, length and power 

supply, they can operate for a considerable time (weeks or months). 

The Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV’s) are mainly separated into three categories: 

Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and Autonomous 

Underwater Glider (AUG). Depending on each specific task, the type of UUV should be chosen 

properly. However, characteristics such as high endurance, long operation time, high 

maneuverability and range are always desired. The relationships between those four 

characteristics are shown in Figure 2.5.    

 

 

Figure 2.5 - Relationship between Endurance, Time, Range and Maneuverability (adapted 

from [4]). 

2.3 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles – Design and Concepts 

The design of an AUV depends on its mission and in a preliminary design concept it is highly 

important to understand which geometry/shape is better for the desired mission. 

Nowadays, with the development of technology came the increase in the use of AUV’s. Mainly, 

there are three different types of applications for AUV’s: 

- Commercial: directly linked with oil and gas industries; its traditional missions are 

the mapping and tracking of the seafloor before construct any infrastructure, also 

pipelines can be monitored easily. 

- Defense: obviously connected with defense or protection; this AUV application 

involve missions as mine detection, monitoring an area to identify unknown objects 

and detection of manned submarines (anti-submarine warfare). 

- Research: this is the pioneer application, came with the necessity to know the 

ocean’s life and study precisely new elements attached to the sea floor. 

Depending on each mission, there are several variables that can be changed during the 

preliminary design such as, for example, the AUV Length (L) and/or Diameter (D).

2.4 General Design of an AUV 

There are some aspects in AUV design that need special attention, and are known as major 

design aspects. These aspects include: hull design, propulsion, submerging and electric power 

[2]. Therefore, these aspects can be subdivided into several subsystems as [23]: 

- the pressure container; 

- the hydrodynamic hull; 

- ballasting; 

- power and energy; 

- electrical-power distribution; 

- propulsion; 

- navigation and positioning; 

- obstacle avoidance; 

- masts; 

- maneuver control; 

- communications; 

- locator and emergency equipment; 

- payloads. 

Since the aim of this thesis is to estimate/calculate the hydrodynamic forces/coefficients, it is 

crucial to improve backgrounds in hull design, and specifically in hydrodynamic hull. For a 

detailed study about the subsystems please refer to the references [2], [23]. 

2.4.1 Hydrodynamic Design 

An AUV when travelling through the ocean should be highly hydrodynamic or as much as possible 

streamlined. Frequently, the components housing defines several restrictions as minimum 

Diameter (cross-sectional area) or Length, and these restrictions directly affect the body’s 

hydrodynamic. Reduce Drag (DT), or also known as Resistance Force (??), is always one of the 

main design objectives. Moreover, the flow over an AUV’s body should be controlled for an 

efficient propulsion i.e. laminar flow designs should be chosen  [23]. Maximum cross section 

from nose and nose/tail radius (same length with different curvature) are parameters that also 

have influence on resistance force, but since they are not controllable due to the constraints 

of this study, will be neglected. The FR depends on a set of phenomena as can be shown in 

Figure 2.6.

Where all parameters are known from the Equation (2.1). The author considered relevant to 

describe these two similar equations, since these are fundamental for this study. 

Generally, the resistance force can be divided into three different components: form drag or 

pressure drag (also known as viscous pressure resistance), friction resistance and wave 

resistance. Since this study is for a fully submerged mode i.e. there is no free surface effect. 

Knowing that the main difference between submerged mode and surfaced mode is wave-

breaking and wave-making, the wave resistance is neglected in the scope of this study. To 

understand the influence of free surface effect (two-phase flow condition) see E. Dawson [25]. 

Henceforth, a fully submerged condition is always assumed by the author. Therefore, there are 

two dominant factors responsible by the submerged body’s resistance to motion when moving 

in a homogenous viscous fluid domain: friction resistance (tangential shear forces) and viscous 

pressure resistance (normal pressure forces) resistance, as marked in Figure 2.6. 

The friction resistance coefficient is given by the Equation (2.3): 

 ?? =  
0.075

(log10 ?? ? 2)
2
 (2.3) 

Where ??  is the non-dimensional frictional resistance coefficient and ?? is the Reynolds 

number. Knowing ??  and ??  (given in Equation (2.2))  the Residual Drag coefficient (??) can be 

obtained from the Equation (2.4): 

 ?? =  ?? ? ??  (2.4) 

The residual drag is a significant parameter for hydrodynamic studies defined as total resistance 

except for skin friction drag. 

The influence of each component on resistance force is dependent on the size and shape of the 

body, as shown in Figure 2.7. There is no precise minimum in total drag but various authors 

refer an optimum L/D ratio for a streamlined body is between 6 and 7. This optimum value 

changes depending on its shape. In order to reduce the form resistance, the hull length can be 

extended. However, the resultant increase in length and wetted surface area leads to an 

increase in friction resistance. Then, the effects of L/D ratio on the two components are 

contradictory, where the lowest point of total resistance force is related to the optimum L/D 

ratio, as shown in Figure 2.7. 

Reynolds number (??), mentioned in Equation (2.3), is an essential parameter used on this 

thesis for dynamic similarity between the full-scale AUV prototype and hull model used for this 

study. To assume similar flow conditions, applied on this case, the Reynolds number needs to 

be the same for both scales i.e. Reynold’s law must be ensured (the inertial and frictional 

forces are present). For a constant kinematic viscosity (?), the smaller the models mean the 

higher speed, and forces do not scale down for constant viscosity. However, this similarity is 



Chapter 2 • Literature Review and Significant Theory  General Design of an AUV 

 17 

only valid when fluid properties of both scales are the same. Due to Reynolds number appears 

in RANS equations, it has an effect on all flows governed by these equations. Reynolds Number 

(hereinafter, Reynolds Number is going to referred as Re) is defined by the ratio of the fluid’s 

inertia forces to the viscous forces in the boundary layer of the fluid and it is given by the 

Equation (2.5), 

 ?? =  
?. ?
?
?

 (2.5) 

Where ? is absolute viscosity and ? the characteristic linear dimension. The denominator is also 

known as (Equation (2.6)), 

 ? =  
?

?
 (2.6) 

Consecutively, the Reynold’s similarity is represented by the Equations (2.7) and (2.8), 

 (??)? =  (??)? (2.7) 

 

 ?? =  ??. (
??
??

) (2.8) 

Where the subscript M represents Model and P the full-scale Prototype. 

Since ?? appears in several applications, ? represents one of many length scales. The transition 

point (point which the boundary layer changes from laminar to turbulent) is dependent of ?? 

i.e. as Re increases, this point moves forward on the surface [26]–[29]. 

 Another parameter which influences resistance of the streamlined body is the prismatic 

coefficient (??), that describes the amount of volume on the ends of the body. It is formed as 

“the ratio of the displaced volume with that contained in a prism formed by the mid-ship cross-

sectional area and the length”[30]. An optimum ?? value is around 0.6 [25], [31]. The ?? is 

defined as (Equation (2.9)): 

 ?? =  
?

?
4

 .  ?2  . ?
 (2.9) 

Where ? is the volume of the envelope, ? the maximum hull diameter and ? the body’s length. 

According to Joubert [30], reducing both L/D ratio and ?? “should give a reduction in total 

resistance coefficient of over eight percent.”.

Figure 2.7 – Resistance force components for a streamlined body with constant volume in an 

infinite fluid domain at constant velocity (adapted from [25]). 

The viscous pressure drag varies along the body’s surface, being its biggest value at the nose 

(called stagnation point), where the streamlines divide through the body. The pressure is 

smaller when the streamlines are straight, and rises when are diverging. In an ideal fluid (fluid 

with no viscosity), the nose and tail pressure would be the same i.e. the integral of all pressures 

acting on the body’s surface would be zero [25], [31]. 

However, in a real fluid, the viscosity is an important property that causes tangential force or 

friction resistance. This phenomenon occurs due to the interaction between the fluid and the 

body, and the formation of a fluid boundary layer around the body’s surface. The boundary 

layer depends on the relative velocity, location along the body’s length and the effects of local 

pressure gradients. The flow along the boundary layer can be either laminar or turbulent with 

a transitional region dividing the two [25], [31]. A detailed description of boundary layer is 

presented by [32], [33]. 

2.4.2 Hull Shape 

According to the given backgrounds above, it is extremely important to choose the most 

efficient hull shape in order to get the lowest drag possible.  

Mainly, two types of axisymmetric bodies were considered, these seem to be admitted by all 

authors with similar studies [8], [24], [34], [35]. These bodies are shown in Figure 2.8. A round 

hull presents no stress concentrations and when compared to other shapes is able to withstand 

more pressure, except for the spherical form. The spherical form is not considered on this 

study, even though being the most effective hydrodynamic shape. There are some aspects as 

strength, maneuverability, form resistance (L/D ratio = 1), propulsive efficiency or power 

housing requirements that makes this form an unfeasible option [36].

Figure 2.8 - Axisymmetric hull shapes (adapted from [31]). 

On Figure 2.8 (a) the shape presented is, known as the teardrop shape, this is the most ideal 

shape for submerged mode. Although, due to several issues on its construction and power 

housing requirements, the most conventional and applied form on AUV’s is the parallel mid-

body form (Figure 2.8 (b)). The nose and tail form, can be elliptical, conical or even parabolic. 

2.4.3 Restrictions to the flow around the model 

Depending on the model’s and tank size, there are some differences when an AUV model is 

towed in a towing tank or in the unrestricted water. These differences are usually referred to 

as the boundary effects. It may be classified into Wall Effect, Free surface effect and Blockage 

Effect [37]. 

The blockage ratio is defined as “the ratio of the maximum cross sectional area of the model 

to that of the towing tank.” [37]. Following this definition, the Blockage ratio is given by the 

Equation (2.10), 

 ?? =
?

??
 (2.10) 

Where ? is the maximum cross sectional area of the model and ?? the maximum cross sectional 

area of the towing tank. 

Wall Effect only depends on tank’s width. A combination of limited width and depth is known 

as the Blockage Effect. This phenomenon is rather complex due to the interference of the tank 

sides and bottom i.e. model size has to be sufficiently small to avoid inherent hydrodynamic 

interference, and this is called reflected wave interference effects. Unfortunately, a model 

too small leads to additional inaccuracies on the quality of results obtained due to the similarity 

between the full scale prototype and the model test [37]. As a result, the largest model with 



General Design of an AUV  Chapter 2 • Literature Review and Significant 
Theory 

 20 

minimum interference induced must be found. During the last years, the International Towing 

Tank Conference (ITTC) [38] made a recommendation for finding a blockage correction, 

although there is a lack of literature available. The blockage ratio is the most important 

parameter of the blockage effect. Marine Renewables Infrastructure Networks (MARINET) [39] 

refer blockage ratio above 0.1 can introduce questionable results, whereas H.Kim and J.Moss 

[37] present a lower limit of blockage ratio below which the blockage effect has normally been 

considered to be insignificant is 0.006. However, MARINET also refer cases which wave making 

is small, could be used larger models with the appropriate correction for the remaining blockage 

effect [37], [39], [40]. 

As described previously, AUV’s have two modes of navigation: surfaced mode and submerged 

mode. In surface mode, the wave resistance (divided into two components: wave breaking and 

wave making) is a main part of resistance (up to 50%) of total resistance. Although, this thesis 

is only based on the submerged mode, however, to travel under water, it is important to know 

at which depth is the interference of free surface negligible i.e. the wave resistance is minimum 

and can be neglected [24], [35]. There are several studies to find this fully submerged 

condition. 

Hoerner and Weinblum et al. [25] concluded that for submergence depth-to-diameter ratios of 

at least 5 (H* = 5.00) the wave resistance could be neglected, where H* is defined as (Equation 

(2.11), 

 ?? =

 (2.11) 

Being ? the submergence depth of an axisymmetric body’s longitudinal centerline below the 

still waterline and ? the maximum diameter. 

There are other authors that connected the fully submerged depth with maximum diameter or 

length of submersible hull. According to Moonesun et al. [24] several authors used different 

submerged depths for their studies as, ? = ?/2, ? = 3? or ? = 5?. Figure 2.9 shows the effect 

of the submergence depth on Drag Coefficient.

Moreover, Moonesun et al. [24] compares this submergence depth with Froude number (??) and 

concludes that it is an important parameter in the evaluation of submergence depth. Also 

concludes that exists one “Milestone depth” where wave resistance decreases more than 80% 

and other where there is no wave resistance called “Fully submerged depth”, as shown by the 

references above and as can be seen in Figure 2.10. Further, this author refers the “fully 

submerged depth for high Froude numbers is equal to 4.5D.” and the “milestone depth for high 

Froude numbers is equal to 0.125L.”. Moonesun et al. [24] presented the Froude number as a 

crucial parameter to study submergence depth, showing that for ?? &amp;lt;0.5 were considered 

ordinary values and for ?? &gt; 0.7 high values. These statements are supported by Figure 2.10. 

The Froude number appears in two-phase flow conditions (problems involving pressure 

boundary conditions) and it is only important for determining which depth there is no wave 

resistance. Since this thesis focus on one-phase flow condition, Froude number is only helpful 

to comprehend which depth is the fully submerged condition i.e. this means that if there is no 

free surface, this parameter is insignificant, as well as Weber and cavitation number 

(insignificant numbers for this thesis) [26], [28]. ?? is given by the Equation (2.12).

2.5 Fluid Mechanics Foundations 

Before examining the methods of Computational Fluid Dynamics, a review of the governing 

equations of fluid mechanics must be done. 

The fluid is defined by the ratio of specific heats (?), viscosity (?) and the coefficient of heat 

conduction (?). The motion of the fluid is controlled by governing equations and boundary 

conditions. Based on conservation laws, the governing equations of fluid mechanics are given 

by: 

- Mass conservation equation or continuity equation (mass can be neither created nor 

destroyed); 

- Momentum conservation equation (Newton’s 2nd Law); 

- Energy conservation equation (based on the 1st law of Thermodynamics). 

All details of these equations (considerations and forms) are fully described at references [41], 

[42]. Hence, only the final equations will be demonstrated. 

The conservation of mass can be described as the net outflow of mass through the surface 

surrounding the volume has to equal to the time rate of decrease of mass inside control volume. 

The differential form of continuity equation (vector form) is given by the Equation (2.13): 

 
??

??

Where ? is the time, ? is fluid velocity vector (?, ?, w) and 
?

??

+ ? . ? is the material 

derivative that represents the rate of change following a fluid particle [43], [44].

 23 

The momentum conservation equation, based on Newton’s 2nd law of motion, is represented by 

the Equation (2.14), which represents the net force action on a system has to be equal to the 

time rate of change of momentum of system.

Where ?? is the component of the mass force per unit mass second in the ? direction, ???  are the 

stress components, and ?, ? = (1,2,3), i.e. a matrix 3x3 of stress components. Assuming a 

Newtonian fluid (where the stress components are linear to the derivatives), a relation between 

velocity filed and stress components can be made, as shown in Equation (2.15) [44].

Where ? is the viscosity coefficient, ???  is the Kronecker delta function, ? is the pressure and ? 

a dummy variable summed from 1 to 3. Replacing the stress components of Equation (2.15) into 

the Equation (2.14), the Navier-Stokes equations are achieved, as demonstrated in Equation 

(2.16).

Finally, to complete the system of equations comes the energy conservation equation, which 

states the 1st Law of Thermodynamics: “The sum of the work and heat added to a system will 

equal the increase of energy.”[45]. There are several forms of this equation in literature, the 

Equation (2.17) is one of these forms.

Where ? is the coefficient of thermal conductivity, ? is the internal energy per unit mass, ? is

and ????w =  ??? the work done on the system [46]. 

2.6 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) – Numerical Approach 

The behavior of viscous fluid flow is described by Navier-Stokes Equations (Equation (2.16)). 

Fluid flow, in of the majority of the cases, is turbulent. Turbulent flows have as particular 

characteristic: transportation of quantities, as momentum, energy, and species concentration, 

with fluctuation (hardest case to solve, small scale and high frequency) [47], [48]. These 

complex equations need to be solved numerically by the use of computational methods, except 

for very simple cases. All of these computational, theoretical and numerical methods are known 

as Computational Fluid Dynamics.  



Turbulence models  Chapter 2 • Literature Review and Significant 
Theory 

 24 

The computational fluid mechanics techniques use the Eulerian approach to solve all 

applications. However, Navier-Stokes equations varies with time, which denotes that is 

required averaging multiple solutions at a set of time steps [49]. This leads to a decomposition 

of Navier-Stokes equation into the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. 

Furthermore, RANS equations introduces to a several unknowns (Reynolds stress) that requires 

a turbulence model to generate a closed system of solvable equations, i.e. turbulence model 

is used to close the system of mean flow equations [49].  

RANS equations are the most widely used approach, although there are other approaches that 

can simulate with higher precision, as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct Numerical 

Simulation (DNS). LES solves the spatially averaged RANS equations, directly resolving larger 

eddies, but modelling small ones. However, due to the computational requirements it is not a 

feasible option. DNS solves the full RANS equations, simulating with accuracy all turbulent flows 

(all eddies included) without requiring turbulence models. However, this approach is not 

practical for engineering purposes, due to extremely high costs and computational resources 

required [50]. A more detailed study about this topic can be made by checking of references 

[29], [31], [42], [51] . 

2.7 Turbulence models 

Since this study comprises the use of a well-known commercial software called ANSYS FLUENT, 

it will be described the turbulence models related to this tool. 

Therefore, the turbulent models provided by ANSYS FLUENT are: 

- Spalart-Allmaras model (one-equation model); 

- ?-? models (two-equation model) 

- Standard ?-? model; 

o Renormalization-group (RNG) ?-? model; 

o Realizable ?-? model. 

- ?-? models (two-equation model) 

o Standard ?-? model; 

o Shear-stress transport (SST) ?-? model. 

- Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) (seven-equation model); 

- Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model. 

It is important to understand “that no single turbulence model is universally accepted as being 

superior for all classes of problems” [50]. So, depending on purpose/necessity and 

computational resources/time efficiency the choice of turbulence model should be made. 

Following this procedure and the ideas reached by literature review, two models will be 

described. These turbulence models are: Standard ?-? and ?-? SST models. A detailed 

information about these models or other turbulence models are fully presented in [42], [50].

 25 

2.7.1 Standard ?-? model 

This is the most used turbulence model in engineering for industrial applications. It is known as 

being robust, economic and with a satisfactory accuracy for turbulent flows. As referred above 

this is a two-equation model, which allows to calculate the turbulent length and time scale by 

solving two transport equations. These equations are for turbulence kinetic energy (?) and 

dissipation rate (?). A limitation of this turbulent model is that it is only valid for fully turbulent 

flows. Further, at near-wall regions, wall functions must be used, due to ? equation. Although, 

several improvements were implemented on Standard ?-? model, resulting in examples as ?-? 

RNG model or ?-? Realizable model, but as referred previously, a trade-off of 

purpose/computational resources should be made before choosing a turbulent model [48]. 

2.7.2 ?-? SST model 

This turbulence model is considered an “upgrade” of Standard ?-?. Furthermore, it was 

developed to have the benefits of ?-? model (near-wall region) and ?-? model (freestream 

independence in the far field). The ? equation integrates a damped cross-diffusion derivative 

term. The consideration of the transport effects of the principal turbulent shear stress led to a 

modified turbulent viscosity formulation [42], [50]. 

2.8 Similar studies 

Mansoorzadeh and Javanmard [52] presented the free surface effect on drag and lift 

coefficients of an AUV by comparing two-phase flow numerical simulation with single phase 

flow simulation and the experimental procedure. The study was performed at several 

submergence depths for 1.5 and 2.5 m/s. The study demonstrated that, for both AUV speeds, 

the influence of free surface on drag coefficient was decreasing as the model distance from 

the free surface was increasing. A maximum difference of 10% between the numerical and 

experimental results for drag coefficient was observed. These authors concluded that it is not 

very straightforward to compare which method is more accurate, since there are errors and 

uncertainties associated with each one. Although, collecting data from both methods and 

compare them seemed to conclude better results.  

J.L.D. Dantas and E.A. de Barros [11] investigated the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients 

obtained by an AUV with control surface deflection and angle of attack by the use of CFD 

software based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. These authors 

conducted their CFD simulations separately (AUV bare hull and control surface), to better 

predict each interference and compare with experimental results obtained in a towing tank. 

They concluded that the k-? SST turbulent model was the best model to predict hydrodynamic 

coefficients and the nonlinear regression methodology is the best choice for predicting the stall 

at control surface.

For these experimental results done by J.L.D Dantas and E.A. de Barros [11], Lucas et al. [53] 

used strain gauge type dynamometers to measure hydrodynamic efforts of an AUV with the 

same external geometry used by Maya AUV, with a diameter of 0.234 m and a total length of 

1.742 m, at a longitudinal velocity of 1 m/s. In order to measure hydrodynamic forces and 

moments, experiments were made for each sideslip angle, adopting some struts configurations 

to reduce its influence in results (Drag and hydrodynamic effects). Experiments indicated, in 

the normal force case, an insignificant difference using the fairing structure. The results are 

shown in Figure 2.11 with a comparison of the results obtained by other author (Jorgensen) 

with similar study [8]. Furthermore, De Barros, Dantas, Pascoal and De Sá [54] used some of 

these results to create a new application methodology of semi-empirical prediction models.

moment (c) between towing tank results and Jorgensen results (adapted from [8]). 

Praveen P.C. and Krishnankutty P. [34] studied the hydrodynamic forces of axisymmetric UUV’s 

by varying vehicle’s length due to angle of attack, for a bare hull configuration, by performing 

Vertical Planar Motion Mechanism (VPMM) experimental tests, using CFD code FLUENT 6.2. for 

numerical simulations and doing the same Analytical and Semi-Empirical (ASE) method that De 

Barros, Dantas, Pascoal and De Sá used [54]. Their numerical and experimental results were 

converging and the empirical method seemed to be very good to predict linear coefficients. 

Results show that the linear coefficients vary linearly with L/D. 

P.Jagadeesh and K.Murali [55] studied four low Reynolds number k-? models to predicting the 

hydrodynamic forces of AUV’s. These authors demonstrated that the k-? Abe-Nagano-Kondoh 

(AKN) turbulent model revealed to predict more closely the flow separation and wake formation 

in comparison to the other models considered. This turbulent model has also shown a better 

hydrodynamic coefficients prediction when compared with other models.

P.Jagadeesh, K.Murali and V.G.Idichandy [56] performed an experimental study on 

hydrodynamic forces and moments of an AUV model in the vertical plane to observe its variation 

with Reynolds number and angle of attack. To validate these results, CFD ANSYS FLUENT with 

RANS equations was used. Using the Froude scaling, a model scale ratio was selected. The 

turbulence model k-? AKN showed to be a good option for predicting hydrodynamic forces and 

coefficients of AUV’s. It was also shown that there was a maximum increase in normal force 

coefficient compared to axial force coefficient under the same conditions (velocity and angle 

of attack). Equally, for the pitching moment, lift and drag coefficients there is an increase of 

these values.  

Alam, Ray and Anavatti [57] presented empirical and numerical (CFD ANSYS FLUENT 13.0.) 

methods to estimate the drag of an AUV. The range of flow speed varied from 0.5 to 3.0 m/s, 

with a range of Reynolds number of 6.5 x 105 to 3.89 x 106. The turbulent model used by authors 

was the realizable k-? model with enhanced wall treatment. Results show good agreement with 

empirical estimation, although drag differences between the empirical and CFD results increase 

at high velocities (10.80% at a flow speed of 3.0 m/s). 

Moonesun, Javadi, Charmdooz and Mikahailovich [35] presented a detailed experimental 

procedure to test a model scale ratio of 1:32 of the prototype vehicle. Since the scale was too 

high, Reynolds number similarity was unfeasible. Therefore, the authors adopted four other 

methods for scaling, found depth which there is no free surface effects (five times the model’s 

diameter) and a CFD simulation was made to compare. To predict which was the best method, 

authors made a comparison between model tests and the other five tests (four empirical 

estimations and one numerical simulation). CFD simulation showed the best results for hull and 

appendages analyses (10% of error at a speed of 12 knots). 

Kunz et al. [58] conducted an expedition called the Artic GAkkel Vents Expedition (AGAVE) to 

further investigate marine biology, chemistry and geology associated with hydrothermal venting 

at Gakkel Ridge. Two AUV’s (Jaguar and Puma), differing only in their sensor payload, were 

designed to perform the task of collecting images and samples of the deep seafloor. These 

AUV’s are based on Seabed design and performed a total of nine dives at depths of up to 4062 

m. Authors concluded that “the fundamental requirement for reliable acoustic communications 

should be taken as a starting point for future development of sub-ice vehicles.”. 

In fact, this is not directly connected to the topic of this thesis. However, the AUV’s (Jaguar 

and Puma) geometries are similar to the prototype that this thesis is based on. Consequently, 

it is pertinent to highlight a similar project and its mission; it can be seen as a guide.

3 Case Study 

It is aimed to optimize the hydrodynamics of a single-hull body considered as representative of 

MEDUSA Deep-Sea lower-hull, in order to optimize the external vehicle shape for the operation 

conditions. Furthermore, an optimized external vehicle shape produces lower Drag force, which 

reduces the energy consumption of the vehicle, and consequently increases its autonomy.  As 

well as MEDUSA Deep-Sea, the single-hull prototype is considered to operate in depths up to 

3000 m in ocean (salt water), i.e. resist to a pressure of at least 300 atm. Vehicle should also 

hold Temperatures up to a minimum of 0?C. 

3.1 Requirements 

The prototype is also considered to operate in velocities between 0 and 3 m/s, with a nominal 

operation velocity of 1.5 m/s. Moreover, operating at its nominal operation velocity, the 

vehicle should not sustain operations at AoA’s higher than 20?, being its nominal cruise 

operation at 0?. These operation conditions are represented in Table 3.1.

3.2 Dimensions and Shape 

Throughout systems, structural and stability constraints, the dimensions of the single hull body 

considered as representative of prototype’s hull were defined. These considered dimensions 

were:  centre section diameter of 0.340 m and a length of 1.5 m.  

According to the literature review and respecting the given design constraints, the most 

appropriate shape for the centre section is the cylindrical shape. In order to improve the 

hydrodynamics, nose and tail hydrodynamic fairings were included. These nose and tail sections 

were studied to understand which shape specifically should be used. This study includes the 

elliptical and conical shapes for the nose and tail fairings. However, the properly nose and tail 

length must be also found to fully optimize the hull prototype. Classification of the tail and

4 Experimental Study 
In this Chapter, the experimental procedure will be fully detailed, including the several 

considerations and steps made. Further, the results of the experimental tests will be shown, 

demonstrating the tendencies obtained from the data collection. 

4.1 Experimental Model Design 

4.1.1 Dimensions 

Due to towing tank size (see Table 4.1), a full-scale single-hull model was an unfeasible option. 

Therefore, the first consideration taken to Model’s Design was to find an optimum trade-off 

between model’s and tank size, i.e. higher Model length can induce to Wall and Surface effects, 

and smaller Model length can induce to scale error effects (associated with scale ratio). Thus, 

a LTOTAL/D ratio = 10 was defined as starting Design point. According to the authors referred 

above, finding the largest model without wall and free surface interference must be a focus. 

Following these authors and knowing the size of the tank (Table 4.1), the depth for fully 

submerged condition has been calculated, as shown on the Tables (Table 4.2 &amp;amp; Table 4.3) 

below. The difference between the Tables is only considering the diameter while measuring 

the h, i.e. considering h from the hull’s surface or body’s longitudinal centerline.

As shown above, the main difference between TablesTable 4.2 andTable 4.3 lies in the depth 

h (400 or 400-D/2). The author selected these dimensions, due to towing tank size (height and 

width middle point). At this point, h, the influence of both side walls is the same and the author 

assumed the same influence on tank’s surface and bottom. In fact, the influence of water’s 

surface and bottom tank wall is not the same, but according to literature review (Froude 

number, submergence depth and blockage ratio) and to the towing tank restrictions seemed to 

be the most feasible option. Thus, according to the literature review [24], at least H* = 3 must 

be respected for a fully submerged depth. The author preferred to follow the second Table 

(Table 4.2), in order to get the largest model. The columns marked as light grey, were the 

conditions chosen to follow. In this case, it is relevant to understand that the h = L/2 and h = 

5D have the same results. The only difference between each condition is the point where the 

calculation starts i.e. for L/2 the first step is to find the total length and for 5D is to find the 

maximum diameter. Therefore, the largest model and a fully submerged depth were found to 

be respecting all the conditions referred above. A smaller model could be used to do the 

experiments, like for example the h = 6D calculated by the author. However, the smaller the 

model, the bigger the errors associated with scaling process. Thus, to guarantee Reynold’s 

similarity, a smaller model needs to achieve a bigger velocity as shown by Equation (2.5). 

As it will be shown in the Experimental Setup, the tank’s depth is not always constant. However, 

several procedures were made to guarantee the data collection at the location which has the 

desired tank depth (800 mm). 

Applying the Equation (2.10) on this study, the blockage ratio is given by the Equation (4.1), 

 
(80 . 80)

(800 . 800)
= 0.01 = ?? (4.1) 

The author uses a blockage ratio of 0.01, for low Froude numbers (always smaller than 0.7) and 

small wave making as will be shown later. Therefore, the blockage effect has no influence on 

results or it is too small that will be ignored [39]. 

In order to optimize the AUV model, various experimental conditions were defined, after the 

restrictions found due to the towing tank size, with different nose and tail ratios to find the 

optimum configuration. Based upon the premise of Figure 3.1 and Table 4.2, all Lengths (Nose, 

mid-body and Tail) were calculated. Thus, ratios were discussed and defined to have a logical 

manner of evaluate the body’s model, keeping constant the mid-body’s diameter and length, 

varying only the Nose and Tail lengths. Adapting the full-scale case from Figure 3.1 to the AUV 

model, due to all restrictions, the hull’s dimensions and ratios were calculated, as can be shown 

in Figure 4.1.

4.1.2 Prototype Design &amp;amp; Manufacturing  

In this section is demonstrated the process of model’s design and crucial considerations adopted 

until its manufacturing. Besides the design of the AUV model, helpful tools were also designed 

to adapt and get easier to the experiments. Thus, this section can be known as the starting 

point for the Experimental Setup that will be described later on this Chapter. 

 The software used to design this experimental procedure was the CATIA V5R24 powered by 

Dassault Systèmes [59]. CEiiA provided the use of this commercial software. 

It is important to denote that due to several manufacturing limitations, some geometrical 

precautions were taken such as curvature coefficient of nose and tail, and the production of a 

perfect conical edge was extremely difficulty to manufacture, leading to a few design 

adjustments.  

In order to optimize the experimental procedure, all connections were screwed to simplify the 

process, as can be shown in Figure 4.2. In order to connect the AUV to the trolley’s towing tank 

a detailed study was made. The holes observed on body’s top connect the body to a towing 

tank carriage. Figure 4.3 shows an isometric view of the experimental design.

Figure 4.3 - Experimental configuration. 

The AoA system (Figure 4.3 - Point 5) was designed to ensure a proposed angle of attack. In this 

experimental case, three AoA were desired to do the experiments, as previously shown.  These 

three AoA are shown in Figure 4.4.

Figure 4.5 shows a final arrangement of all the components manufactured with respect to 

Experimental procedure. However, Figure 4.5 do not include all noses and tails, only a complete 

experimental configuration. As can be shown, a pair of fairings were designed to reduce the 

resistance force generated by the struts.

Figure 4.5 - Experimental manufactured components.  

The associated Images of the final prototype after all the manufacturing processes are 

presented in Appendix A. Several different materials were used for this process. All components 

involving the AUV model (nose, body and tail) and struts were constructed using aluminum 2030 

by machining process (Computer Numeric Control (CNC)). Fairings were developed by an 

additive manufacturing technology called Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) using Polyamide. The 

metallic structure that holds the struts was created by bending process using steel. 

4.2 Experimental Setup 

On this section, the author gives the relevant information about every milestone relative to the 

Experimental Setup. 

The experiments were conducted in a towing tank at UBI’s Hydraulic Laboratory. Knowing that 

running the experiments with ocean salt water was not possible, the towing tank was filled 

with fresh water taken from a waterhole by the use of a water pump. The water properties are 

shown in Table 4.4. Further, the towing tank dimensions considered are also shown in Table 

4.4. The towing tank depth is not constant along the tank, being also 0.5 m depth in some 

sections, as shown in Figure 4.6. Nevertheless, the author considered only the section of 0.8 m 

depth for present studies, since the towing carriage needs a section to increase its velocity 

until reaching the desired velocity, and a section to decrease its velocity until it fully stops. 

Due to a few towing tank irregularities it was also observed that this section which the depth 

is 0.8 m was the most reliable zone of the towing tank for data collection. Images of the real 

experimental layout are shown in Appendix B.

Figure 4.6 - Experimental laboratory layout. 

Attending to the conditions imposed, exhibited in Table 4.5, the author encountered a major 

problem to solve, since the towing tank had no system to automatically tow the carriage by a 

given velocity. Thus, changes should be made to have a system for data collection. To settle 

this issue, the towing tank was adapted after several considerations. The design of full 

operational experimental layout is shown in Figure 4.7.

Figure 4.7 - Full experimental design. 

The Load Cell (Dynamometer), showed in Figure 4.7, was used to estimate the total resistance 

force of the towing carriage. It was connected to the carriage and to an iron thread which was 

pulling the carriage driven by a motor. However, this three-phase motor used was not directly 

controllable, so a frequency inverter was used to control motor velocity. So, before starting 

any Experimental Test, a long construction process was undertaken. Some steps can be 

observed in Appendix C. 

The materials successfully added to the experimental setup are listed below: 

- Load cell MAX LOAD 1 ton; 



Experimental Setup  Chapter 4 • Experimental Study 

 38 

- Three-phase motor 0.75 kiloWatt (kW) (1 horsepower (hp)); 

- OMRON V1000 50 Hertz (Hz) frequency inverter; 

- Pair of polies taken from a Toyota Carina engine; 

- Iron thread; 

- Toothed belt; 

- Aluminum (base is fully made of this material); 

- Sheave; 

- Solid aluminum rod; 

- Iron tube (bobbin); 

- Pair of bearings; 

- Wood disks; 

- Metallic disks; 

- Circuit breaker. 

To get the final and desired prototype some processes had to be used, such as: 

- Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding; 

- Arc welding; 

- Grinding machine; 

- Mechanically powered saw; 

- Turning machine; 

- Laser cutting machine; 

- Spray painting. 

As any Experimental Procedure, this one was also made by attempts. The author made many 

design changes, changed several specific materials and tried to solve the problems that 

appeared along the way. In Appendix C a few different components from the final product can 

be observed (as different three-phase motor or bobbin), since in a project design there are 

always changes. The Figure 4.8 shows the final prototype ready to be assembled to the towing 

tank walls.

Figure 4.8 - Final metallic structure assembled before mounting at the towing tank. 

The author also made the electric connections between the three-phase motor and the 

frequency inverter. The cable was inserted in the white connector, observed in Figure 4.8, and 

then the three-phase connection on both components were made; the three phases should work 

in sequence, otherwise the three-phase motor would not work. The frequency inverter is also 

shown in Appendix D. Figure 4.9 showing the point which the Experiments started. Further, a 

few adjustments in the towing tank were also executed, as the use of a caulking gun to fully 

close the gate and rails correction. 

 

Figure 4.9 - Final Experimental Setup. 

To optimize the Experiments (time and difficulty) an automated returning system, i.e. a system 

which allowed the towing carriage to go back autonomously to the starting position, was 

developed. A Figure of this “returning system” is shown in Appendix C. This system simplified 

the Experimental Procedure, since without it a run would take three times longer than it did.  



Experimental Setup  Chapter 4 • Experimental Study 

 40 

There are also several considerations made by the author during the Experiments. Each of this 

Experiments consists of: a stationary phase (initial position); an accelerating phase until 

reaching the desired velocity and then remains constant for data collection; and a decelerating 

phase until the carriage stops in a safety mode (final position). In fact, data collection was 

made along the entire run and only after data analyzing the desired range was selected. 

Although, these Experiments depend on various factors during each data collection 

(instruments, stationary water, initial and final position, dynamometer precision and others), 

i.e. there is an uncertainty value associated in the resistance force during each data collection. 

Therefore, the ITTC [60] described the importance of repeat measurements at least 10 times 

for each specific combinations as a better measure of uncertainty. Based on this, the author 

defined that 10 samples should be measured for each combination. 

4.2.1 Data Collection 

A load cell was used to measure the resistance force. This load cell, with a maximum load of 1 

ton, is a force transducer for the measurement of static and dynamic loads in compression and 

tension. This equipment, was manufactured by AEP transducers and provided by CEiiA. For data 

collection a WIMOD transmitter and WISTAR receiver were used. The WIMOD transmitter, 

applied on the body of the load cell, through a wireless communication integrated interface 

with WISTAR receiver, shown in Appendix D. This receiver had a DATALOGGER option which 

allows to memorize measurements and to keep them in the internal memory. WIMOD can also 

communicate directly in real time to a Personal Computer (PC) which uses a software for instant 

data collection. However, this faster process was unavailable. So, for data collection the 

DATALOGGER option was used. The WISTAR was configured accordingly the needs (recording 

time, transmission frequency, bound rate and time between each communication). Further, 

since the calibration of these instruments is done periodically, the author only set zero at the 

desired position (initial position). This equipment had an improved uncertainty from 0.005% to 

0.02% [61].  

4.2.2 Weight difference 

A study of weight difference between all combinations was made before the Experimental 

Tests. After some testing runs, it was revealed that this study was also important and had 

influence on the results due to the friction force between the wheels and the rails, which 

depends on the weight of the towing carriage (trolley, assembly and model test). This study 

consisted in: measuring the Volume (V) of all the body’s components precisely using CATIA 

V5R24 software; use the Archimedes’ Principle (“indicates that the upward buoyancy force that 

is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the 

weight of the fluid that the body displaces” [62]) to calculate the Buoyancy (B) of each 

component (shown in Table 4.6 &amp;amp; Table 4.7) and define the heaviest combination as standard 

(Table 4.8); calculate the difference between the standard (heaviest) combination and each 



Chapter 4 • Experimental Study  Experimental Setup 

 41 

other; and get an approximation of weight necessary to be added for each combination (Table 

4.9).

As shown on Table 4.6 to Table 4.9, some combinations have the same weight. Thus, the author 

organized the combinations into Groups. Since it was not possible to add the exact value of 

load, the author also made an estimation about the error using an approximation of adding 

load. The maximum value for this error is 2.4% (Table 4.9), which has negligible influence. 

Images of this consideration are shown in Appendix E. 

4.2.3 Drag Calculation 

As shown before, the model was connected to the metallic structure (attached to the towing 

tank) through two struts covered by fairings. However, the load cell was connected to the 

towing carriage, measuring the total resistance force of all sets. In order to measure only the 

AUV’s resistance force, the method adopted was the same of Mansoorzadeh and Javanmard  

[52] adopted for their experiment. The method is to measure only the resistance force of towing 

carriage with the metallic structure and struts attached. Then, measure the resistance force 

of all components (towing carriage, metallic structure, struts and AUV model). Finally, 

subtracting these two processes, the AUV’s resistance force could be calculated. The method 

implemented for Drag estimation is shown in Figure 4.10.

Figure 4.10 – Procedure adopted to calculate the Drag caused, exclusively, by the hull body. 

4.2.4 Frequency inverter study / Velocity estimation 

On this section, considerations to estimate the AUV’s velocity will be detailed. As will be shown 

here, the velocity is directly linked with the frequency inverter, i.e. the frequency inverter 

controls the three-phase motor frequency.  

As described previously, the frequency inverter can operate up to 50 Hz. The methodology 

adopted to find the velocity in which the AUV model was travelling was: Define a known 

distance to measure the time which AUV model takes to run; save that time and frequency; 

using the Equation (4.2) calculate the velocity; and repeat this process until discover the 

maximum velocity desired. 

 ? =  
?

?
 (4.2) 

Where ? is the velocity, ? the distance traveled in meters (m) and ? the time in seconds (?). 

The Table 4.10 demonstrates all these considerations above referred.

The distance measured was 4.48 m, located at the mid-section of the towing tank. The time 

collection was repeated five times for each case, in order to obtain a more reliable time. The 

Frequency tested was between 1 and 20 Hz. However, a frequency lower than 4 Hz had no 

sufficient Torque to pull the towing carriage. It was also verified that for frequencies above 18 

Hz the towing carriage could not stop in a safety mode. The velocities and frequencies chosen 

are marked in Table 4.10.  

Froude number verification according velocities 

Once the velocities were defined, the Froude number verification is important to understand 

which condition should be respected for fully submerged condition, according to the Figure 

2.10. 

Following the Equation (2.12), the Froude number for maximum length combination (800mm) 

and for 0.5, 0.75 and 1.00 m/s are given, respectively, by (Equation (4.3), (4.4) and (4.5)),

4.3 Experimental Tests Results 

After all considerations referred above, the Experimental Tests were performed. However, due 

to some technical issues, it was not possible to run all combinations. Thus, at least eleven from 

eighteen combinations were performed (around 1100 test). In order to achieve the optimum 

configuration and its conditions, several studies were done and will be shown below. The author 

opted to look for a trend between the results, since there are a considerable number of them. 

These results are structured in a coherent manner: find the optimum configuration for each 

tail shape, compare them between each other, and finally demonstrate a detailed study of the 

optimum configuration. Should be noted that by the lack of some results, including results for 

the biggest nose (N/D = 2.4), it was not possible to display results for this ratio. 

4.3.1 Length Optimization (Conical Tail) 

For this Conical Tail study, two steps were considered in order to find the effect of AoA and 

Velocity, on Drag. These steps include the nominal AoA and velocity for this AUV model. The 

first step is: by fixing the AoA at 0 degrees, finding the optimum nose and tail configuration. 

Consecutively, the second one is: by fixing the velocity at 1 m/s, finding the optimum nose and 

tail configuration. 

Influence of Nose length on Drag for nominal AoA (0 degrees) 

Fixing the AoA at 0 degrees and T/D at 3.2, varying the N/D within a range of 0.8 to 1.6, Drag 

Results are shown in Chart 4.1:

Chart 4.1 – Drag Results for different velocities operating at 0 degrees, varying N/D between 

0.8 to 1.6, and fixing the T/D = 3.2. 

The Chart 4.1 demonstrates a trend of all velocities for the optimum N/D ratio at 0.8. It can 

be noted that Drag increases linearly with the increase of N/D ratios. Also, Drag increases 

whenever the velocity increase. There is a Drag difference between 0.75 and 1.00 m/s that is 

nearly the double compared with 0.50 and 0.75 m/s.

The Chart 4.2 presents an optimum T/D ratio at 1.6. For T/D = 1.6, the Drag difference between 

each velocity it is nearly close until T/D = 2.4. This Chart also denote higher Drag for higher 

velocities. Furthermore, Drag increases non-linear with T/D ratios.  

Influence of Nose length on Drag for nominal velocity (1 m/s) 

Fixing the velocity at 1 m/s and T/D at 3.2, varying the N/D within a range of 0.8 to 1.6, the 

Drag results are shown in Chart 4.3: 

 

Chart 4.3 - Drag Results for different AoA’s operating at 1 m/s, varying N/D between 0.8 to 

1.6, and fixing the T/D = 3.2. 

The Chart 4.3 shows that Drag increases with the increase of N/D ratio at 0 and 10 degrees, 

and between both. Further, for these AoA’s the optimum N/D ratio is 0.8. However, for an AoA 

of 20 degrees, the Drag decreases by increasing the N/D ratio. The optimum N/D ratio for this 

AoA is 1.6. This occurrence can be justified with the experimental error associated with high 

velocities, AoA’s and for bigger lengths (high N/D ratio, in this case). AUV model operating 

under these conditions might bring into consideration the Wall and Surface effects, albeit 

dimensions are being respected according literature review [24]. Globally, the optimum N/D 

ratio can be considered 0.8 (operating under nominal velocity the AUV should operate with low 

AoA’s). At this N/D ratio, the Drag value almost double up between 0 and 20 degrees. 

Influence of Tail length on Drag for nominal velocity (1 m/s)

Chart 4.4 - Drag Results for different AoA’s operating at 1 m/s, fixing N/D and varying the 

T/D between 1.6 to 3.2. 

The Chart 4.4 indicates an optimum T/D ratio of 1.6. At this T/D ratio, the Drag value almost 

double up between 0 and 20 degrees. For lower AoA’s the Drag almost remains constant for 

different T/D ratio. However, for an AoA of 20 degrees Drag has a considerable increase with 

the increase of T/D ratio.  

4.3.2 Length Optimization (Elliptical Tail) 

Following the same procedure applied for Conical Tail, a parallel Elliptical Tail study was made 

find the effect of AoA and Velocity on Drag, to finally compare both shapes later.

The Chart 4.6 demonstrates an optimum T/D ratio of 1.6. Drag increases with the increase of 

velocity. The Drag difference between the velocities 0.5 and 1 m/s are smaller with the 

increase of T/D ratio. Further, Drag also increases with the increase of T/D ratio.  

Influence of Nose length on Drag for nominal velocity (1 m/s) 

Fixing the velocity at 1 m/s and T/D at 3.2, varying the N/D within a range of 0.8 to 2.4, the 

Drag results are shown in Chart 4.7: 

 

Chart 4.7 - Drag Results for different AoA’s operating at 1 m/s, varying N/D between 0.8 to 

2.4, and fixing the T/D = 3.2. 

The Chart 4.7 denotes that Drag increases for AoA’s of 0 and 10 degrees. Furthermore, for these 

AoA’s the optimum N/D ratio is 0.8. However, for an AoA of 20 degrees, the Drag decreases by 

increasing the N/D ratio until N/D = 1.6, which is the optimum N/D ratio for this AoA, and 

increases hereafter. This behavior can be justified with the experimental error associated with 

high velocities, AoA’s and for bigger lengths. AUV model operating under these conditions might 

bring into consideration the Wall and Surface effects, as referred previously. Globally, the 

optimum N/D ratio can be considered 0.8 (operating under nominal velocity the AUV should 

operate with low AoA’s). At this N/D ratio, the Drag value almost double up between 0 and 20 

degrees of AoA.

Chart 4.8 - Drag Results for different AoA’s operating at 1 m/s, fixing N/D and varying T/D 

between 1.6 to 3.2 

The Chart 4.8 shows an optimum T/D ratio at 1.6. At nominal AoA (0 degrees), Drag increases 

linearly with the increase of T/D ratio. For bigger AoA’s, Drag increases with the increase of 

T/D until 2.4. Hereinafter, Drag has the trend to remain constant. 

4.3.3 Tendencies 

Analyzing the Charts presented above, there is clearly a common trend between both cases 

(Elliptical and Conical). However, it is not clear which of these cases is the optimum. Some 

conclusions should be made in order to compare them afterwards. 

For 0 degrees, a N/D ratio of 0.8 was the optimum value for both Conical and Elliptical tails. 

Further, Drag’s behavior in these cases, is almost the same (increases with regard to Velocity 

and AoA). 

For 0 degrees, a T/D ratio of 1.6 is clearly the optimum value for both tail shapes. Drag also 

increase with the increase of T/D ratios and Velocity. 

Relatively to the nominal velocity (1 m/s), both Charts (Chart 4.3 and Chart 4.7) (Elliptical and 

Conical, respectively) describe the same behavior until N/D = 1.6, showing that there is a trend 

between both combinations, being interesting to note the similar behavior of these Charts. N/D 

ratio of 0.8 seem to be the optimum value for both cases, although for an AoA of 20 degrees 

the optimum value is N/D = 1.6. Drag for N/D ratio of 0.8 almost doubles up for both cases, 

since 0 degrees to 20 degrees of AoA.

Finally, at the velocity of 1 m/s, the optimum T/D ratio is 1.6 for Elliptical and Conical (Chart 

4.4 and Chart 4.8, respectively) tails. In these cases, Drag has a similar behavior for 0 and 10 

degrees of AoA. Furthermore, for 20 degrees of AoA, the behavior is also similar until T/D ratio 

of 2.4. 

4.3.4 Comparison between optimum configurations 

After careful analysis, it has been concluded that for both cases the optimum configuration is 

N/D = 0.8 (elliptical nose) and T/D = 1.6 (elliptical and conical tail). Following the study, the 

optimum configuration between both cases should be found. The Chart 4.9 and Chart 4.10 

compare both cases, Conical and Elliptical to find the tail shape that produces lower Drag by 

varying AoA and Velocity, respectively. 

 

Chart 4.9 - Comparison of Drag Results between Conical and Elliptical tail shapes, for 

different AoA’s on a velocity of 1 m/s. FALTA LEGENDAR CORRECTAMENTE 

The Chart 4.9 shows the comparison between an Elliptical and Conical Tail shapes operating 

under the same conditions, i.e. operating at 1 m/s for different AoA’s (0-20?). Although tail 

shapes demonstrate a similar result, the Conical tail shape shows to be the geometry that 

produce lower Drag.

Chart 4.10 - Comparison between Elliptical and Conical tail shapes, for different velocities at 

0 degrees of AoA. 

The Chart 4.10 demonstrates the comparison between Elliptical and Conical tail shapes 

operating at different velocities on a fixed AoA (0 degrees). There are also similar results for 

both cases, but for nominal velocity (1 m/s) it is evident that Conical Tail shape shows to be 

the final optimum configuration. Therefore, based on these two comparisons showed, the 

author will focus on the optimum geometry for a more detailed study. 

4.3.5 Optimum Experimental Combination 

As described previously, a combination of an Elliptical nose with a N/D = 0.8 and a Conical tail 

with a T/D = 1.6 showed to be the optimum configuration. Thus, it will be showed Drag force 

and Coefficient variation with Velocity and AoA. The two following Charts (Chart 4.11 &amp;amp; Chart 

4.12) exhibit a study of Drag force and Coefficient, respectively, for the optimum combination.

Chart 4.12 - The influence of Velocity (0.5 – 1.00 m/s) on Drag, for different AoA’s (0 - 20?). 

Analyzing these two Charts (Chart 4.11 &amp;amp; Chart 4.12) represented above, it can be concluded 

that the Drag increases with Velocity and AoA. Relatively to nominal conditions (1 m/s and 0 

degrees), it can be also concluded that Drag is always minimum when operating at 0 degrees 

for all velocities. However, operating at 1 m/s, Drag is higher comparatively to lower velocities. 

There is an operating point that should be avoided, in which Drag reaches its maximum. This 

point is: Velocity = 1 m/s and AoA = 20?. Drag Coefficient increases with the increasing of AoA, 

and decreases with the increasing of velocity. Thus, can be concluded that the influence of AoA 

on Drag is higher for greater velocities.

5 Numerical Analysis 

This section demonstrates the steps and choices made, in order to validate the Numerical 

Simulation against the Experimental Procedure. This procedure embraces the Model’s 

dimensions intended to be studied initially, i.e. the hull’s dimensions applied for Numerical 

Simulation are shown in Figure 3.1. The CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 16.0 was used for this 

thesis to predict the hydrodynamic coefficients and forces. Thus, Numerical Results and 

conclusions about Numerical Procedure will be also provided. 

5.1 Numerical Setup (Procedure) 

This procedure comprises the use of ANSYS WorkBench (WB) 16.1, ANSYS Meshing 16.1 and 

ANSYS FLUENT 16.1 that were used on this thesis. A Fluid Flow (FLUENT) template was chosen 

to start this procedure (default Analysis System), which includes a sequence of steps as: 

Geometry, Mesh, Setup, Solution and Results. 

5.1.1 Model Design and Flow Domain 

Following the sequence referred above, the Geometry was designed using the CATIA V5R24. 

The Geometry was imported to the WB in a file format Computer-Aided Design (CAD). To define 

the Flow Domain, a Control Volume (CV) was also created. There are no exact guideline values 

regarding the dimensions of this CV, although several authors [11], [52], [57], [63] refer that 

the solution domain needs to be large enough to capture the entire wake development. 

Therefore, the CV dimensions were chosen to ensure that all interactions and wake 

developments were captured. The Figure 5.1 shows the Fluid Domain dimensions used for this 

Numerical Simulation. 



Numerical Setup (Procedure)  Chapter 5 • Numerical Analysis 

 56 

 

Figure 5.1 - Control Volume dimensions. 

The hull dimensions (Diameter of 340 mm and mid-body length of 1500 mm) used to function 

comparatively as base for CV dimensions. However, in this case it was not applied, since the 

literature review varies too much to define a precise value which guarantees that the flow is 

not affected due to small dimensions of CV [11], [52], [57], [63]. 

The front of the CV is semi-circular, as demonstrated in Figure 5.1. Due to a more complex 

calculus (higher computational cost) with relative velocity passing by the corners when 

operating at high AoA, this configuration was adopted to simplify the process, improve mesh 

quality and help with results convergence. 

Since the CV is only relative to the flow field, the hull body was removed from the CV, to apply 

all fluid parameters/conditions in the CV, i.e. the CV must be occupied only with fluid, the 

body’s volume must be extracted.  

5.1.2 Meshing Process  

After defining the Fluid Domain, the division of the flow into small elements must be done. The 

software ANSYS Meshing was used to do this decomposition. During the Meshing Process, there 

are several important parameters which influence the Numerical Simulation Results, as domain 

size, mesh size and distance of the first layer of the cells to the hull (?), controlled by the 

Inflation Layer. This distance introduces to ?+ parameter. ?+ is the dimensionless number from 

the body’s surface to the near wall node and it is given by the Equation (5.1), 

 ?+  =  
?. ??

?
 (5.1) 



Chapter 5 • Numerical Analysis  Numerical Setup (Procedure) 

 57 

Where ? is the distance of the first layer of the cells to the hull, ?? the friction velocity and ? 

the local kinematic viscosity of the fluid. 

The friction velocity (??) can be expressed as (Equation (5.2)), 

 ?? =  ?
??
?

 (5.2) 

Where ?? is the shear stress and ? the density. 

Turbulent flows are considerably affected by the presence of walls. So, an accurate 

representation of the flow in the near-wall region gives a better prediction of wall-bounded 

turbulent flows. Thereby, depending on each Turbulence Model and Near-Wall Treatment, 

there is a range of optimum values for ?+ where the reliability of numerical solutions is 

improved, i.e. controlling the Inflation Layer, the ? + can be adjusted into this range. For ?-? 

turbulence model, the calculation of the boundary layer is substituted by a wall function 

reducing this way the computational requirements. Nevertheless, the use of these wall 

functions can only be performed if the value of ?+ is between 30 and 300.[42].  

In order to optimize the Meshing Results as much as possible, several parameters were tested 

to understand how their influence on results. The input parameters tested are shown in Table 

5.1. Thus, the output parameters as Cell number ?+ are also shown in Table 5.1. Several other 

Meshing tests were made, however only the most relevant are shown below.

Applied exclusively on Hull faces, the input parameters modified during several attempts were: 

Element size, Curvature Normal Angle, Growth Rate and Minimum size of an element. 

The Element size specifies the element size used for the specific selection, in this case, to Hull 

faces. The Curvature Normal Angle is the maximum angle that one element edge is allowed to 

span. Growth Rate represents the increase between succeeding layer elements. The Minimum 

size of an element represents the minimum size that is allowed to elements for the specific 

selection [64].   

The Wake section is a volume created to add a specific refinement at the desired location. This 

Wake is represented in Figure 5.2. 

 

Figure 5.2 - Shape of the Wake for an improved Mesh treatment. 

As can be seen in Figure 5.2, the Wake’s shape was chosen to improve the mesh refinement on 

a specific location where the Wake development is crucial. The Element size was adjusted to 

understand how important was the mesh treatment on that location. 

The Mesh section refers to the Mesh in general. Elements not selected for a specific treatment, 

will follow the condition imposed by Mesh section. It is important to defined the Maximum 

Element Size in a far field and its Growth Rate, as shown in Table 5.1. 

The Inflation Layer, that includes the parameters First cell height, Number of layers and Growth 

Rate, represents the Boundary Layer. This is a crucial section to the Meshing Process. The 

boundary layer height should be predicted by empirical methods and then similar represented 

at Inflation Layer. Details about Boundary Layer can be seen in reference [32]. 



Numerical Setup (Procedure)  Chapter 5 • Numerical Analysis

The Meshing Results are shown in Figure 5.3. The Mesh domain was converted from Tetrahedral 

Mesh to Polyhedral Mesh, since Polyhedral Mesh requires a smaller computational cost and keep 

showing good Results by improving the Mesh quality. 

 

Figure 5.3 - Left) Mesh Result; Right) Detailed Nose Mesh Result. 

Figure 5.3 presents the Mesh Result with a refinement on Body Wake (Figure 5.3 - Left). This 

Result had nearly 1 million Polyhedral cells, and the range of ?+ was between 35 and 45 (Table 

5.1, grey column). Furthermore, the Inflation Layer can be also seen (Figure 5.3 - Right) with 

an improved refinement with comparison to the entire Mesh. Knowing that the ?+ for Standard 

?-? Turbulence Model (used on Figure 5.3) should be close but above 30 and bellow 300, these 

values are quite acceptable. 

5.1.3 Physical Model Setup and Simulation 

Fluid properties 

The liquid water was chosen as fluid. The fluid properties are shown in Table 5.2. 

Table 5.2 - Fluid properties. 

Density 1027 [kg/m3] 

Viscosity 0.00167 [kg/(s.m)] 

 

Boundary Conditions 

To define several parameters at Fluid Domain, the boundary conditions were specified. The 

Sidewalls of the CV, corresponding to far-field flow, were defined as symmetry plane to highly 

reduce the CPU cost on those boundaries. The hull body was defined with a Stationary wall 

condition (no-slip condition). The velocity inlet boundary condition was applied at the Inlet. 

Pressure-outlet boundary condition was applied at outlet. 

The flow velocities were set and changed at velocity inlet boundary condition. The flow 

direction was decomposed when a specific AoA was desired. Thus, turbulence quantities were 



Chapter 5 • Numerical Analysis  Numerical Validation 

 61 

also set. Since the simulations were compared with experimental towing tank tests, the 

turbulence intensity was set to be 0.05% and the turbulence length was equal to 7% of the hull 

body length (Dantas &amp;amp; Barros, 2013). 

The convergence criteria adopted for this Numerical Simulation was 10-5 in residuals. 

Two Turbulence Models were chosen for the Numerical Simulations: Standard ?-? and ?-? SST 

models. A mesh-independent study was also made to evaluate which Turbulence Model was 

chosen, following a mesh-quality/computational cost trade-off. The Chart 5.1 demonstrates 

this study. Two empirical methods were also implemented to compare against the Turbulence 

Models. These empirical methods were G&amp;amp;J and VT methods applied by Alam et al. [36] on their 

study. 

 

Chart 5.1 - Mesh-independency study (referent to Table 5.1). 

As can be seen in Chart 5.1, the Standard ?-? Turbulence Model requires a lower computational 

cost when compared to the ?-? SST Model to stabilize, i.e. Standard ?-? Turbulence Model 

better predicts Drag value for lower computational cost, while the Drag value do not stabilize 

for ?-? SST Model, not even using higher computational cost. Consequently, the Standard ?-? 

was the Turbulence Model adopted. 

5.2 Numerical Validation  

In order to validate the Numerical Simulations against the Experimental Tests, a pertinent 

procedure was adopted. Following the Experimental Test Results used in Chapter 4, the 

comparison Numerical/Experimental was made. Therefore, the N/D ratio was fixed at 0.8 

(optimum Experimental Nose length) and the T/D ratio varied between 1.6 and 3.2, for each 

specific Tail shape (Elliptical and Conical) and then comparing the Experimental Tests with 

Numerical Simulations. However, due to the scale difference between each Procedure

(Experimental and Numerical), the Reynold’s similarity was applied to guarantee similar flow 

conditions. However, it was not possible to apply the Equations (2.7) and (2.8), since these 

Equations assume the same fluid properties in both cases. Therefore, Table 5.3 shows the 

Reynold’s similarity done, considering different flow properties.  

Table 5.3 – Reynold’s Similarity applied.

As can be seen in Table 5.3, to assume the similar Reynold’s number for Experimental model 

and full-scale prototype, these conditions showed must be respected. To achieve similar flow 

conditions for the experimental model travelling at 1 m/s, the full-scale prototype should be 

tested for a velocity of 0.45 m/s (see Table 5.3).  The Reynold’s number it is not the same for 

both cases, but as demonstrated the Error is so small (0.3%), that it is assumed equal Reynold’s 

numbers to achieve a desired operational velocity of the full-scale prototype. 

Consequently, the Chart 5.2 &amp;amp; Chart 5.3 demonstrates this study for an Elliptical and Conical 

Tail shapes, respectively.

is an offset between them. The deviation for each T/D ratio between Experimental and 

Numerical Results is observed at Table 5.4, for Elliptical and Conical cases.

Table 5.4 demonstrates a difference between 27% to 36%, when comparing Experimental and 

Numerical Results, for both Tail shapes. Since there are several errors associated with this 

Comparison (Error scale effect, Reynold’s number similarity, Towing tank conditions, Load cell 

precision, Numerical predictions and even water’s temperature) these results indicate a good 

agreement. 

The Chart 5.2 &amp;amp; Chart 5.3 also concludes that the Conical Tail produces a lower Drag for 

Experimental and Numerical Results. This phenomenon can be understood by visually analyzing 

the Figure 5.4.

Figure 5.4 - Velocity contours/vectors for different Tail configurations at nominal velocity 

(full-scale prototype) of 0.45 m/s. 

The Figure 5.4 shows different Tail configurations operating at 0? of AoA and nominal velocity 

of 0.45 m/s for full-scale prototype, and their associated velocity phenomena. Thus, by 

analyzing the Figure 5.4 and following the energy conservation principle, it can be seen that 

the Conical Tail produce a lower Drag when compared with the other geometries. The first line 

of Figure 5.4, shows a hull body without nose and tail, where the velocity achieves its lowest 

point at Nose or Bow, since there is no Nose in this case. This point is known as Stagnation Point 

(following the energy conservation principle, this point is also the highest point of pressure). 

At Tail or Stern, there are several Eddies created (Large and Small Scale). These Eddies, 

contribute greatly to the increase of Drag, becoming smaller with an Elliptical Tail (Figure 5.4 

- second line) and almost disappearing with Conical Tail (Figure 5.4 – third line). Therefore, 

Figure 5.4 also validates the Conical Tail as being the configuration that produces the lowest 

Drag (according to the geometries observed on this study). The size of eddies (length scale) is 

highest for geometries without nose and tail, decreasing for elliptical geometries and achieve 

its lowest size for conical geometries. Moreover, Drag decreases with the decrease of size.

6 Conclusions 

An experimental procedure has been developed to investigate the effects of velocity, angles of 

attack and length-to-diameter ratio on the forces and coefficients acting on a torpedo-shaped 

hull body travelling at fully submerged depth. Using the commercial software ANSYS FLUENT, 

numerical simulations have been completed to validate them against experimental results. 

At the beginning of this study, the objectives consisted in a hydrodynamic optimization, by 

Experimental Tests and Numerical Simulation, of a single-hull vehicle with similar dimensions 

of MEDUSA Deep-Sea lower-hull. However, due to several restrictions, the hull’s dimensions 

were adapted to make this study possible. Thus, these dimensions leaded to a need of a 

Reynold’s Number Similarity between full scale prototype and smaller hull prototype to predict 

hydrodynamic forces and coefficients. 

6.1 Difficulties 

Although the aim of this study was the validation of the Numerical Simulation with the 

Experimental Procedure, the Experimental Setup was, undoubtedly, the phase in which most 

issues occurred. The Experimental Setup process was, at the same time, very challenging and 

enriching.  This process was not considered at the beginning, however, due to its necessity, it 

was also implemented. A lot of issues requiring a lot of time/efforts spent were encountered. 

Many considerations and procedures were adopted to overcome all of these complications. 

Nevertheless, some of these issues were not possible to overcome, like the lack of a 

dynamometer (load cell) applied for lower tensions or the rail offset (relatively to towing tank). 

Several rails corrections were made, albeit with no success due to material deformity. The 

solution adopted to avoid this problem was to find a location inside the towing tank, in which 

the results were not affected by rail offset. Regarding to the dynamometer, several options 

were attempted, like using load cells of a conventional balance weight or using a load cell 

(20kgs) with a MSP430 micro-CPU (Central Processing Unit), however these options were not 

well succeeded.  

Finding a functional thread to pull the towing carriage was also very challenging. The 

requirements initially imposed were to find a thread with a low diameter that can be neglected 

(higher diameters could introduce low pitch angles on towing carriage when the thread was 

rolling) and that was able to hold relatively high tension forces (the tension necessary to start 

pulling the towing carriage was up to twenty times more than the tensions observed and 

considered on this study). To avoid these tensions, the Frequency Inverter was programmed to 



Results  Chapter 6 • Conclusions 

 68 

have a slope at the Start/End of each run, i.e. during each run, the towing carriage started 

gradually to increase its velocity until reached the desired speed and the opposite happened at 

the end. The returning process used was extremely hard to implement, due to the necessity of 

leaving a precise clearance at the returning thread to do not interfere on results. However, 

once implemented, it was possible to fully control the towing carriage only with the Frequency 

Inverter. 

The Model Design/Prototype Manufacturing was also a challenging process. Although, as could 

have been anticipated, the Prototype Manufacturing was made by a commercial company, 

leading to a number of restrictions imposed to the Model Design. This has led to continue 

monitoring by a professional CAD designer to fully respect imposed restrictions. The AoA system 

was a helpful method created to exactly respect the desired pitch angle. Many interactions 

between the Design and the Production of the prototype were observed and learned during this 

process. 

Regarding the results obtained from the Experimental Procedure, these seems acceptable. 

Initially, it was expected to predict clearly the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients for each 

specific combination, although with the conditions imposed by materials that were being used, 

finishing all the Experiments was not possible. However, the data collected was more than 

sufficient to later validate against the Numerical Simulation. Before data analyzing, and after 

in some cases, the Experiment Test Results were not coherent, demonstrating the influence 

caused by several problems (as referred above). Nevertheless, as every Experimental 

Procedure, many lessons were learned during this process. It was concluded that the 

temperature of the water used on the towing tank was a crucial parameter to this study (greatly 

affecting the Reynolds number used for the Reynold’s similarity by varying the Density and 

Viscosity). However, this parameter was not controllable by author. During a day, the water’s 

temperature could vary, depending on the laboratory’s temperature.  

The Numerical Simulations were fully dependent to the computational time cost, leading to, in 

some cases, some simulations longing for several days. Find an acceptable range of ?+ was also 

very challenging. 

6.2 Results 

The small dimensions of the towing tank directly interfered with Results, showing better Results 

for smaller geometries. However, by the Numerical Study made, this is not always true. Thus, 

as proven by Figure 5.4, too small geometries produce higher Drag (influence of Eddies at 

Stern). 

Analyzing the geometries studied for Experimental and Numerical Studies, the Elliptical and 

Conical Tail shape showed similar Results for both studies, although the Conical Tail shape 

demonstrated to be the optimum configuration, producing the lowest Drag. 



Chapter 6 • Conclusions  Further Work 

 69 

Relatively to the Experimental Results, N/D = 0.8 and T/D = 1.6 was the optimum configuration. 

Although there are some questionable results for high AoA’s and velocities, especially for 20? 

of AoA and traveling at 1 m/s. However, these Results are quite interesting to note, once there 

is a lack of Towing Tank studies varying AoA’s. Normally, studies made by other authors [52], 

observe the effect of submergence depth, velocity or sideslip angle. Results demonstrate that 

AoA’s greater than 20? should be avoided for further Towing Tank tests. 

The Numerical Simulation was validated against the Experimental Tests, demonstrating a 

percentage Error between 27 and 36 %. This error difference could be optimized depending on 

CPU costs or using a more precise equipment on experimental procedure. However, the 

Standard ?-? Turbulence model showed a good prediction for Drag values using low 

computational costs, when compared with other Turbulence Models (as ?-? SST Model). 

Simulations also support the Experimental Tests Results on the optimum configuration, 

predicting the Conical Tail has the configuration that produces a lower Drag. Furthermore, 

these Simulations also revealed a huge increase on Drag for higher AoA’s (20?), denoting that 

operation under high AoA’s should be avoid. 

It can be concluded that, the Results, in general, showed a good and adequate agreement. 

Although, several considerations/methods can be adopted to improve Experimental and 

Numerical Results. Some of these considerations are going to be described in next section 

(Further Works). 

6.3 Further Work 

As mentioned throughout this thesis, there are several considerations that were not accounted, 

due to lack of some resources/equipment. Therefore, results can be improved by solving some 

of these mishaps or finding alternative solutions for them. Further Work is here purpose to 

improve the results or to expand this study. These further work topics are: 

- A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system should be used to precisely analyze the 

flow around the hull body. The phenomena observed could then be compared with 

Numerical Simulations to guarantee similar behavior of flow between Numerical 

and Experimental procedures; 

- Using other Towing Tank (higher dimensions) and a more precise Dynamometer, the 

Tests should be repeated and other parameters can be also tested, as Sideslip 

angle; 

- Through other Turbulence Models (higher CPU cost), evaluate the difference of 

Results, justifying precisely the trade-off between Quality of 

Results/Computational Costs; 



Further Work  Chapter 6 • Conclusions 

 70 

- A complete study using ASE methods should be done for Experimental correction. 

Thus, the error associated for each case (considering the error of each component) 

should be determined; 

- A study of fairing’s influence should be done. This study must comprise results for 

tests with and without fairings to evaluate its necessity; 

- A similar study should be done using a hull body with appendages to compare both 

cases. Drag should be measured, firstly, for hull body and then including all 

components.

F.2 Data collection 

Table F.2 – Data collected for one Drag value; Here, each column represents data collected for one run. After 10 runs, the average value and the standard 

deviation were calculated; consecutively, the undesired values were excluded through data refinement (using the average value and the standard 

deviation).
