Abstract – The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of irrigation and of the presence of brachiaria (Urochloa 
decumbens) between coffee (Coffea arabica) rows on coffee yield and on chemical and hydrophysical attributes of a 
Typic Haplustox. The study was conducted in the Cerrado region in Planaltina, Brasília, DF, Brazil, in a randomized 
complete block design, arranged in split-split plots, with four replicates. Water regimes (irrigated or rainfed) were 
assigned to the main plots, inter-row management systems to the subplots, and soil layers to the sub-subplots. The 
following soil attributes were determined: total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, carbon and nitrogen stocks, 
bulk density, aggregate stability, total porosity, macroporosity, low-retention microporosity, remaining microporosity, 
criptoporosity, and total and readily-available water, besides coffee yield. Irrigation of coffee plants, associated with 
brachiaria intercropped as a cover crop, increased coffee yield and favored chemical and hydrophysical soil attributes, 
improving soil structure and its ability to store water. Irrigation favors organic carbon stocks in the upper soil layers, 
whereas brachiaria favors soil physical attributes related to water availability to coffee.

Index terms: Coffea arabica, Urochloa decumbens, cover crops, soil physical quality, soil porosity, water availability.

irrigação do cafeeiro, associada ao consórcio com braquiária como planta de cobertura, aumentou a produtividade de 
café e favoreceu os atributos químicos e físico-hídricos do solo, o que melhorou a estrutura do solo e a sua capacidade 
em armazenar água. A irrigação favorece o estoque de carbono nas camadas superficiais do solo, enquanto a braquiária 
favorece os atributos físicos do solo relacionados à disponibilidade de água para o cafeeiro.

Introduction

The coffee (Coffea arabica L.) crop is expanding 
in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) region of Brazil, 
with a production of 5.9 million bags in 2013, which 
corresponds to 15.4% of the Brazilian production 
(Acompanhamento..., 2014). A major climatic 

characteristic of the Cerrado biome is a well-defined 
dry season during winter and the recurrent occurrence 
of dry spell periods during the rainy season. Therefore, 
irrigation is an essential practice for achieving high 
yields, profitability, and high quality coffee grains 
(Bonomo et al., 2008; Lima et al., 2008; Costa et al., 
2013; Sakai et al., 2013).

Chemical and hydrophysical attributes of an Oxisol under coffee 1477

Pesq. agropec. bras., Brasília, v.51, n.9, p.1476-1483, set. 2016
DOI: 10.1590/S0100-204X2016000900046 

The development and expansion of the coffee crop 
in the Cerrado occurred predominantly in Oxisols 
(Eberhardt et al., 2008), a soil class that covers over 
50% of this region. Despite the fact that this soil class 
has favorable management characteristics, it shows 
strong chemical and hydrophysical limitations.

Aggregate stability is reported to decrease in coffee 
production systems without the use of organic residues 
in the inter-rows (Nunes et al., 2010), jeopardizing 
soil structure. Moreover, Bicalho (2011) concluded 
that coffee irrigation in the Cerrado region favored 
aggregation and total organic carbon (TOC) on soil 
surface, when associated with cover crops in between 
coffee rows.

Rocha et al. (2014) observed that brachiaria, 
Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D. Webster, improves 
soil quality due to the direct action of its roots on 
soil structure. This forage is very used in the Cerrado 
region, but it is commonly considered an invasive 
and potentially competitive weed to the coffee 
crop (Magalhães et al., 2012; Siqueira et al., 2015). 
However, its high adaptability, appropriate architecture 
for intercropping in coffee production system, easy 
natural reseeding, hardiness, easy maintenance, and 
resistance to mechanization are features that qualify 
this species as a potential cover crop in the inter-rows 
of coffee trees (Wutke et al., 2014).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect 
of irrigation and of the presence of brachiaria (Urochloa 
decumbens) in between coffee (Coffea arabica) rows 
on coffee yield and on chemical and hydrophysical 
attributes of a Typic Haplustox.

Materials and Methods

The experimental area is located at Embrapa 
Cerrados (15°35'4''S, 47°43'51''W, at 1,009-m altitude) 
in Planaltina, Brasília, DF, Brazil. Soil attributes were 
studied in a Latossolo Vermelho distrófico típico, i.e., 
a Typic Haplustox, and an area with native Cerrado 
vegetation was used as reference (Table 1). From 
2000 to 2007, the experimental area was covered 
with brachiaria, but it had not been used as pasture. 
On December 2007, 'Catuaí Vermelho IAC 144' coffee 
seedlings were planted with 3.50x0.70-m spacing. 
At planting, fertilization consisted of 120 g triple 
superphosphate, 50 g magnesium thermophosphate 
(Yoorin – Mineração Curimbaba Ltda., Poços de Caldas, 
MG, Brazil), and 24.5 g fritted trace elements (FTE) 

per plant. Previously, 2 Mg ha-1 dolomitic limestone 
were broadcasted and incorporated in the whole area, 
in order to increase soil base saturation to 50%. In the 
following years, the nutritional management of the 
crop was carried out according to Guerra et al. (2007).

Two water regimes were evaluated: irrigated, 
according to the recommendations of Guerra et al. 
(2007); and a rainfed treatment. The irrigations were 
discontinued from the end of June until the beginning 
of September in each year, in order to induce uniform 
flowering after resuming irrigation (Guerra et al., 2007). 
Soil water content was measured with the soil moisture 
sensor ML1 (Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge, United 
Kingdom).

Inter-row management systems consisted of 
brachiaria intercropped in between rows of coffee 
plants, and of a traditional planting system without 
brachiaria. In the brachiaria-covered treatment, cover 
plants were mechanically cut when they reached 0.60-
m height; and, in the traditional treatment, the soil was 
kept free of brachiaria or any other weed by manual 
cleaning. Plant residues remained on the soil surface.

1478 O.C. Rocha et al.

Pesq. agropec. bras., Brasília, v.51, n.9, p.1476-1483, set. 2016

Soil samples were taken in April 2012, in three soil 
layers: 0.00–0.05, 0.05–0.10, and 0.10–0.20 m, on the 
projection of the coffee plant canopy. A composite 
sample of five subsamples from each plot was analyzed 
for TOC and total nitrogen by the Walkley-Black and 
Bremner-Mulvaney methods, respectively (Claessen, 
1997), and their respective stocks were calculated with 
the soil layer and equivalent soil mass methods (De 
Bona et al., 2006). The soil from a native Cerrado area, 
adjacent to the experimental area, was considered as  
reference.

Two soil samples from each layer were collected 
to determine aggregate stability. These samples were 
sieved using 8 and 4-mm meshes. The retained soil 
was analyzed, and, from these unstructured samples, 
two 50-g subsamples were taken, one to determine 
moisture level and the other to determine aggregate 
stability according to Claessen (1997). The mean 
weight diameter of stable aggregates was calculated 
as described in Netto et al. (2009) and Coutinho et al. 
(2010).

In March 2012, soil hydrophysical properties were 
analyzed in unstructured and structured soil samples, 
collected on the projection of the coffee plant canopy. 
Structured soil samples were taken with metal rings (50-
mm diameter and 51-mm height) for determining soil 
bulk density and water retention capacity (Costa et al., 
2008) in the soil-water tensions of 1, 3, 6, 10, 33, 60, 
100, and 1,500 kPa. The soil-water retention curve was 
adjusted according to the model (Genuchten, 1980),

? ? ? ? ??= + ?( ) +( )??
?
?{ }r s r m n
m

1 ,

in which: ? is the soil water content (m3 m-3); ?s is the 
saturated soil water content (m3 m-3); ?r is the residual 
water content (m3 m-3); ?m is the soil water matric 
potential (kPa); and ?, m, and n are the empirical 
parameters of the equation, obtained with the NLIN 
procedure of the SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Soil texture was 
determined with the pipette method, in the unstructured 
sampled soil (Claessen, 1997).

Soil water availability was obtained from total 
available water (TAw) and readily-available water 
(RAw), with the expressions: Taw = ?6 - ?1,500 and  
RAw = ?6 - ?100, in which ?6, ?100, and ?1,500 are the 
volumetric moisture at the matric potential of 6, 100, 
and 1,500 kPa, respectively.

Pore size determination was based on Resck et al. 
(2008). The relative distribution of pore size was 
calculated by separating the pores according to their 
diameter, as: macropores, micropores with low-water 
retention, remaining micropores, and cryptopores 
(Rocha et al., 2014).

The experiment was carried out in a randomized 
complete block design, with a split-split-plot 
arrangement and four replicates, considering water 
regimes as the main plot, inter-row management systems 
as the subplot, and soil layers as the sub-subplots. Data 
normality was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk test, 
followed by analysis of variance (Anova), and Tukey’s 
test was used to compare the means, at 5% probability. 
The effects of water regimes and inter-row management 
systems on soil attributes were evaluated with principal 
component analysis (PCA). Statistical analyzes were 
carried out using PCA with XLSTAT 2014 (Addinsoft, 
New York, NY, USA) and the SAS software, version 
9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results and Discussion

Treatments did not differ as to total available water, soil 
density, and soil C/N ratio. However, significant effects 
of the inter-row management system were observed 
on micropores of low-water retention and on readily-
available water. Differences were also significant among 
soil layers for remaining micropores and total nitrogen 
stock. For macropores, significant differences were 
found for water regimes and for inter-row management 
systems (Table 2). In addition, significant interactions 
were detected between water regimes and soil layers 
for total porosity, cryptopores, TOC, and carbon stock. 
There were also significant interactions between water 
regimes and inter-row management systems for yield, 
besides a triple significant interaction among water 
regimes, inter-row management systems, and soil layers 
for the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates (Tables 
3, 4, and 5).

Irrigation decreased macropores in 9.8% and 
covered inter-row in 4.9% (Table 2). These decreases 
enhance soil-water retention capacity and, as long as 
they do not negatively affect soil aeration, they are 
beneficial for water use efficiency and conservation. 
In the experimental area, the soil had total porosity 
of 0.61 m3 m-3 and average volume of macropores of  
0.21 m3 m-3, considered a good aeration level according 
to Rodrigues et al. (2011).

Chemical and hydrophysical attributes of an Oxisol under coffee 1479

Pesq. agropec. bras., Brasília, v.51, n.9, p.1476-1483, set. 2016
DOI: 10.1590/S0100-204X2016000900046 

Growing brachiaria in the inter-rows of coffee plants 
increased the fraction of micropores with low-water 
retention from 17.6 to 20.1%, when compared with the 
traditional system without the forage. This represented 
a significant increase of 18.2% in the readily-available 
water (Table 2). These results agree with those 
reported by Rocha et al. (2014), which attribute them 
to the aggregating action of the brachiaria root system. 
However, the remaining micropores were not affected by 
water regime and inter-row management. Despite this, 
they were differentiated in the soil layers: the top layer, 
from 0.00 to 0.05 m (A), differed significantly from the 
next two layers from 0.05 to 0.10 m (B) and from 0.10 to 
0.20 m (C), but without any effect on soil water storage.

Significant differences were observed in total 
nitrogen and nitrogen stock in the soil, when 
comparing layer C to the other ones (Table 2). Total 
nitrogen decreased from soil layer A to C, from 1.88 to 
1.63 g kg-1. Actually, the nitrogen stock in the top 0.10 
m of soil, i.e., layers A and B (1.74 Mg ha-1) was 13% 
higher than that of the following 0.10 m, that is, layer 
C (1.54 Mg ha-1). According to Rangel &amp;amp; Silva (2007), 
soil nitrogen stocks are mainly controlled by climatic 
conditions and vegetation cover, and the introduction 
of new species with great biomass production capacity 
can benefit soil nitrogen storage (Mielniczuk et al., 
2003), particularly on the top soil layers that are more 
exposed to climate and management practices.

The irrigated regime increased productivity in both 
inter-row management systems (Table 3), whereas the 
rainfed regime decreased production, due to brachiaria 
competition with coffee plants. It should be noted 

that irrigation increased productivity in 47.1 and 33.3 
bags per hectare, respectively, when compared to the 
rainfed condition with and without brachiaria in the 
inter-rows. These results indicate an outstanding effect 
of irrigation on coffee productivity, which agrees 
with Bonomo et al. (2008). Regarding the inter-row 
management systems, the presence of brachiaria 
increased coffee productivity in 10%, in the irrigated 
treatment, and reduced it in 42%, in the rainfed one, 
due to severe competition for water and nutrients.

Water regimes and soil layers interacted regarding 
total porosity, cryptopores, TOC, and carbon stock 
(Table 4). Irrigation was the major factor affecting 
total porosity, with significant difference of -7% 
between soil layers A and C. Furthermore, significant 
differences, also of -7%, occurred between the A layers 
of the irrigated and rainfed treatments. This indicates 
that soil surface layers of irrigated crops are highly 
susceptible to soil compaction.

Irrigation had a direct effect on the cryptopore 
fraction (Table 4). In layer A, it reduced in 12.5% from 
rainfed to irrigated regimes. Moreover, the differences 
in cryptopores between layers A and B amounted to 
7.5%. According to Tognon et al. (1997), cryptopores 
are the intra-aggregate pores in non-anthropized soils, 
and changes found in pore size distribution result from 
the arrangement of these aggregates. The results of 
the present work indicate that, in agricultural soils, 
irrigation is an important factor directly affecting the 
presence of cryptopores.

TOC was higher in the top 0.10-m soil layer of the 
irrigated plots (Table 4). However, differences were

significant only in the B layer, in which organic carbon 
increased from 25.58 g kg-1, in the rainfed treatment, 
to 29.32 g kg-1 in the irrigated plots. This 15% increase 
was probably due to irrigation effects on the root system 
distribution of brachiaria and coffee plants, as well as to 
the greater production of organic residues in the irrigated 
plots. Considering layers A and B, average TOC in 
irrigated plots increased 24%, in comparison to layer 
C; however, in the rainfed treatments, no significant 
differences were observed between soil layers. In 
general, about 50% TOC was stored in the top 0.10 m of 
soil. This result agrees with Rangel et al. (2008).

The behavior of carbon stocks in relation to water 
regime and soil layers was similar to that observed 
for TOC (Table 4). Significant differences were only 
found in the B layer that showed a 15% increase in 
carbon stocks under irrigation, compared to rainfed 
conditions. Carbon stock in the top 0.10 m represented 
46 and 54% of the total stock from 0.00 to 0.30 m, 
in rainfed and irrigated treatments, respectively. The 
total amounts and the relative distribution of organic 
carbon in the soil profile can be affected by soil 
class, water deficit intensity, and management system 
(De Bona et al., 2006). However, in perennial crops 
like coffee, in which the soil is hardly disturbed, there 
is a tendency for organic matter preservation in the top 

soil layers, where most of the root system of the coffee 
trees is found.

In the present study, carbon stock in the top 0.20-m 
soil layer averaged 49.5 Mg ha-1, in the coffee tree 
canopy projection. This value is 28% higher than the 
one reported by Silva et al. (2013), in a Typic Haplustox 
cultivated with 'Catuaí' coffee trees. The difference of 
10.7 Mg ha-1 between studies can be partially explained 
by the presence of brachiaria for seven years before the 
installation of this experiment.

Table 5 presents a triple interaction of the mean 
weighted diameter of soil aggregates, which increased 
33% in soil layer A with irrigation and brachiaria in the 
inter-rows, in comparison to the rainfed plots. However, 
the lack of inter-row cultivation with brachiaria 
negatively affected aggregate stability, decreasing 
mean weight diameter in 28%. This allows to compare 
the aggregation state of different types of soils and 
soil layers (Kato et al., 2010). Since the effect of soil 
management on aggregate stability is mainly controlled 
by the size of aggregates, decreases in stability indicate 
a deleterious effect of the management system on soil 
structure (Souza et al., 2004).

Under irrigation, brachiaria increased the mean 
weight diameter by 34% (Table 5), an evidence of 
the positive effect of this treatment on the stability of 
aggregates. However, the presence of the forage in 
the rainfed treatments decreased this attribute in 27%. 
Analogously, considering each soil layer in relation to 
the water regime and management system, layer B had 
a 27% higher mean weight diameter than the top soil 
layer A, in the irrigated treatment without brachiaria 
planted in the inter-rows. This indicates a loss of 
aggregate stability in the 0.05-m layer, probably due 
to the direct exposure of the top soil to management 
practices, since this result was not observed with the 
presence of brachiaria. In this regard, grasses have a 
strong, abundant root system that, upon decomposition,

Chemical and hydrophysical attributes of an Oxisol under coffee 1481

can release nutrients and help the buildup of soil organic 
matter, contributing significantly to soil aggregation 
(Mielniczuk et al., 2003).

In the rainfed treatments, the presence of brachiaria 
increased mean weight diameter from 0.05 to 0.20-
m depth (Table 5), which might have been caused by 
an increase in root depth, in response to water deficit. 
However, a decrease in the attribute was verified in soil 
layer C (%) without brachiaria, compared to soil layers 
A (33%) and B (24%).

In the irrigated plots, brachiaria cultivation in the 
inter-rows had a positive effect on aggregate stability, 
as reflected by the mean weight diameter (4.64 mm) in 
all soil layers (Table 6), which was similar to the one 
registered on the undisturbed Cerrado area (4.65 mm). 
This highlights the aggregating effect of the brachiaria 
roots on restructuring soil. The average mean weight 
diameter of layers A and C, for this same treatment, 
was higher (4.75 mm) than the ones observed in the 
Cerrado (4.60 mm).

A clear interaction effect of irrigation and brachiaria 
presence on soil aggregation was found, considering 
the parameters related to soil water storage. Two 
principal components (PC1 and PC2) were generated 
as tools to reveal the effects of water regimes and inter-

row management systems on mean weight diameter, 
as well as of its impacts on readily-available water, 
macropores, and low-water retention micropores. 
The factorial charges for these variables are shown in 
Table 7. For the distribution of the selected variables 
over the soil layers, a cumulative variance of 77.91% 
was observed, resulting from the sum of PC1 and 
PC2 for the variables mean weight diameter, low-
water retention micropores, macropores, and readily-
available water. However, PC1 was responsible for 
53.05% of the variance, distinguishing the coordinates 
into two groups: irrigated system with brachiaria as  
cover crop and rainfed traditional system (Figure 1).

These results support previous discussions related to 
the absolute values of the analyzed variables, especially 
for water storage. Macroporosity was favored in 
the rainfed traditional system (without brachiaria), 
indicating less structure for soil water storage; however, 
the soil water storage capacity, evaluated by readily-
available water and low-water retention micropores, 
was enhanced in the irrigated treatment with brachiaria 
due to an improved soil aggregation (mean weight 
diameter). The vector directions in Figure 1 show that, 
from the selected variables, only macropores were 
placed in the quadrant closely related to the rainfed

Conclusions

1. In the Cerrado region, the association of irrigation 
and brachiaria (Urochloa decumbens) in the coffee 
(Coffea arabica) crop inter-rows favors several soil 
chemical and hydrophysical attributes, improving 
soil structure and its water storage capacity, and also 
improves the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates.

2. The irrigated water regime affects total soil 
porosity, macroporosity, and cryptoporosity, besides 
the location of total organic carbon on the soil profile, 
favoring the stock on soil surface layers.

3. The coffee crop intercropped with brachiaria 
increases the fraction of readily-available water due to an 
increased number of low-retention micropores in the soil.

4. In rainfed coffee crop with brachiaria in the inter-
rows, the forage may compete severely with coffee 
trees, drastically reducing their productivity.

treatment. However, the variables associated to soil 
water storage (readily-available water and low-water 
retention micropores) and to soil aggregation state 
(mean weight diameter) were positioned on the 
opposite quadrants, linked to irrigated treatments 
with brachiaria. Therefore, the use of brachiaria as  
cover crop, associated with coffee crop irrigation, in 
the Cerrado region, enabled the accumulation of soil 
organic matter, favoring its aggregation state (Portella 
et al., 2012), which increased water storage capacity.
