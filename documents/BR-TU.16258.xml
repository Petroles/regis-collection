Abstract 
This work, as a fieldtrip guide, aims to provide a glimpse into the palaeoenvironments, palaeon-

tology, and diagenesis of one of the most productive areas for Late Jurassic dinosaurs and other ver-
tebrates in Europe, namely, the sites of the Lourinhã Formation, which is coeval with the Morrison 
Formation of the midwest USA.

The Late Jurassic rifting phase of the Lusitanian Basin created several sub-basins separated by 
major crustal faults. In the western and central areas of the basin, the Caldas da Rainha structure sep-
arates three sub-basins with different subsidence and infill characteristics (Consolação to the west, 
Bombarral–Alcobaça to the northeast, and Turcifal to the southeast). The Upper Jurassic–lowermost 
Cretaceous succession exposed in the coastal cliffs located between Nazaré and Santa Cruz belongs 
to the Consolação Sub-basin, whereas the coastal outcrops between Santa Cruz and Ericeira show 
units of the Turcifal Sub-basin.

To place the stops into a coherent context, selected units of the fieldtrip area are detailed. The 
stratigraphy of the Upper Jurassic of the Lusitanian Basin is quite complex, and no fully accepted 
overall proposal exists. Thus, a review of lithostratigraphy, sedimentology, age and environmental 
interpretations is presented. Interpretations of palaeoclimate, palaeogeography, and taphonomy con-
tribute to establishing an overview of the landscape where dinosaurs lived and to understanding the 
conditions for their fossilization and preservation. This trip, which takes place from north to south, 
focuses on the vertebrate content, sedimentology, and stratigraphy of the deposits. The first stop 
at Consolação examines the upper Kimmeridgian shallow-marine to deltaic Alcobaça Formation, 
which underlies the Lourinhã Formation. Further south, the Paimogo fort cape gives a scenic view 
of the Lourinhã Formation: to the north, the Praia da Amoreira and Porto Novo members (lower 
coastal plain alluvium, including distal fan and meandering fluvial systems; upper Kimmeridgian), 
and, to the south, the Praia Azul Member (lower coastal plain alluvium with three brackish–marine 
faunally distinct transgressive carbonate levels; uppermost Kimmeridgian to lowermost Tithonian). 
In Paimogo, we visit sites where dinosaur eggs and a sauropod skeleton have been found. The stop at 
the Museum of Lourinhã allows a visit to one of the most important collections of Late Jurassic ver-
tebrates in Europe. The last fieldtrip stop at Porto da Calada examines the top of the Assenta Mem-
ber of the Lourinhã Formation (meandering fluvial system with intercalations of shallow-marine 
lagoonal carbonates; upper Tithonian to lowermost Berriasian) and the Porto da Calada Formation 
(meandering fluvial system with thin levels of estuarine and intertidal flats carbonates; Berriasian) 
and thus includes the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary.

Resumo
Este trabalho, como um guião de campo, visa dar uma visão sobre os paleoambientes, paleonto-

logia e diagénese de uma das áreas mais produtivas para os dinossauros e outros vertebrados do Ju-
rássico da Europa, nomeadamente para a Formação da Lourinhã, que é contemporânea da Formação 
de Morrison, no centro-oeste da América do Norte.

A fase de rifting jurássico da Bacia Lusitaniana criou várias sub-bacias separados por falhas 
principais. Na área ocidental e central da bacia, a estrutura de Caldas da Rainha separa três sub-

1. Introduction

1.1. Regional overview

1.1.1. Tectono-stratigraphic setting

The deposits visited during the fieldtrip belong to 
the North Atlantic rift-related Lusitanian Basin, lo-
cated on the western coast of Portugal and extending 
from Aveiro to Cabo Espichel (Fig. 1). The oldest unit 
was deposited during the Late Triassic and the basin 
had become almost fully filled by the Cenomanian 
(Rey et al., 2006). In the region, the later sedimentary 
cover is relatively thin and ranges from Upper Creta-
ceous to Holocene.

The Lusitanian Basin underwent a major rifting 
phase during the late Oxfordian to earliest Kim-
meridgian, with fault and fault-related diapiric activ-
ity creating several sub-basins, in particular between 
the Nazaré and Lisbon parallels. These included the 
Bombarral–Alcobaça, Arruda, and Turcifal sub-ba-
sins (Leinfelder &amp;amp; Wilson, 1998; Alves et al., 2003), 

and the recently proposed Consolação (Martinius &amp;amp; 
Gowland, 2011; Taylor et al., 2013) and Lower Tagus 
(Carvalho et al., 2005) sub-basins (Fig. 2).

During the Late Jurassic rifting stage, the Cal-
das da Rainha fault separated and tilted the half-gra-
bens of the basement. This activity was reflected in 
the sedimentary cover by faults displacing the Lower 
and Middle Jurassic limestones and by major move-
ments of the Lower Jurassic marly and evaporitic 
Dagorda Formation (“salt”). During the extensional 
activity, the salt pillow that formed over the basement 
structure enlarged, fed by salt withdrawal caused by 
the depositional load developing in the sub-basins. 
Thus, even during the early post-rifting phase, this 
large feature separated three sub-basins with differ-
ent amounts of subsidence and infill (Consolação to 
the west, Bombarral–Alcobaça to the northeast, and 
Turcifal to the southeast; Fig. 2), controlled the de-
velopment of marine embayments and the alluvial 
drainage, and was the locus of enhanced shallow-wa-

cico exposta nas arribas costeiras localizadas entre Nazaré e Santa Cruz pertence à Sub-bacia da 
Consolação, enquanto que os afloramentos costeiros entre Santa Cruz e Ericeira expõe unidades da 
Sub-bacia do Turcifal.

Para enquadrar as paragens num contexto coerente, dá-se destaque e detalhe às unidades da área 
visitada. A estratigrafia do Jurássico Superior da bacia é bastante complexa e não existe nenhuma 
proposta totalmente aceita na generalidade, sendo, por isso, apresentada uma revisão de litostratigra-
fia, sedimentologia, idade e interpretações ambientais. Interpretações sobre o paleoclima, paleogeo-
grafia e tafonomia contribuem para uma descrição geral do ambiente onde os dinossauros viveram e 
para a compreensão das condições para a sua fossilização e preservação.

Esta descrição das localidades e horizontes desenrola-se de norte para sul, incidindo sobre os 
vertebrados, sedimentologia e estratigrafia. A primeira paragem é no Kimmeridgiano superior da 
Consolação que mostra um paleoambiente marinho pouco profundo a deltaico da Formação de Al-
cobaça, na qual assenta a Formação da Lourinhã. Mais a sul, o forte de Paimogo permite uma vista 
panorâmica sobre a Fm. da Lourinhã: para o norte estão os membros Praia da Amoreira - Porto Novo 
(planície de aluvião costeira inferior, incluindo a parte distal e sistemas fluviais sinuosos; Kimme-
ridgiano superior) e o Membro Praia Azul para o sul (aluvião e planície costeira, com três níveis 
de carbonato transgressivo e faunas salobra-marinhas distintas; Kimmeridgiano superior e base do 
Titoniano). Em Paimogo encontram-se os locais onde ovos de dinossauro terópode e um esqueleto 
saurópode foram recolhidos. A paragem no Museu da Lourinhã permite visitar uma das mais impor-
tantes coleções de vertebrados do Jurássico Superior na Europa. A última paragem, no Porto da Ca-
lada, aborda a parte superior do Membro da Assenta da Formação da Lourinhã (sistema fluvial com 
meandros e com intercalações de carbonatos de origem lagunar e marinha rasa; Titoniano superior à 
base do Berriasiano) e Formação Porto da Calada (sistema fluvial meandrico com os níveis de finos 
de carbonatos estuarinos e intertidais; Berriasiano), incluindo assim o limite Jurássico-Cretácico.

ter carbonate production (Wilson et al., 1989; Ravnås 
et al., 1997; Alves et al., 2003; Leinfelder, 2004).

The Caldas da Rainha fault is currently inverted 
and expressed in the Mesozoic–Cenozoic cover by 
several local structures, including the Leiria–Parcei-
ros, Maceira, Caldas da Rainha, Bolhos, Vimeiro, and 
Santa Cruz extruded diapirs (Canérot et al., 1995) as 
well as several subvolcanic bodies of latest Jurassic to 
earliest Cretaceous age (Grange et al., 2008).

The Upper Jurassic–lowermost Cretaceous rocks 
of the coastal cliffs between Nazaré and Santa Cruz 
belong to the Consolação sub-basin, whereas the 
coastal outcrops between Santa Cruz and Ericeira are 
part of the Turcifal Sub-basin (Fig. 2). The Consolação 
Sub-basin is bounded to the west by the Berlengas 
marginal basement horst system, and the Turcifal 
Sub-basin is bounded to the east by the Runa fault and 
to the north by the Torres Vedras–Santa Cruz fault.

Subsidence during the late Oxfordian to ear-
ly Kimmeridgian rifting climax was pronounced, 
reaching rates of ~250 m/Myr in the depocenters (El-
lis et al., 1990; Hiscott et al., 1990; Stapel et al., 1996) 
and of up to 2000 m/Myr in the Arruda Sub-basin 
(Alves et al., 2003). The subsequent post-rifting stage 
was characterized by a low level of tectonic activity, 
and the accommodation was generated by thermal 
subsidence and some salt withdrawal. Thus, eusta-
sy was a major control on deposition during the late 
Kimmeridgian to early Berriasian, coupled with a 

general trend of siliciclastic progradation to the west 
and to the south generating diachronic units increas-
ingly continental in character from south to north. 
The rapid shift from marine- to continental-domi-
nated environments around or shortly after the early 
to late Kimmeridgian transition is also clear in the 
faunal assemblages, such as the benthic macrofauna 
(Schneider et al., 2010a). Nevertheless, the Caldas da 
Rainha structure retained a degree of importance in 
the palaeolandscape during most of the Tithonian, 
considering the clear contrast in sedimentary charac-
teristics between the upper members of the Lourinhã 
Formation, namely, the Assenta Mb. (to the south-
east) and the Santa Rita Mb.

The Lourinhã and Alcobaça Formations are of par-
ticular interest on this fieldtrip as they are the units that 
contain the most vertebrate remains in Portugal (and in 
Europe). The Alcobaça Fm. is older and was deposited 
in shallow-marine to brackish environments, where-
as the Lourinhã Fm. was deposited under continental 
conditions. Vertebrate fossils are common in the study 
area (Lapparent &amp;amp; Zbyszewski, 1957; Galton, 1980; 
Mateus, 1998, 2006), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, 
and turtles, with fauna and flora assemblages being 
somewhat similar to those of the Morrison Formation 
in North America, but with coastal influence and some 
European-related faunal input (Mateus, 2006).

The importance of the Porto da Calada Formation 
stems from its position at the Jurassic–Cretaceous

boundary, from its extensive outcrops, and from the 
recently found dinosaur bones.

1.1.2. Lithostratigraphic framework

Building a lithostratigraphic framework for the 
Upper Jurassic of the Lusitanian Basin has proved 
to be a complex issue, with many different proposals 
having been offered by various authors since the late 
nineteenth century (Fig. 3). The difficulty of estab-
lishing such a framework is due to the complex pal-
aeogeography created by the late Oxfordian to early 
Kimmeridgian rifting phase (Wilson, 1988; Reis et 
al., 1996, 2000; Leinfelder &amp;amp; Wilson, 1998; Alves et 
al., 2003; Leinfelder, 2004), the lack of high-resolu-
tion biostratigraphy for most of the record in a shal-
low-marine to continental sedimentary context, and 
the isolation of different blocks as a result of Cenozo-
ic inversion. The units presented in detail below are 
part of this intricate puzzle of both the nature of the 
deposits and their lithostratigraphic nomenclature. 

Choffat was the first to provide a stratigraphic 
organization for the Upper Jurassic of the Lusitani-
an Basin (see, for instance, Choffat, 1901), but with a 
mixed chronostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic ap-
proach. He recognized three main units in the onshore 
deposits of the southern part of the Lusitanian Basin, 
namely, from bottom to top, the Lower Lusitanian 
(divided into the Cabaços Beds and the Montejunto 
Beds), the Upper Lusitanian (the Abadia Beds), and 
the Neojurassic (subdivided into the Lima pseudoal-
ternicosta Beds, the Pterocerian, and the Freixialian). 
That organization, with some updating, was the main 
framework until the 1980s. For example, the 1960 
edition of the 1:50,000 geological map of the Lourin-
hã area (sheet 30-A of the "Carta Geológica de Portu-
gal"; França et al., 1961), also included the following 
lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic units (from 
lower to upper): "Lusitaniano Superior–Camadas de 
Abadia", "Pteroceriano", and "Portlandiano".

After Choffat, attempts to build an integrated 
lithostratigraphic framework connecting the Up-
per Jurassic of several sub-basins (Fig. 3) included 
the studies of Mouterde et al. (1972, 1979), Wilson 
(1979), Leinfelder (1986, 1987), Wilson et al. (1989), 
Reis et al. (1996), Schneider et al. (2009), Martinius 
&amp;amp; Gowland (2011), and Kullberg et al. (2013).

Schneider et al. (2009) proposed another litho-
stratigraphic scheme, which was soon after reviewed 
by the same authors (Fürsich et al., 2009). Once again, 
the names that had been used in previous works were 
used in different senses. The main change was the 

creation of a new meaning for the Farta Pão Forma-
tion, chosen (after Schneider et al., 2009) because it 
was the oldest available name uniting the (also pro-
posed) Sobral, Arranhó I, Arranhó II, and Freixial 
Members.

The most recent lithostratigraphic framework 
for the Upper Jurassic in the Consolação Sub-basin 
was suggested by Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland (2011), who 
proposed a different set of members for the Lourinhã 
Formation, namely, from bottom to top, the São Ber-
nardino, Porto das Barcas, Areia Branca, and Ferrel 
members (Fig. 3). Those authors further assigned the 
Lourinhã Fm. to the Estremadura Group, with the 
formation being stratigraphically located between 
the Consolação and the Torres Vedras formations. 
Recently, the same authors in Taylor et al. (2013) 
referred to the Alcobaça Fm. instead of Consolação 
Fm. In fact, those authors concluded that the Alco-
baça Formation (here the Consolação unit) and the 
Lourinhã Formation cropping out between the Gal-
iota syncline (northeast of Peniche) and Santa Cruz 
can be assigned to the uppermost Kimmeridgian to 
lowermost Tithonian based on the occurrence of the 
dinocyst Subtilisphaera paeminosa (their Conclu-
sion 1). This conclusion is consistent with the isotope 
dates for Praia Azul Mb. (Schneider et al., 2009), but 
does not take into consideration other sections of the 
Consolação Sub-basin with biostratigraphic results, 
namely, the ammonites found by Werner (1986) in the 
lower part of the Consolação unit indicating an early 
Kimmeridgian age, the Sr isotopic ages of Schneider 
et al. (2009), and the various regional correlations 
(e.g., Leinfelder, 1987; Leinfelder &amp;amp; Wilson, 1998; 
Manuppella et al., 1999; Reis et al., 2000; Mateus, 
2006; Fürsich et al., 2009). Furthermore, Taylor et al. 
(2013) recognized that the key marker S. paeminosa 
is recovered only from the Porto das Barcas Mem-
ber (their Conclusion 5) (here the Praia Azul Mb.). 
By coupling the above conclusions, we can deduce 
that the work by Taylor et al. (2013) points to a latest 
Kimmeridgian to earliest Tithonian age for the Praia 
Azul Mb., in agreement with a set of other studies, 
as discussed below. Thus, the part of the Lourinhã 
Fm. above the Praia Azul unit represents most of the 
Tithonian, as proposed in many previous studies. We 
note that the thickness of Lourinhã deposits can reach 
almost 400 m (Wilson, 1979; Taylor et al., 2013), the 
same as for the Farta Pão Fm. further south (Ramalho 
et al., 1993).

As pointed out by Leinfelder (1987), the corre-
lation between the many lithostratigraphic proposals 



80

O. Mateus, et al., Ciências da Terra / Earth Sciences Journal 19 (1), 2017, 75-97

for the upper Kimmeridgian and Tithonian can be 
anchored to an important transgression marked by 
an extensive set of carbonate levels. In the coastal 
outcrops of the Consolação Sub-basin, this set is re-
corded as far north as Paimogo and is included in the 
unit known as the Praia Azul Mb. (Hill, 1989), the 
Sobral Mb. (sensu Manuppella et al., 1999), the Ar-
ranhó I Mb. (sensu Fürsich et al., 2009), or the Porto 
das Barcas Mb. (Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland, 2011; Taylor 
et al., 2013), as well as corresponding to the base of 
the “Pteroceriano” (França et al., 1961; Leinfelder, 
1986).

The meaning of the Alcobaça lithostratigraph-
ic unit has been diverse since the original reference 
made by Choffat (1885). This unit is a shallow-ma-
rine to transitional (deltaic and estuarine) fauna-rich 
sequence with local carbonate levels. It is the most 
extensive Kimmeridgian unit in the Consolação and 
Bombarral-Alcobaça sub-basins, interfingering with 
the Abadia unit of the Turcifal and Arruda sub-ba-
sins. The Abadia unit is composed mainly of marls, 
limestones, mudstones, and fine sandstones, but also 
includes coarse siliciclastic intervals, forming in the 
southern part of the fieldtrip area an infill sequence of 
basinal to shallow-marine environments due to slope 
and submarine-fan progradation. It is capped by the 
shallow-marine oolitic and reefal Amaral unit.

The Lourinhã Formation and its constituent 
members have been widely used since they were in-
formally proposed by Hill (1988, 1989). Simultane-
ously, Hill’s PhD supervisor (Wilson, 1988, p. 400) 
also used the term “Lourinhã Formation” and depict-
ed it in the lithostratigraphic scheme of the Lusitani-
an Basin. Hill (1988, 1989) includes in the Lourinhã 
Fm. the Praia da Amoreira (erroneously spelled as 
the “Praia da Amoeira” location), Porto Novo, Praia 
Azul, Assenta, and Santa Rita members, comprising 
sandstone and mudstone facies representing braided 
to sinuous paralic fluvial systems, distal alluvial fans, 
and upper deltas, punctuated by episodes of estuarine 
and lagoon sediments with shallow-marine to brack-
ish macrofauna, such as oysters and sea urchins. The 
upper part of the Lourinhã Fm. is fully continental 
to the north of Santa Cruz (Santa Rita Mb. of Hill, 
1989; Ferrel and Areia Branca mbs. of Martinius &amp;amp; 
Gowland, 2011), but it includes transitional to shal-
low-marine intercalations in the Assenta Mb to the 
south of Santa Cruz. As the boundaries between the 
members of the Lourinhã Fm. are essentially trans-
gressive/regressive or retrogradational/progradation-
al transitions, the thicknesses of the units change 

according to the palaeogeographic location, with the 
marine to transitional/brackish deposits increasing in 
proportion southwards along the coastal cliffs. Most 
of the upper Kimmeridgian and Tithonian of the 
Consolação and Arruda sub-basins and the northern 
part of the Lower Tagus Sub-basin corresponds to 
the siliciclastic Lourinhã Fm., progressively replaced 
southwards by the shallow-marine limestones and 
marls of the Farta Pão Fm.

The series of the Lourinhã Formation have always 
been considered as Late Jurassic in age, in particular 
Kimmeridgian/Tithonian (Choffat, 1901; França et 
al., 1961; Hill, 1988, 1989; Manuppella et al., 1999; 
Mateus, 2006; Kullberg et al., 2012, amongst others). 
Currently, this formation is considered as late Kim-
meridgian (as in the Consolação area) to late Tithoni-
an (as in Porto da Calada) in age, based on regional 
correlations, biostratigraphy (namely vertebrate and 
invertebrate faunal assemblages), Sr isotopes, and 
magnetostratigraphy. However, better age resolution 
is hampered by the lack of high-resolution age-index 
fossils or absolute radiometric ages.

1.2. Lithostratigraphic description

 1.2.1. Consolação Unit (sensu Manuppella et 
al., 1999) [member or formation] (Figs. 4–5)
Synonyms or correspondences: After França et 

al. (1960, 1961), the coastal outcrops of this unit cor-
respond to the upper part of the Abadia Beds (sensu 
Choffat). Werner (1986), Hill (1988, 1989), Manup-
pella et al. (1999), Fürsich et al. (2009), and Taylor et 
al. (2013) included this stratigraphic interval in the 
Alcobaça Formation, as did Leinfelder (1986), who 
proposed a member rank but including only the lower 
80 m.

Description: The Consolação unit in the study 
area reaches about 200 m in thickness and has been 
studied in detail by Werner (1986). According to 
that study, the lower 110 m of the unit are dominated 
by marls and sandy marls, with common limestone 
(marly, sandy, oncolitic, oolitic, or nodular) layers, 
and minor sandstone levels. The section from 110 to 
170 m has a balance between sandstones, usually car-
bonate-cemented and cross-bedded, and finer marly 
and mudstone facies, with deformation levels and 
bioturbation but only rare macrofauna or oncoid lev-
els. The upper 30 m are dominated by mudstone with 
abundant caliche concretions, some cross-bedded or 
massive sandstone bodies, rare levels with reworked 
shells and ooids, and abundant plant remains. The top 
is marked by the first coarse fluvial bed.

The marine and brackish beds contain numer-
ous fossil assemblages, which consist mainly of oys-
ter and corals biostromes, bivalves, and gastropods. 
Other macrofaunal groups (ammonites, brachiopods, 
sponges, echinoderms) occur only in a few layers, es-
pecially in the first brackish beds.

Environment: A synthetic analysis of lithologi-
cal and biofacial features (microfacies, sedimenta-

ry structures, microfauna, ichnofauna) by Werner 
(1986), coupled with the stable environmental isotope 
data of Yin et al. (1995), indicates a dominance of 
brackish conditions, with an upward regressive trend 
from a euhaline regime to brachyohaline, meso-
haline, oligohaline, and to a freshwater regime. The 
consolação unit ranges from marine (0–110 m; near-
shore shelf, bay, and distal prodelta) to transitional

(110–170 m; proximal prodelta, delta front ,and upper 
delta) to brackish lagoons. This development can also 
be recognised, albeit less clearly, within the sequence 
of the epibenthic macrofauna, the microfauna (lituol-
id foraminifera to ostracod-dominated assemblages), 
and the ichnofauna (Thalassinoides/Rhizocorallium 
to Diplocraterion/Ophiornorpha/Polykladichnus 
to terrestrial Scoyenia facies). The autochthonous 
macrobenthos associations are controlled mainly 
by substrate and salinity. The diversity is inversely 
proportional to the salinity level, which ranges from 
euhaline to oligohaline waters. The typical brackish 
water environments are dominated by euryhaline op-
portunists or endemic brackish elements (e.g., ?Neo-
miodon). The only association that lived in freshwater 
lakes is represented by the gastropod Valvata.

Age: The 46 to 72 m interval was dated by ammo-
nites as lower Kimmeridgian (Hypselocyclum Zone) 
by Werner (1986). In accordance, the Sr isotope ages 
obtained by Schneider et al. (2009) indicate the early 
to early late Kimmeridgian. Thus the top can be cor-
relative of the eastern Amaral Formation, attributed 
by Leinfelder &amp;amp; Wilson (1998) to the Eudoxus Zone 
(middle of the upper Kimmeridgian) albeit some dia-
chronism can be admitted.

 1.2.2. Praia da Amoreira and Porto Novo 
members (Fig. 6–9)
Synonyms or correspondences: The Porto Novo 

and the Praia da Amoreira Members (Hill, 1989) were 
mapped together by Manuppella et al. (1999) and we 
follow this approach in this work. Since Manuppel-
la et al. (1999) considered this sedimentary pack-
age as part of the Alcobaça Beds, with an implicit 
Formation rank, the Praia da Amoreira–Porto Novo 
unit can be considered as a member. It corresponds 
to the São Bernardino Member of the Lourinhã Fm. 
after Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland (2011), to the lower part 
of the “Pteroceriano” (França et al., 1960, 1961) and 

to the lower part of the Sobral Mb. sensu Fürsich et 
al. (2009).

Description: This stratigraphic interval over-
lies conformably the Consolação unit, but the lower 
boundary seems to be an erosional surface (Ravnas 
et al., 1997; Manuppella et al., 1999) marked by a 
conglomeratic level, already referred by França et al. 
(1961, 1962), possibly related to the progradation of 
the alluvial systems (Hill, 1989). The thickness ap-
pears to change a great deal in the region, with quite 
different numbers mentioned in several publications, 
reaching in the coastal cliffs between S. Bernardino 
and Paimogo 370 m (Werner, 1986) to 340 m (Mar-
tinius &amp;amp; Gowland, 2011); between Areia Branca and 
Porto Novo, Taylor et al. (2013) mention 450 m (but 
including the Praia Azul Mb.), and Hill (1988) refers 
140 m for the Praia da Amoreira Mb. and 95 m for the 
Porto Novo Mb. Silicified and or coalified fossil wood 
(namely the conifers Protocupressinoxylon and Pro-
totaxoxylon, Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland, 2011) and reptile 
bones are relatively frequent in the unit (França et 
al., 1961), especially in the upper Porto Novo Mb. 
(Hill, 1989; Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland, 2011). The abun-
dant coarse pink feldspar or even granite clasts are 
noteworthy, especially at the base of the unit, proving 
a provenance from the Berlengas Horst. The propor-
tion of sandy facies is between 34 and 44%, and the 
trace fossils Taenidium barretti and Planolites mont-
anus are locally common (Taylor et al., 2013).

The Praia da Amoreira Mb. was described in 
detail by Hill (1989) as being formed by sand and 
mudrock heterolithic facies, lenses of meter-thick 
massive sandstone, and massive mudrock with cal-
crete horizons. The mudstone forms about 60% in 
volume, kaolinite dominates among clay minerals, 
and the heterolithic facies show frequent bioturbation 
and soft-sediment deformations (ibid.). At the base a 
slight marine influence was detected by the presence 
of dinocysts (Taylor et al., 2013).

The overlaying Porto Novo Mb. is composed of 
larger bodies of sandstone, often stacked and usual-
ly with lateral accretion surfaces, frequently form-
ing heterolithic wings. Carbonaceous particles are 
frequent in laminae of cross-bedded sandstone. The 
channel sandstone lenses are usually isolated within 
thick floodplain mudstone volumes. The mudrocks 
are rich in calcrete soils, and include also flat lenses 
of finer sandstone of probable crevasse-splay origin. 
Caliche concretions are found as intraformational 
conglomerates at the base of channels. The internal 
architecture of some sandstone bodies points to tidal 
modulation (Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland, 2011). The upper 
50 m was described by Fürsich (1981) in the Amoeiras 
beach as cross-bedded sandstones, sometimes pebbly, 
fining upwards to reddish-greenish floodplain fines.

Environment: The Praia da Amoreiras Mb. was 
interpreted by Hill (1989) as deposited in the distal 
mudflat of alluvial fans with both sheetflood and 
channelized flows shifting on the surface, draining 
southeastward from the Berlengas basement block; 
however, Taylor et al. (2013) consider it as deposited 
by a meandering river system. The Porto Novo Mb. 
comprises distal deposits of a fluvial meander system 
grading laterally to tide-influenced upper deltaic de-
posits with more straight channels, thus including the 
fluvial–tidal transition zone during limited transgres-
sions. Both units show prominent caliche develop-
ment. The palynomorphs associations of two levels of 
this member at Porto Dinheiro (Mohr, 1989) include 
only continental taxa. The Praia da Amoreira–Por-
to Novo unit was deposited in a context of relatively 
high rate of accommodation creation, as inferred by 
the low amalgamation between channel bodies, but 
decreasing upward. Since the alluvial fans were prob-
ably coeval with the fluvial system to the east (Hill, 
1989), the vertical transition corresponds to the pro-
gradation of the axial fluvial drainage over the fans in 
a colmatation trend, possibly in a context of declining 
tectonic activity.

Age: Since it is essentially continental and si-
liciclastic, it does not possesses fossils allowing 
high-resolution age assignment, but it includes ostra-
cods pointing to a late Kimmeridgian to early Titho-
nian age in its middle part (Werner, 1986) and the 
dinocyst Cribroperidinium granuligerum (Klement) 
“complex” indicating a mid Kimmeridgian to late Ti-
thonian age for the lower part (Taylor et al., 2013). 
Thus, the unit is dated as latest Kimmeridgian essen-
tially by considering the encompassing units.

Dino saur fauna: Ceratosaurus sp., Torvosaurus 
gurneyi, Zby atlanticus, Lourinhasaurus alen-

1.2.3. Praia Azul Member (Fig. 8 – 9)

Synonyms or correspondances: This sedimentary 
package was named as Praia Azul Member by Hill 
(1989) and as Porto de Barcas Member by Martinius 
&amp;amp; Gowland (2011, misspelled as Porto de Barças in 
Taylor et al., 2013); both papers include the unit in 
the Lourinhã Fm.. It corresponds to the upper part of 
the “Pteroceriano” in França (1960, 1961), and to the 
Sobral unit of Manuppella et al. (1999). To the south, 
the Praia Azul Mb. corresponds to the Arranhó I Mb. 
and part of the Arranhó II Mb., both from the Farta 
Pão Fm. (sensu Fürsich et al., 2009). Leinfelder (1986) 
considered these series as the Santa Cruz Member 
of the Bombarral Fm. and correlated it with the up-
per part (formed by intercalating laterally extensive 
carbonate layers) of his “Pteroceriano” Formation in 
the Arruda Sub-basin. This unit was later named as 
Arranhó Mb. of the Farta Pão Fm. and the laterally 
extensive carbonates included in sequence 7 by Lein-
felder &amp;amp; Wilson (1998). Note that the Sobral unit was 
considered as a formation by Leinfelder (1986), and 
later as a member of the Lourinhã Fm. by Leinfelder 
&amp;amp; Wilson (1998). According to Fürsich et al. (2009), 
the coastal cliffs between Paimogo and Areia Branca 
are the northernmost identified outcrops of the Arra-
nhó I Mb.

Description: In the cliffs between Paimogo and 
Areia Branca the unit is mainly composed by marls 
and mudstone with a tabular geometry (88 to 75%, 
Taylor et al., 2013), rare sandstone bodies with a

low-relief channel architecture, some displaying in-
tense bioturbation, wave ripples, planar cross-bed-
ding and abundant carbonaceous debris. The unit is 
characterized by three conspicuous carbonate levels, 
with the lower and the upper ones used as the litho-
stratigraphic boundaries. These faunally distinct, lat-
erally extensive shelly layers can be traced over dis-
tances of 20 km, with a brackish bivalve association 
(Werner, 1986; Taylor et al., 2013) and including lo-
cally at the base some bivalve patch-reefs mentioned 
by Seifert (1958, cited in França et al., 1961). This unit 
was described by Fürsich (1981), namely the lower 85 
m between Santa Cruz and the Sizandro river mouth, 
detailing the characteristic banks and patch-reefs of 
benthic macrofauna. It is also rich in bioturbated lev-
els, including the widespread Taenidium barretti and 
Planolites montanus and diverse trace fossils assem-
blages in the shelly beds, this comprising Thalassi-
noides, Rhizocorallium and Diplocraterion species, 
among others (Manuppella et al., 1999, Taylor et al., 
2013). Horizons of carbonate palaeosols (caliche lev-
els) are frequent in the mudstones. After Manuppella 
et al. (1999) south of Santa Cruz the unit is composed 
by ca. 130 m of sandstones with some conglomeratic 
layers, occasionally with large-scale cross bedding, 
alternating silty or sandy to clayey marls and mud-
stone. Further north it reaches about 80 m in Santa 
Rita (Wilson, 1979) and 110 m in the cliffs between 
Paimogo and Areia Branca (Fürsich, 1981; Taylor et 
al., 2013). Dinocysts forms diverse assemblages and 
some foraminifers, ostracods and charophytes were 
identified by Taylor et al. (2013).

In the Paimogo to Areia Branca coastal cliffs the 
overlaying predominantly meandering deposits cor-
responds: i) to the upper part of the Porto Novo Mb. 
after Hill (1989) (implying that the Praia Azul Mb. 
is an intercalation within this unit), ii) to the Areia 
Branca Mb. after Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland (2011), or iii) 
to the Bombarral Fm. in Manuppella et al. (1999).

Environment: Most of the unit was deposited by 
meandering fluvial systems flowing in a low-lying 
coastal plain, connected with transitional systems 
like deltas, sandy bay shorelines and brackish lagoons 
(Fürsich, 1981; Werner, 1986; Taylor et al., 2013). The 
fine deposits of paralic floodplains and restricted la-
goons are thicker than channels bodies, both fluvial 
and deltaic.

The brackish faunas of the shelly layers indi-
cate brief marine incursions (Werner, 1986) forming 
brackish–marine bays, an interpretation supported 
by stable isotope data (Yin et al., 1995). In general, 

a regressive trend can be identified, continuing in the 
overlying coarser braided fluvial deposits of the Santa 
Rita Mb. (of the Lourinhã Fm).

Age: In the fieldtrip area the unit was considered 
by Fürsich (1981) as upper Kimmeridgian–lower Ti-
thonian due to the presence of the ostracod Cetacella 
armata Martin in the lower–middle part of the unit. It 
includes the bed with Protocardia gigantea that marks, 
according to Schneider et al. (2010b), the Kimmeridg-
ian–Tithonian boundary in the Lusitanian Basin.

The biostratigraphy based in a combination of fo-
rams, ostracods and dinocysts presented by Taylor et 
al. (2013) indicates for the two lower shelly levels a 
latest Kimmeridgian to earliest Tithonian age (teth-
yan ammonites Beckeri and Hybonotum Zones).

By plotting the strontium isotopes data from oys-
ter shells in the established global curves, Schneider 
et al. (2009) provide reliable ages for shallow-marine 
to brackish units interfingering with the Lourinhã 
Fm., namely latest upper Kimmeridgian to middle 
lower Tithonian for the Arranhó I Mb. (probably the 
upper part) in the Santa Cruz area. This view agrees 
with the correlations established with the Arruda 
Sub-basin by Leinfelder (1986) and Leinfelder &amp;amp; 
Wilson (1998), where the transition from the Sobral 
unit to the expressive transgressive level at the base 
of the Arranhó unit was dated as earliest Tithonian.

In conclusion, the Praia Azul/Sobral Member can 
be considered with confidence as latest Kimmeridg-
ian to earliest Tithonian.

Dinosaur fauna: Supersaurus lourinhanensis 
(holotype, ML414), Lourinhanosaurus antunesi 
(holotype ML370), Lusotitan atalaiensis (lectotype, 
MG), Miragaia longicollum, Dryosaurus sp., Al-
losaurus europaeus (holotype, ML415), Draconyx 
loureiroi (holotype).

Other vertebrates: Plesiochelyidae, Pleuroster-
nidae Selesemys, Goniopholis, Machimosaurus, Hy-
dodus. Sites with microvertebrate remains show the 
occurrence of anurans, albanerpetontids, bony fishes, 
plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, lizards, early snakes, small 
crocodyliforms, and mammaliforms.

Invertebrates: Jurassicorbula edwardsi, Isogno-
mon rugosa, Eomiodon securiformes, Archaeomyti-
lus, Ostreiidae, Protocardia gigantea.

Flora: Porochara westerbeckensis.

Cruz), to the Santa Rita Mb. (after Hill, 1989), and to 
the association of the Areia Branca plus Ferrel mem-
bers of Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland (2011), all included in 
the Lourinhã Fm.. It is also synonymous of the Bom-
barral Formation in Manuppella et al. (1999), of the 
Portlandian in França et al. (1961) and Zbyszewski et 
al. (1955), and correspond to most of the upper sand-
stones with plants and dinosaurs (“Grés superiores 
com vegetais e dinossáurios”) in França et al. (1960). 
It intertongues laterally to the east and to the south 
with the Farta Pão Fm ( pars).

Description: The unit is dominated by mud-
stones, with frequent levels of pedogenic carbonate 
concretions (caliche), intercalated with channelized 
cross-bedded sandstones, including large scale point-
bars, and thin flat lenses (almost tabular) crevasse 
and levees bodies. It includes several levels of nod-
ular and marly bioclastic limestones, with a diverse 
bivalve fauna (Zbyszewski et al., 1955), benthic fo-
raminifera and ostracods (Rey, 1972) that can be con-
sidered as tongues of the Farta Pão Fm. thinning out 
northward. The caliche levels can be well developed, 
even forming resistance belts in the cliffs. Reworked 
nodules often constitute conglomerates at the base of 
channels. Carbonaceous fragments are common, fre-
quently as trunks and pyritized. Deformation struc-
tures, namely load-casts and slumps, are recurrent. 
The top boundary of the unit is defined by the transi-
tion from a mudstone dominated interval to the sand-
stone-rich with thin micritic and dolomitic layers of 
the Porto da Calada Formation, marked in detail by 
a thick sandstone channel body (in accordance with 
Rey, 1993).

The carbonate intercalations of the upper part of 
the unit (around 20 and 40 m in Fig. 11) include lam-
inated marls, and limestones with a marked nodular 
characteristic resulting from intense Thalassinoides 
ichnofabric, a facies typical of the Farta Pão unit fur-
ther south (Ramalho, 1971).

It is difficult to give the unit’s exact thickness, 
since the base is covered and affected by faults, but it 
can be estimated around 300 m (Wilson, 1979; Hill, 
1988). The dominant clay minerals association is il-
lite–smectite (Manuppella et al., 1999).

Age: According to Rey (1972) the microfossil 
association (foraminifera and ostracods) of the top-
most marine limestone intercalation in the Porto da 
Calada section (37–40 m in Fig. 11) is similar to the 
one found in the Farta Pão Fm. (dated as latest Kim-
meridgian to latest Tithonian, Schneider et al., 2009), 
including the foraminifera Anchispiroyclina lusitani-
ca (Egger) and Everticyclammina virguliana (Koech-
lin) indicating in the region, respectively, a late early 
Tithonian to Berriasian and a late Oxfordian to Ti-
thonian age (Rey, 1972; Ramalho, 1981). This agrees 
well with the ages admitted to the enclosing units and 
with the lateral correlations with the southern marine 
units (e.g., Leinfelder &amp;amp; Wilson, 1998; Fürsich et al., 
2009) and the unit should be essentially Tithonian. In 
detail, the upper carbonate level of the Assenta Mb. 
in the Porto da Calada section is quite likely the up-
per tongue of the Freixial Mb. of the Farta Pão Fm. 
in the Arruda Sub-basin, correlated by Leinfelder &amp;amp; 
Wilson (1998) with the base of the latest Tithonian 
T5 sequence of the European Sequence Stratigraphic 
Chart of Jacquin et al. (1998).

Considering its own age arguments and the age 
admitted for the units above and below, a late early 
Tithonian to earlier Berriasian age can be proposed 
for the unit. Bearing this in mind, the recent magneto-
stratigraphic study conducted by Salminen et al. (2013) 
tentatively identified the M19 to M17 magnetochrons in 
the polarity log of the Porto da Calada section. Follow-
ing the Ogg et al. (2012) scale, the J/K Tithonian–Ber-
riasian boundary is at the base of magnetozone M18r, 
around 52 m in the Porto da Calada section (Fig. 11). 
After this work the last few meters of the Assenta Mb. 
can be considered as earliest Berriasian.

Environment: Upper fluvial-dominated delta to 
meandering fluvial systems flowing in a paralic plain 
(Hill, 1988), with occasional transgressions allowing 
the short-lived establishment of inner and restrict-
ed (lagoonal) zones of shallow carbonate platforms 
(Ramalho, 1981). The overall trend is regressive (Hill 
1988), as marked by the siliciclastic facies and archi-
tecture, as well as the fauna of the carbonates chang-
ing from marine to brackish. Accordingly, Martinius 
&amp;amp; Gowland (2011) interpreted the further north Areia 
Branca Mb. as recording paralic meandering fluvial to 
upper delta systems (including tidal modulation and 
mouth-bars), grading upward to the pebbly sandstones 
of braided systems that forms the Ferrel Mb..

1.2.5. Porto da Calada Formation (Figs. 10–11)

Synonyms or correspondences: The Porto da Ca-
lada Formation was formally defined by Rey (1993). 
It is laterally equivalent to the north and to the east 
to the fluvial Serreira Formation (op. cit.) and to the 
south, in the Sintra region, to the limestones and 
marls with Anchispirocyclina lusitanica, Mantellia-
na purbeckensis and Trocholina, including the “nan-
keen-yellow limestone levels” (“Infravalanginian”) 
(Ramalho et al., 1993). It corresponds to the top of 
the Farta Pão Formation (sensu Wilson, 1988) and to 
the uppermost part of the Feixial unit, considered as 
a formation by Leinfelder (1986) and as a member of 
the Farta Pão Formation by Fürsich et al. (2009). It is 
equivalent to the lower part (C.1–5) of the “Hauterivian 
and Valanginian” of Zbyszewski et al. (1955) to the 
NE.

Description: In the Porto da Calada section, the 
unit was studied by Rey (1972, 1993) and Salmin-
en et al. (2013). It is 43 m thick and is dominated by 
cross-bedded sandstones, often conglomeratic, with 
minor mudstones. The sandstone bodies usually show 
lateral accretion sigmoids, sometimes heterolithic, 
and include several amalgamated channels; reworked 
calcrete nodules forms breccia-like conglomerates at 
the base of the larger channels. The overbank mud-
stones include frequent laminae of fine sandstone and 
calcrete levels. The carbonate levels are micritic lime-
stone with gastropods and bivalves (namely the bivalve 
Pterotrigonia caudata (see Rey, 1972), and dolomitic 
facies, including thin nodular yellowish beds at the 
top. Several limestone levels along the unit shows the 
large foraminifera Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. 

Age: The unit was dated as Berriasian based on 
dinocysts (Berthou &amp;amp; Leereveld, 1990) and correlated 
with the top of the Farta Pão and Freixial units, both 

also considered as Berriasian based on foraminifera, 
ostracods and charophytes (Ramalho, 1971; Rey, 
1972), namely by including the foram Anchispirocy-
clina lusitanica, indicating a Tithonian to lowermost 
Cretaceous age (Ramalho, 1981; Leinfelder, 1986). 
About 2.5 km to the south of Porto da Calada the unit 
shows an increase in the proportion of marginal ma-
rine beds and a more diverse fossil association, in-
cluding in the lower levels the bivalve Pterotrigonia 
caudata in Rey (1972) that indicates the Early Cre-
taceous. In the magnetostratigraphic study recently 
conducted in the Porto da Calada section (Salminen

et al., 2013), considering the biostratigraphic con-
straints, the Tithonian–Berriasian boundary (at the 
base of magnetozone M18r) was tentatively located at 
51–53 m (Fig. 11), about 5 m below the limit between 
the Assenta Mb. and the Porto da Calada Fm.

Environment: Rey (1993) identified five 3rd or-
der depositional sequences, with late transgressive 
to highstand intervals represented by carbonate and 
laminated fine sandstone beds deposited in intertidal 
plains to internal marine platform. The lowstand to 
early transgressive systems correspond essentially to 
sandy meandering fluvial channels, linked to estua-
rine channels and bars, interbedded and cutting the 
floodplain and intertidal flats (Rey, 1993; Salminen et 
al., 2013). These low energy deposits had developed 
paleosols, as shown by the in situ and the reworked 
calcrete nodules. Batten &amp;amp; MacLennan (1984) stud-
ied ten samples of the Porto da Calada section with 
large assemblages of well preserved palynomorphs, 
dominated by a high diversity of Classopollis pollen 
but with a low representation of ferns. The associ-
ations were interpreted as reflecting a source vege-
tation composed by conifers, mainly of the Cheiro-
lepidiaceae family, with a sparse undergrowth.

1.2.6. Palaeoclimatic interpretation

The interest in palaeoclimate in the scope of this 
work is twofold: as main control on i) palaeoecolo-
gy and palaeoenvironment, and on ii) vertebrates 
taphonomy, namely on the preservation of bones in 
the stratigraphic record. Paleosols are relevant since 
they are controlled by precipitation, temperature and 
seasonality, as well as they are major contributes for 
the geochemical environment of burial areas.

Calcretes, found in the Lourinhã Fm. (Myers, 
2011) and the Porto da Calada Fm. (Rey, 1993; Salm-
inen et al., 2013), indicate a semi-arid climate with a 
seasonal rainfall lower than 500 mm and mean annu-
al temperature from 16 to 19 °C. Myers et al. (2012a) 
estimated the soil pCO2 by measuring carbon-iso-
tope values of pedogenic carbonates and plant-de-
rived organic matter. The Lourinhã Fm. has a slightly 
higher average estimates for soil pCO2 when com-
pared with the coeval Morrison Formation, implying 
for the Lourinhã Formation a deposition under some-
how wetter conditions, higher productivity and an 
estimated greater faunal richness. After Myers et al., 
(2012b), the geochemistry and morphology of paleo-
sols profiles show warm and wet paleoclimatic con-
ditions with a strongly seasonal precipitation pattern, 
and the oxygen isotopes suggest surface temperatures 

reaching between 27º C and 34º C (average 31ºC) and 
a mean annual precipitation of 1100 mm/yr. 

The plant macroremains of the Upper Jurassic in 
the study area (Pais, 1998) include as the most com-
mon forms the bennetittale Otozamites and the coni-
fer Cupressinocladus, which have aridity adaptation 
as thick cuticles and strongly protected stomata, sug-
gesting a warm and dry climate. After Mohr (1989) 
the middle part of the Lourinhã Formation (Porto 
Novo Mb.) at Porto Dinheiro holds an exclusively 
continental e relatively diverse palynological assem-
blage suggesting a warm climate with pronounced 
dry seasons, possibly of Mediterranean type.

The dominance of the cheirolepidiaceous Clas-
sopolis pollen in the Porto da Calada Fm. (Batten 
&amp;amp; MacLennan, 1984) probably indicates a prefer-
ence for dry conditions, at least seasonally (op. cit., 
Mendes et al., 2010). After Mendes et al. (2011) the 
probably coeval (latest Tithonian?–Berriasian) upper 
part of the Bombarral Fm. in the Juncal–Nazaré re-
gion bears palaeobotanical associations indicating a 
xerophytic coniferous forest dominated by Cheiro-
lepidiaceae with an understory vegetation of ferns 
typical of dry soils and other pteridophytes, as well 
as members of the BEG group, a community clearly 
adapted to a subtropical and (at least seasonally) dry 
palaeoclimate. However, as pointed out by Leinfelder 
et al. (2004), a fully arid climate can be ruled out by 
humid indicators like the frequent meandering riv-
er, delta, freshwater and brackish systems, as well as 
abundant lignite-rich deposits.

Martinius &amp;amp; Gowland (2011) run a palaeoclimat-
ic model developed by the Hadley Centre (Bristol, 
UK) applied on a Statoil plate reconstruction (in-
house MERLIN project data), as well as interpreted 
the growth rings and cellular structure of the conifers 
trunks found in the Porto Novo Mb. as revealing con-
trasting growing conditions probably due to seasonal 
changes in water availability. According to the same 
paper, these arguments, coupled with the abundant cal-
cretes, indicate a warm climate marked by a seasonal 
change from a dry summer with a dominant WSW 
palaeowind, to a wet winter with ENE palaeowind. 
This characterization suggests a monsoonal pattern 
and agrees well with the above referred interpretations.

1.3. Dinosaurs and other vertebrates

The Lourinhã Fm. become famous by their di-
nosaurs, which include some taxon names based on 
the toponomy: Lourinhanosaurus antunesi Mateus, 
1998, Lourinhasaurus alenquerensis (Lapparent &amp;amp; 



89

O. Mateus, et al., Ciências da Terra / Earth Sciences Journal 19 (1), 2017, 75-97

Zbyszewski, 1957), and  Supersaurus lourinhanensis 
Bonaparte &amp;amp; Mateus 1999 (see Mannion et al., 2012 
and Tschopp et al., 2015). Besides the skeletal materi-
al, the Lourinhã Fm. yielded also abundant dinosaur 
tracks, normally preserved by the natural sandstone 
infill in the muddy substrate (e.g., Milàn et al., 2005; 
Mateus &amp;amp; Milàn, 2008, 2010), and eggs and nests 
(e.g., Mateus et al., 1998; Cunha et al., 2004).

The vertebrates fossils are common, including 
dinosaurs, crocodiles, and turtles (Mateus, 2006), a 
fauna assemblage somehow similar to the Morrison 
Formation in North America, but with coastal in-
fluence and some European-related fauna input. In 
particular, the dinosaur fauna shares several genera, 
such as Ceratosaurus, Torvosaurus and Allosaurus 
(Mateus &amp;amp; Antunes, 2000a, 2000b). 

The nest at Porto das Barcas is in the Praia Azul 
Member that corresponds to a transgressive episode 
with euryhaline bivalves and rare sea urchins, but 
also including dinosaur bones and tracks, and oth-
er continental fossils (see, for example, Mateus &amp;amp; 
Milàn, 2010). The Lourinhã Fm. is also one of the 
richest areas for Late Jurassic dinosaur and crocodile 
eggs, which are mainly concentrated in Praia Azul 
Member (Ribeiro et al., 2013). The nests of Porto das 
Barcas and Paimogo provide exquisitely preserved 
eggs and embryos of theropod dinosaurs (Mateus et 
al., 1998; Araújo et al., 2013).

1.4. Paleogeography

Most of the Late Jurassic paleogeographic re-
constructions indicate a marine separation between 
Iberia (Portugal and Spain) and North America pri-
or to the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian (Figs. 12 and 13; 
Mouterde et al., 1979; Ribeiro et al., 1979; Ziegler, 
1988; Schudack &amp;amp; Schudack, 1989; Smith et al., 1994; 
Rees et al., 2004; Golonka, 2005). The paleogeogra-
phy of the European margin (Ziegler, 1988; Schudack 
&amp;amp; Schudack, 1989; Sibuet et al., 2012) indicates that 
Iberia was separated from continental Europe as well 
as from North America by seaways, but several is-
lands occurred between the Iberian western margin 
and Newfoundland, namely the Galicia Banks, the 
Great Banks and the Flemish cap blocks. If we con-
sider emerged and shallow coastal areas, the recon-
structions do not preclude transient and temporary 
terrestrial connections during eustatic lowstands.

The early stages of the Atlantic can be traced back 
to the Hettangian, when separation begun between 
North America and the Iberian. The Lower Jurassic 
rocks of the Lusitanian Basin show ammonites and 
clear marine deposition. By the Late Jurassic, when a 
large part of the Lourinhã Fm. rocks were deposited, 
the proto-Atlantic was already a few hundred of kilo-
meters wide at this paleolatitude. 

However, the presence of shared large vertebrates 
propose a land connection palaeogeographical North

America and Iberia. The dinosaurs Torvosaurus, Al-
losaurus, Ceratosaurus, Stegosaurus, Supersaurus, 
brachiosaurids and others have a restricted distri-
bution Morrison Formation in North America and 
Lourinhã Fm. in Portugal. As mentioned before, nu-
merous dinosaurs show faunal similarities with the 
Kimmeridgian/Tithonian Morrison Fm. in North 
America. Taking in consideration that the dinosaur 
usual generic longevity is below 10 Myr (the aver-
age is 7.7 Myr according to Dodson, 1990), the origin 
of the several genera shared between Portugal and 
Morrison Fm. should had occurred during the late 
Middle Jurassic to early Late Jurassic. This is much 
more recent than the early Jurassic first marine pro-
to-Atlantic sediments in the Lusitanian Basin. Some 
land passages between the Iberian Block and North 
America must have occurred during the Callovian–
Kimmeridgian interval. The most significant regres-
sion and sea-level drop during that interval is latest 
Callovian to early Oxfordian and may have allowed 
the passage of terrestrial fauna between Iberia and 
North America. An Oxfordian timing for a possible 
migration of dinosaur fauna is consistent with the ex-
pected diversity and speciation observed in the Late 
Jurassic fauna of Portugal.

During the Late Jurassic, especially the late Kim-
meridgian and the Tithonian, major eustatic changes 
(Haq et al., 1988; Sahagian et al., 1996) could have 
alternatingly increased the isolation of Iberia conti-

nental areas and contributed to speciation, or allowed 
the connection and spreading of terrestrial taxa.

By the Callovian–Oxfordian transition between 
there was a major paleoceanographic and paleocli-
mate reorganization (Rais et al., 2007) coincident 
with a large drop of the eustatic sea level, exposure 
and unconformity (Leinfelder &amp;amp; Wilson 1998; Kull-
berg et al., 2014) and associated with the Callovian–
Oxfordian Atlantic Regressive Event. That condition 
created an ephemeral land bridge that presented a 
temporary opportunity for probably terrestrial gate-
ways through the landmasses Flemish Cap and Gali-
cian Bank, so that large dinosaur could cross the 
northern proto-Atlantic in both directions. Finally, 
the time between the fauna exchange of Callovian–
Oxfordian around 163 Ma until the occurrences in 
late Kimmeridgian at 152 Ma in Morrison and Portu-
gal, was sufficient to allow speciation but keep gener-
ic resemblance. That explains why most genera are 
shared but species are unique.

This model is consistent with the chronology and 
taxonomy for speciation of Iberian and American 
forms, exemplified by pairs coeval sister taxa Tor-
vosaurus tanneri and T. gurneyi, Allosaurus fragilis 
and A. europaeus or Supersaurus vivianae and S. 
lourinhanensis.

While some of the smaller animals in the fauna 
show Morrison/Portugal affinities (Saurillodon, Dor-
setisaurus, Dryolestes, Laolestes), most from Iberia

have European or even Asian affinities (as for Aster-
acanthus, Caturus, Craspedochelys, Paulchoffatinae, 
Plesiochelys, and Rhamphorhynchus). The larger bod-
ied fauna is more closely related to Morrison than to 
mainland Europe (except for dacentrurine stegosaurs). 

The migration may have taken place in both direc-
tions. For instance, the closest relative of Torvosaurus 
is probably the Bathonian European Megalosaurus that 
the presence of this genus in North America suggests 
an European origin. On the other hand, Allosaurus 
and Supersaurus origins are consistent with a North 
American origin and with an east–west migration.

1.5. Vertebrates taphonomy

The landscape of the studied units, where dino-
saurs lived, had a variety of environments with a wet 
and soft muddy surface, mainly fluvial floodplains, 
deltaic interdistributary areas, intertidal plains and 
shallow coastal lagoons. Many of such places could 
turn into mires where animals weakened by a pro-
longed dry season may have been trapped and died 
(Benton et al., 2012). The sudden and violent flash-
floods typical of the hydrological regimes of mediter-
ranean or monsoonal climates can also be evoked to 
explain the burial of skeletons and nests.

After its burial, the preservation of the bones and 
eggshells depends on the diagenetic geochemical 
conditions. We believe that the vertebrate richness of 
the upper Kimmeridgian, Tithonian and Berriasian 
of the Portuguese western margin (namely the Alco-
baça, Lourinhã, Bombarral and Porto da Calada for-
mations) results from the particular conditions below 
mentioned that favors fossilization.

Rock-body hydrology: bone decay is directly re-
lated with the fluid circulation in the enclosing rock 
massif. Thus, preservation is favored by impermea-
ble material or larger-scale hydraulic confinement. 
In fact, most of the Portuguese Upper Jurassic ver-
tebrate sites are either in lutitic deposits or sand bod-
ies isolated within muddy sediments, thus with very 
reduced hydraulic connection. For instance, the most 
productive unit, the Porto Novo Mb. of the Lourinhã 
Fm., corresponds to sandy channels or set of amalga-
mated channels isolated within thick floodplain and 
paleosols volumes.

Carbonate availability: There is a direct correla-
tion between pH and bone preservation (e. g. White 
&amp;amp; Hannus, 1983), since one of most important fac-
tors promoting bone decay is an acidic environment. 
The pH is raised by carbonate-rich waters like those 
found in most of the Portuguese Upper Jurassic, due 

to the presence of limestone layers (e.g., the Con-
solação, Praia Azul, Assenta and Porto da Calada 
units) and or the frequent occurrence of widespread 
and well developed caliche/calcrete levels (like the 
Porto Novo, Assenta and Porto da Calada units). This 
is particularly relevant in units with abundant coal, 
since it counteracts the acidification promoted by the 
formation of sulfuric acid during the hydro-oxidation 
of the pyrite fixed in coal. 

The preservational effect of carbonate ions is 
clear when we compare the stratigraphic distribu-
tion of vertebrates in the Upper Jurassic and Ber-
riasian vs. the remaining Lower Cretaceous of Por-
tugal (Antunes &amp;amp; Mateus, 2003). In fact, the lower 
interval is rich in calcrete paleosols and vertebrate 
remains (see above), whereas the upper one lacks 
caliche layers (Rey et al., 2006), due to a wetter cli-
mate (Mendes et al., 2010; Heimhofer et al., 2012), 
and bears bones only in units with marginal marine 
limestone layers. Even in the Upper Jurassic conti-
nental to transitional units, when limestone or pe-
dogenic carbonate nodules (caliche) are rare, verte-
brate bones are also scarce. This correlation should 
have same causality.

2. Field Trip – Upper Jurassic to Lowermost Cre-
taceous of the Lusitanian Basin

 2.1. Stop 1. Consolação Unit, Alcobaça Fm. 
(upper Kimmeridgian, mixed siliciclastic–car-
bonate, with the earlier record of dinosaurs 
from the area). Consolação - Porto Batel beach; 
Coordinates: N 39.31º; W 9.35º

The NE dipping Consolação section between 
Consolação and Areia Branca is 740 m thick and was 
studied by Werner (1986), with particular detail in the 
lower 200 m interpreted as deposited in calm and pro-
tected environments of shallow-marine or brackish 
bays and lagoons. The same work divided the detailed 
section in a lower part dominated by carbonates with 
minor sandstones of open lagoon, bay and nearshore 
shelf (lower 107 m), followed by a sandy and muddy 
dominated interval (107 to 172 m) of delta and delta 
front environments. Mudstone and minor sandstone 
sediments of brackish lagoons constitute the 172 to 
200 m of the detailed log of Werner (1986). 

The transition from the lower carbonate dominated 
sector (towards north) to the sandy/marly/muddy deltaic 
interval outcrops at the Porto Batel beach (Fig. 4).

Invertebrates, ichnofacies and dinosaur tracks 
show a shallow and nearshore palaeo-setting. Sand-

stone bodies are frequently channelized and show 
diverse paleocurrents, with herringbone character, 
revealing probable tidal influence. Reworked caliche 
nodules occur in the channel sandstones. 

Here are visible the older dinosaur tracks of the 
this section of the Lusitanian Basin, as natural infills 
and skin striations (in levels 116 to 123 m of the sec-
tion by Werner, 1986; Fig. 5B). This kind of dino-
saur tracks preservation, as natural infills, is common 
in the Lourinhã Fm. (Milàn et al., 2005). The lower 
bone remain is a Crocodylomorpha vertebra, about 
10 m above the dinosaur track presented in Fig. 5B.

 2.2. Stop 2. Paimogo (Kimmeridgian/Tithonian 
boundary, dinosaur-rich series); Coordinates: N 
39.28º; W 9.34º

This second fieldtrip stop at the Paimogo fort (also 
erroneously spelled Pai Mogo in some scientific liter-
ature) shows the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian transition 
within the Lourinhã Fm. and one of the richest areas 
for dinosaurs and other terrestrial vertebrates in the 
Upper Jurassic of Portugal and Europe. Two mem-
bers are well exposed: the older Praia da Amoreira 
and Porto Novo members. towards north (Fig. 6 and 
7) underlies the Praia Azul Mb. to the south (Fig. 8 
and 9). The dinosaur sites are located at the top of 
the Porto Novo Mb., where in situ developed calcrete 
paleosols and reworked caliche nodules are frequent, 
namely in the vertebrate-rich beds (Fig. 7), which 
may relate a more basic groundwater geochemistry 
with bone preservation. 

The highlight of vertebrate findings in Paimogo 
includes an important dinosaur nest with embryos 
(Mateus et al., 1998; Ricqlès et al., 2001; Cunha et 
al., 2004) of the theropod dinosaur Lourinhanosaur-
us antunesi Mateus, 1998. Moreover, Paimogo is the 
type-locality of the multituberculate mammal Kueh-
neodon hahni Antunes, 1998 and the provenance 
of the sauropod dinosaur Zby atlanticus Mateus et 
al., 2014. A couple of kilometers further south, at 
the shoreline, Vale Frades (Praia Azul Mb.) is the 
type-locality for the theropod Allosaurus europaeus 
Mateus et al. (2006) and the ornithopod Draconyx 
loureiroi Mateus &amp;amp; Antunes, 2001. 

 2.3. Stop 3. Museum of Lourinhã – Overview of 
dinosaur and other fauna; Coordinates: N 39.24º; 
W 9.31º

The Museum of Lourinhã, in Portugal, has a rich 
palaeontology collection (Mateus, 2010), particularly 

of Late Jurassic dinosaurs of the Lourinhã Formation 
(Kimmeridgian–Tithonian). Most salient highlights 
comprehend the following dinosaur holotype spec-
imens: stegosaur Miragaia longicollum, theropod 
Lourinhanosaurus antunesi, sauropod Supersaurus 
lourinhanensis, ornithopod Draconyx loureiroi, 
theropod Allosaurus europaeus, as well as the holo-
type of the mammal Kuehneodon hahni. Other dino-
saur specimens deserving a mention include the nest 
with eggs and embryos of Lourinhanosaurus. We be-
lieve that this collection proves that Portugal is very 
productive in Late Jurassic vertebrates, being within 
the top ten countries bearing more dinosaur taxa.

 2.4. Stop 4. Porto da Calada (J/K boundary, 
with dinosaur occurrences); Coordinates: N 
39.04º; W 9.41º

The stop at the Praia da Escadinha coastal cliff, 
north of Porto da Calada, allows the observation of 
the Assenta Mb. (Lourinhã Fm., late early Tithoni-
an to earlier Berriasian) and the Porto da Calada Fm. 
(Berriasian).

The Assenta Mb. (Lourinhã Fm.) outcrop is 
mainly composed by floodplain mudstone containing 
calcrete levels and thin lenses of bioturbated sand-
stone of crevasse-splay origin. Crossbedded channel 
sandstone bodies have a sigmoidal to oblique internal 
architecture and bears frequent concentrations of re-
worked caliche nodules. Coalified plant remains are 
abundant and thin dolomitic beds or nodules align-
ments occurs. Two levels of nodular limestone and 
marls with some bivalves show a tabular geometry 
along the cliff, allowing a good correlation between 
two logged sections.

The Porto da Calada Formation includes several 
positive sequences composed of medium to coarse 
crossbedded sandstones, sometimes with reworked 
caliche nodules, followed by mudstone including fine 
sandstone lenses, coal, horizontal laminations, ripple 
marks and bioturbation, culminating in carbonate 
beds composed by yellow dolomicrites or gray lime-
stones with gastropods, bivalves and the foraminifer 
Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. Such deposits represent 
sedimentation in intertidal environments and mean-
dering rivers crossing a coastal plain (Rey, 1993).

Besides some dinosaur tracks, the only vertebrate 
remains from this section are a couple of recent find-
ings of dinosaur bones made by the geologist Vasco 
Ribeiro, and here reported. The first is a specimen 
of a stegosaur osteoderm, more precisely a stegosaur 
tail spine, ascribed to Stegosaurus sp. and found at 



93

O. Mateus, et al., Ciências da Terra / Earth Sciences Journal 19 (1), 2017, 75-97

Escadinha, a few meters above the base of Porto da 
Calada Formation and near layers with the foram A. 
lusitanica. The specimen here reported has the dis-
tinctive morphology of stegosaur spines: a spear-like 
elongated osteoderm with acute point and expanded 
oblique base, normally with foramina at the base and 
superficial interwoven bone fibers structures. The 
parascapular spines normally have a wide base, of-
ten with lateral flanges, while caudal spines have 
moderated expansions at the continuity of the spine 
body. The fusiform outline of the cross section of 
the tail spine (specimen ML1920) differs from the 
most common stegosaur Miragaia longicollum Ma-
teus et al., 2009 that presents an inverted S-shaped 
section, and is seen commonly in the stegosaurines 
such as the Stegosaurus, rare in Portugal (Escaso et 
al., 2007) but widespread in the Morrison Forma-
tion. This confirms the presence of Stegosaurinae 
in the Early Cretaceous of Europe and is the only 
Berriasian vertebrate fossil in Portugal, thus the 
oldest vertebrate occurrence within the Portuguese 
Cretaceous.

The second specimen (FCT-UNL 702) is a part-
ly articulated ankylosaur found below the top of the 
Assenta Mb. The specimen is tentatively ascribed to 
‘polacanthid’ nodosaurid but the laboratorial prepara-
tion is still in progress. Ankylosaurs are very rare in 
Portugal and the only specimen is the holotype of the 
poorly known Dracopelta zbyszewskii Galton, 1980.
