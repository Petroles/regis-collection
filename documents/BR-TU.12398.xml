ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

 

There are many people I'd like to thank. This work, as all scientific studies, didn't 

come from just one person, it's the result of the work and dedication of many, many 

people. 

Firstly, the one person to actually give me the idea to do this project, Dr Mark 

Fernandez. You said I'd feel like hitting you for giving me this idea and I'd feel 

frustrated and desperate at some point and I just laughed, but I want to tell you that you 

were so, so right. It really was a good idea though, so thanks anyway. 

I owe a special thanks Dr Colin MacLeod for all the help you gave me, the advice 

and replies to all those emails I sent, thank you so much for your patience and kindness. 

Without your help these maps would have never seen the light of day. 

I would also like to thank the Sea Watch Foundation staff and volunteers for 

gathering all the data throughout the years, specially the 2017 volunteers for period 1. 

Those many days at sea and on landwatch were very important for keeping my sanity 

when computer work started. A very special thanks to Rhodri  and Steph for the help 

with the Arc GIS program, without you I don't know how I would have done those 

damned maps. 

To Professor Peter Evans and Katrin Lohrengel from the SWF for supervising and 

providing all the data necessary for this study to happen. A big thanks for professora 

Ester Serrão from UAlg for looking at my draft. 

To everyone at the MBM in UAlg, particularly Monica, Maya, Inês and Teo for 

all the help with the exams and presentations we did and for all the fun we had.  

To my favourite cousin, Olivier for the help with my computer issues. 

A very very heartfelt thanks to whoever wrote the website 

http://abacus.bates.edu/~ganderso/biology/resources/writing/HTWsections.html, thank 

you so much, you are awesome!! 

A great thanks for all the dolphins who let themselves be photographed by the 

SWF, believe it or not some of them were not very good dolphins and wouldn't let us 

photograph them, so those who did deserve all the affection I have for them, especially 

the ones bow ridding and staying close to the boat for a long time, they are really nice 

good dolphins.  

Lastly, to those people that lost hours and days, if not weeks, trying to give all the 

help they could, for putting up with me all those years, my parents and my brother. It 



iii 
 

was never easy, I know, but they say the hardest things in life are the best. If we all had 

to choose a family, I'd never hesitate to choose you three. Thank you for all the support, 

all the worries you had for me, for letting me scuba dive and drive my motorbike and all 

that crazy stuff I wanted to do. Most importantly for the support when I was eight and 

told you I wanted to be a marine biologist. You didn't laugh or said I shouldn't do it, you 

just supported and encouraged me and I thank the ocean every day for the gift I was 

given to be part of your family. 

To all this people and maybe some that I'm forgetting, thank you for all the help.

 ABSTRACT 

 

The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) belongs to 

the sub-order Odontoceti and is one of the most widely distributed species of cetaceans. 

Within this species it is possible to find strict resident populations, semi-resident 

populations or transient communities. The Cardigan Bay bottlenose dolphin population 

is one of the two semi-resident populations in the United Kingdom. 

With the increasing anthropogenic disturbance, particularly significant for 

cetacean communities whose geographic ranges are limited or decreasing, the survival 

of a certain population depends a great deal on its habitat. As a result, understanding the 

home range of a population is crucial in order to attempt any protection and monitoring 

measures. Also known as pattern of residency, the home range is the area where the 

individual spends its time feeding, breeding and nursing the young. 

The purpose of this work is to estimate the home range of the bottlenose dolphin 

population by comparing different group sets in order to infer if there are any 

dissimilarities between the distributions of the selected groups. 

Using photo-identification data from 2007 to 2016 obtained from surveys, 

combined with other information regarding the individuals, Minimum Convex Polygons 

and Kernel Density Estimators were calculated and mapped for each group and then 

compared. Both mean home range (95% KDE) and core areas (50% KDE) were 

inferred. Mean water depths were also determined for each group. 

No significant differences were obtained for gender, markings in the dorsal fin 

and presence or absence of calf. There were, however differences in distribution for the 

summer and winter sightings.  

Additional important areas for this bottlenose dolphin populations were 

determined, as well as seasonal differences in distribution. Further surveys are required, 

mainly at the areas outside the Special Areas of Conservation in Cardigan Bay.

RESUMO 

O Golfinho-Roaz comum (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) pertence à sub-

ordem Odontoceti e é uma das espécies de cetáceos mais amplamente distribuídos. Pode 

ser encontrado em águas costeiras e oceânicas nas regiões tropicais e temperadas dos 

oceanos e mares. Dentro desta espécie, é possível encontrar populações residentes, cuja 

faixa residencial é limitada a um local específico, residentes sazonais, que só podem 

gastar parte do tempo na área e comunidades transitórias. A população de golfinhos 

roazes de Cardigan Bay (CB), utilizada para este estudo, é uma das duas populações 

semi-residentes no Reino Unido, sendo a outra em Moray Firth, na Escócia. Atualmente 

existem duas Áreas Especiais de Conservação (SACs) implementadas em Cardigan 

Bay: o Cardigan Bay SAC e o Pen Ll?n a'r Sarnau SAC. Apesar das constantes medidas 

de monitorização e proteção aplicadas, essa população tem sofrido um forte declínio 

desde 2007. 

Com o aumento do impacto antropogénico, particularmente significativo para as 

comunidades de cetáceos cujas amplitudes geográficas são limitadas ou decrescentes, a 

sobrevivência de uma determinada população depende muito do seu habitat. Como 

resultado, a compreensão dos padrões de residência de uma população é crucial para 

tentar qualquer proteção e medidas de monitorização. Também conhecido como padrão 

de residência, o home range é a área onde o indivíduo gasta o seu tempo a alimentar-se, 

a reproduzir-se e a criar as crias. 

O objetivo deste trabalho é identificar o home range da população de golfinhos 

roazes de CB. Ao comparar diferentes grupos, de acordo com certas características 

(género, data de avistamento, grau de marcações de barbatanas dorsais e presença de 

crias), é possível inferir as áreas que são mais importadas para cada grupo ou para toda 

a população, avaliando as desigualdades entre as distribuições dos grupos selecionados, 

a fim de verificar quais as medidas que podem ser aplicadas para diminuir o impacto 

exercido sobre estes animais. O uso de dados de foto identificação de 2007 a 2016 

obtidos a partir de pesquisas, combinadas com outras informações sobre os indivíduos, 

os Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP) e os Kernel Density Estimators (KDE) foram 

calculados e mapeados para cada grupo, sendo depois comparados. O MCP é usado para 

delinear a área total onde os animais são encontrados, enquanto o KDE determina quais 

as áreas que são mais utilizadas pela população. O intervalo médio dos padrões de 

residência, que representa as áreas sem os locais pouco comuns e  distantes 



vi 
 

relativamente à área de ocupação normal do indivíduo, corresponde a 95% de KDE, 

enquanto a core area, que representa as áreas mais ocupadas pela população, onde 

ocorreram 50% dos avistamentos, é representada por 50% do KDE. Ambos os home 

range médio (95% KDE) e core area (50% KDE) foram inferidos. As profundidades 

médias da água também foram determinadas para cada grupo. Quanto à comparação 

entre fêmeas e machos, a área total, a média dos padrões de residência obtidos e a core 

area foram ligeiramente maiores para os machos e as áreas de sobreposição também 

foram semelhantes. Como as diferenças não foram significativas, a distribuição espacial 

é semelhante para ambos os sexos. A maior limitação foi o maior número de fêmeas em 

relação ao número de machos estudados.  

O home range relativo aos encontros ocorridos durante os meses mais quentes (1 

de Abril até 31 de Outubro - Verão) está localizada principalmente em ambos os SAC e 

em menor grau no norte de Anglesey. Pelo contrário, o home range dos meses de 

Inverno (1 de Novembro até 31 de Março) foi mais dispersa, com menor presença na 

área de Cardigan Bay e maiores concentrações de golfinhos desta população em torno 

de Anglesey, perto de Liverpool Bay e da Isle of Man. Estes resultados implicam que a 

maioria dos animais passa o ano em locais completamente diferentes, durante o Inverno 

encontram-se no norte e passam o Verão no sul, em Cardigan Bay. 

Os golfinhos com barbatanas dorsais bem marcadas foram contrastados com 

golfinhos sem uma barbatana dorsal marcada. As áreas ocupadas pelos golfinhos sem 

marcas nas barbatanas dorsais sobrepuseram-se com as áreas ocupadas por indivíduos 

bem marcados. O facto dos animais bem marcados terem uma área estimada maior não 

significa que eles são mais ou que se expandam em áreas maiores. Os animais bem 

marcados são muito mais fáceis de identificar, enquanto que uma barbatana dorsal não 

marcada é muito mais difícil de usar como característica identificável. Deste modo, a 

área determinada pelos golfinhos sem marcas visíveis nas barbatanas dorsais é menor 

devido ao menor número de identificações ocorridas quando os encontros ocorreram. 

As fêmeas com crias foram avistadas em locais muito mais próximos da costa e 

mais concentrados nos dois SAC de Cardigan Bay, com algumas fêmeas sendo 

avistadas na costa norte de Anglesey, enquanto que durante os anos sem crias, as fêmeas 

não eram apenas vistas nesses locais mas também em Liverpool Bay e na Isle of Man. A 

sobreposição indicou que as fêmeas com crias não procuram áreas diferentes das 

ocupadas por outros golfinhos fêmeas sem crias. Em vez disso, as fêmeas sem crias 

tendem a dispersar-se mais para fora, ocupando toda a área da baía, enquanto as fêmeas 



vii 
 

com crias tendem a ficar mais perto da costa em locais mais protegidos. Esta 

comparação foi limitada pelo, por vezes, reduzido número de avistamentos de mães com 

crias, dado que, em alguns anos, os encontros não eram suficientes para determinar se a 

fêmea tinha crias ou não. 

Em relação às profundidades, a maioria dos grupos apresentou faixas de 

profundidade semelhantes com desvios padrão semelhantes. A única diferença notável 

foi a profundidade média dos avistamentos realizados no Inverno, porém a variação não 

foi significante, pois o valor do desvio padrão também foi maior para este grupo. Isso 

pode ser devido ao facto da maioria dos golfinhos estarem localizados fora da área de 

Cardigan Bay durante o estes meses. Como algumas áreas em torno de Anglesey são 

ligeiramente mais profundas do que a área de CB, a profundidade seria ligeiramente 

maior do que nos locais de verão. 

Neste estudo foram determinadas áreas importantes para esta população de 

golfinhos roazes, bem como diferenças sazonais na distribuição. Pesquisas adicionais 

serão necessárias, principalmente fora das Áreas Especiais de Conservação em Cardigan 

Bay.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

Despite being an emblematic and widespread group, small cetaceans are heavily 

impacted by anthropogenic activities (Cheney et al., 2013). The life history 

characteristics of these animals, since they are K-selected species, as well as the impacts 

caused by human activities on the marine habitats, particularly in near-shore 

environments, are reasons for their vulnerability (Ross et al., 2011). 

Human disturbance causes a particularly significant impact on cetacean 

communities whose geographic ranges are limited or decreasing. It is important to 

understand that the survival of a certain population depends a great deal on its habitat 

(Ross et al., 2011). Consequently, understanding the home range of a population is 

crucial in order to attempt any protection and monitoring measures (Ingram and Rogan, 

2002; Ross et al., 2011; Dwyer et al., 2016; Sprogis et al., 2016).  

 

 

 

As the population is presently declining (Feingold and Evans, 2014a; Lohrengel 

and Evans, 2015), more conservation measures are necessary in order to reverse this 

trend, as these animals are being increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities. 

This study aims to estimate the home range of the bottlenose dolphin population 

by comparing different group sets in order to infer if there are any dissimilarities 

between the distributions of the selected groups. By analysing the core areas it is 

possible to determine the most important areas to protect, assessing if there are different 

areas for opposite groups and how best to manage them, decreasing the pressure exerted 

on the population.

1.1.Cetaceans 

The order Cetacea, comprised of 87 species of whales, dolphins and porpoises 

(Hoyt, 2011) is divided into two sub-orders, the Mysticeti (baleen whales) and the 

Odontoceti (toothed whales), which include dolphins and porpoises (Evans and Raga, 

2012). The two suborders have radiated during the Oligocene from the archaeocetes, 

primitive toothed cetaceans that emerged from terrestrial mammals (Fordyce, 1980). 

Cetaceans vary in length, from 1.5m to 33m and inhabit marine ecosystems, 

although some species can be found in lakes and river systems. Having descended from 

mammals, cetaceans share certain traits with their terrestrial relatives, such as being air-

breathing homeotherms (Alves, 2013). 

These aquatic mammals are well adapted to living in aquatic ecosystems, with a 

streamline shaped body, flat paddle-shaped forelimbs and no external hindlimbs, having 

a horizontal tail - the fluke. In some species it is possible to find a dorsal fin. The nasal 

opening is located on top of the head in addition to reduced appendages (internal 

reproductive organs as well as internal ears) in order to decrease the water resistance 

(Fordyce, 1980; Evans and Raga, 2012; Jefferson et al., 1993). Furthermore, insulation 

is provided through a thick layer of sub-dermal fat named blubber, allowing these 

animals to occupy a wide variety of temperatures, from 2ºC to over 30ºC (Evans and 

Raga, 2012; Alves, 2013). 

Despite all this similarities, there are quite a few differences between the two sub-

orders. The mysticetes are often larger than the toothed whales and possess baleen 

plates, a feeding apparatus that allows the animal to filter prey organisms present in the 

water column. On the other hand, odontocetes feed on individual large food items, such 

as fish, cephalopods and crustaceans, using their teeth. Exceptions can be found, as 

these do not erupt through the gums of the females of the family Ziphiidae (Fordyce, 

1980; Evans and Raga, 2012). 

The other main distinction regards the nasal cavity, known as blowhole. 

Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas odontocetes only possess one (Jefferson et al., 

1993; Evans and Raga, 2012).  

Diverse studies have been conducted in order to gather knowledge on these 

animals, however, in opposition to terrestrial animals, aquatic mammals are not 

frequently visible, since they spend most of their time underwater (Gowans et al.,2007). 

Their aquatic lifestyle presents a challenge for scientific studies, as it is often 

complicated to observe or detect the animals. Moreover, these species are highly mobile 



3 
 

and may occupy a wide geographical area, including sometimes great depths. Most 

research studies are concentrated in small areas, which can hinder the possibility to 

gather information if the animals occur in a greater range or even in neighbouring 

countries (Evans and Hammond, 2004; Alves, 2013; Nuuttila et al., 2013). 

In addition, the large body size, fragility, endangered status and the high levels of 

public attention towards these aquatic mammals can lead to a more demanding way to 

acquire knowledge from cetaceans (Alves, 2013). 

 

 

1.2. The bottlenose dolphin  

The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) belongs to 

the sub-order Odontoceti and is one of the most widely distributed species of cetaceans 

(Fig. 1). It can be found in both coastal and oceanic waters in the tropical and temperate 

regions of oceans and seas. Some populations reside in rivers and estuaries (Gregory 

and Rowden, 2001; Santos et al., 2007).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is probably the most recognised species of cetaceans, featuring in several 

movies and due to its captivity in zoos and dolphinariums. Despite this, there has been a 

debate in the scientific community regarding the systematics of this genus. Presently, 

the genus Tursiops consists of three distinct species: Tursiops truncatus, T. aduncus and 

T. australis (Connor et al., 2000; Charlton-Robb et al., 2011).

bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in grey.

Members of this species display great variation in size and coloration. Adults can 

measure between 1.9 to 4.1meters and weigh between 150 to 650kg, with the males 

typically slightly larger than the females. Coloration can range between dark gray to 

light grey with a white belly (Fig.2). Individuals are usually found in groups (Shirihai, 

2006). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In this species, two disparate strategies have been considered: the coastal resident 

populations and the wide ranging oceanic populations. In resident populations, since the 

amount of prey and resources available is relatively small, large groups would be 

disadvantageous. For that reason, group size in these communities is reduced, leading to 

lower competition for food. Since these populations inhabit locations with lower risk of 

predation, safety in numbers is not a necessity. On the other hand, oceanic groups have 

a tendency to expand over large areas, as prey availability is often irregular and in low 

concentration. Frequently, these communities must rely on a big group, as refuge from 

predators is scarce and prey schools tend to concentrate in small regions, with large 

areas without any food available. In both these cases, a large community provides 

protection and increases foraging and ability to catch prey (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; 

Gowans et al., 2007).  

It is, however, quite complicated to conclude with certainty the strategies and 

patterns of movement of the oceanic groups, as the act of studying them is complex, 

particularly considering its large area of distribution. Furthermore, offshore bottlenose 

communities have a tendency to present a dissimilar social structure, exhibiting

relatively lower low-term associations and greater ranges (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; 

Gowans et al., 2007). 

Gowans et al (2007) have also referred that, based on genetic studies, inshore and 

offshore ecotypes display marked genetic differences. For that reason, both are isolated 

from each other on a reproductive level.  

 

 

1.3. Group living in bottlenose dolphins 

When encountering members of the species Tursiops truncatus, it is possible to 

observe several individuals. Like most delphinids, these animals form groups or pods. A 

group is a set of individuals that display stronger associations amongst each other than 

with the other members of the population over large periods of time (Connor et al., 

1998). 

There are several advantages in forming groups such as the decrease in mortality 

due to predation, increase in detection and acquisition of prey and other resources and a 

bigger amount of individuals for reproduction. Moreover, the probability of acquiring 

knowledge through learning and social interactions increases when an individual is 

inserted in a group (Gowans et al., 2007).  

However, group living may increase competition for food and other resources as 

well as probability of spreading certain illnesses or parasites (Gowans et al., 2007). 

Despite the existence of a few disadvantages, grouping is quite common in 

cetaceans. In fact, Connor et al (2000) refers that all populations of bottlenose dolphins 

appear to form what was called fission-fusion groups. In this grouping strategy, 

associations formed between different animals often change in composition for small 

periods of time.  

Depending on the activity in progress at the time, different groups may be 

defined, nevertheless each individual can be considered to be in more than one 

simultaneously (Gowans et al., 2007). One example could be of a nursery group, where 

several females have grouped to take care of calves, that join a feeding group. 

The decrease or absence of competition is quite beneficial for the success of the 

group or groups and cooperation can exist even when the animals are not related to each 

other (Gowans et al., 2007).

1.4. Photo-identification 

Photo identification is a method based on the analysis of photographs whose goal 

is to identify and recognise different individuals (Fig.3). 

 

 

 

 

 

According to Würsig and Jefferson (1990) studies comparing natural marks in 

cetaceans have started in the early 1970's.  

One main advantage to using this particular method is that it does not harm the 

animals sampled. It also provides an array of information with a relatively low cost 

(Evans and Hammond, 2004). 

Photo-identification can be useful in assessing movement and population 

parameters, namely life history information, such as age of sexual maturity, 

reproductive and total life span, calving intervals, length of nursing, and, in some cases, 

mortality and disease rates. Group composition and behaviour of the population is 

possible to be inferred when all the individuals are accounted for. Area distribution as 

well as short term movement patterns and migrations are also possible to be determined,

when the photo-identification occurs in different locations (Würsig and Jefferson, 1990; 

Evans and Hammond, 2004; Connor and Krutzen, 2015).  

Reliable data must be attained for these studies, in order to avoid getting biased 

information. The natural marks used for the recognition of the animal must be 

discernible over time as well as be unique to that specific individual. In most cases this 

condition is easily met, since most marks will seldom change beyond recognition even 

when other marks appear in the dorsal fin/fluke. In addition, most marks will be present 

throughout the individual's lifetime (Würsig and Jefferson, 1990; Evans and Hammond, 

2004). 

Another consideration when photographing the individuals is that most dolphins 

or whales acquire marks or nicks as they get older, hence the probability to recognise a 

calf or a juvenile is much lower. Fortunately, marks tend to appear as the individual gets 

older, improving the possibilities of identification (Würsig and Jefferson, 1990). 

Despite most photo-identification work only accounting for the marks, nicks and 

amputations present in flukes or dorsal fins as well as its shape, some studies (Katona 

and Whitehead, 1981; Würsig and Jefferson, 1990; Hartman et al., 2014) have pointed 

out other ways to positively identify cetaceans, such as using pectoral fins in order to 

identify Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), as well as pigment patterns in 

different species of whales. In addition, shading of the fin and upper body, wounds and 

foreign objects present in the animal can be useful when recognising a specific 

individual. One trait more commonly found in the Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) is 

the scarification pattern present on the animal's dorsal fins and bodies.  

Despite all the different characteristics, all these must be identifiable and 

including poor quality photographs may lead to animals not being recognized or 

correctly named. Even when the photographs have a good quality, not all animals in the 

population may bear distinguishable markings along with the fact that in some species 

most individuals do not hold natural lasting marks or scars. (Evans and Hammond, 

2004). 

Moreover, other approaches have been used in order to collect the same type of 

information as the one gathered through photo-identification. Some whale species have 

been identified from airplanes, however delphinids are not possible to identify using this 

method. Another method used is underwater acoustics, which does not require 

visualisation of the animals. However, the animals must be vocalising for this method to 

be successfully employed and some species only do so throughout specific times of the 



8 
 

year. Underwater photography is also a potentially important method, as the animals are 

more frequently under water (Würsig and Jefferson, 1990; Evans and Hammond, 2004). 

Despite having some disadvantages, photo-identification can be applied to several 

studies, such as habitat preference (MacLeod et al., 2007). By understanding the 

species' habitat preference, it may be possible to predict its response to changes of the 

environment, mitigating the impact of human interactions with cetaceans. Another use 

of employing photo-identification is to ascertain home range as well as determining 

resident and non-resident cetacean populations (Hartman et al., 2014; Hartman et al., 

2015). Additionally, mark-recapture methods applied to photo-identification are 

frequently used in monitoring programs, often improving conservation efforts (Evans 

and Hammond, 2004).  

 

 

1.5. Home range 

Burt (1943) has defined home range, also known as pattern of residency, as the 

area where the individual spends its time feeding, breeding and nursing the young 

(Defran et al., 1999; Ingram and Rogan, 2002).  

In the past this concept has been used in studies of terrestrial mammals (Ingram 

and Rogan, 2002), however residence patterns have increasingly been used to determine 

important habitats for populations of aquatic mammals (Dinis et al., 2016). 

Nevertheless, not all species and even populations of the same species will occupy 

the same exact locations: some populations can use the same home range for decades 

and other populations may display temporary or seasonal migrations away from the 

area. Sometimes it is even possible to find different home ranges for different 

individuals in the same geographical area (Defran et al., 1999).  

In bottlenose dolphins, it is possible to find strict resident populations, whose 

home range is limited to a specific location, seasonal residents, which may only spend a 

portion of time in the area and transient communities (Papale et al., 2016).  

Using location data, the home range can be estimated through two simple widely 

applied methods: MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon) and KDE (Kernel Density). MCP 

is used to outline the total area where the animals are found. However, this approach 

tends to overestimate the home range, as it builds a convex polygon of the area used, 

assuming that the animals use this area equally. Odd locations, far away from the 

normal area used will induce a biased home range, as MCP does not take into account 



9 
 

that most animals tend to spend more time in some areas than other (Anderson, 1982; 

MacLeod, 2013; Sprogis et al., 2016).  

In order to determine which areas are more frequently used by the population a 

different method must be applied. The KDE assumes the areas with a greater number of 

sightings are more important for the individuals than the areas with low density of 

records. In this approach, 50% and 95% KDE polygons are created. Mean home range, 

that represents the areas without the odd locations far away from the individual's normal 

range, corresponds to 95% KDE whereas the core area, which stands for the most 

occupied areas by the population, where 50% of the total number of sightings occurred, 

is represented by 50% KDE (Anderson, 1982; Hauser et al., 2007; MacLeod, 2013). 

The original KDE was used for populations within study areas that did not contain 

any barriers to movement. For offshore cetacean species, whose habitat allows them to 

move freely, this method can be used. However, for coastal cetacean population, such as 

the Cardigan Bay bottlenose dolphins, this implies an overestimation of the home range, 

as the coastline acts as a barrier to the movement. In order to avoid a biased home range 

estimation the method used must take into account the presence of barriers in the study 

area (MacLeod, 2013; Sprogis et al., 2016). 

Other than the presence of barriers to the movements of the animals, home range 

may be affected by physical habitat features, such as depth, variability in climate, 

temperature, salinity, tidal cycles and other ocean processes (Ingram and Rogan, 2002; 

Hauser et al., 2007). 

Individuals use their home range to gather food and other resources, to avoid 

predators and attain conditions for their survival. Therefore, home range is not a fixed 

location in time. Ecological conditions may alter, causing modifications on the 

distribution patterns with the goal to increase the group's chances of survival and 

reproductive success (Lusseau, 2005; Hauser et al., 2007; Powell and Mitchell, 2012).  

These changes in distribution may also include areas known by the animal, yet 

were not visited before (Powell and Mitchell, 2012). By studying home range, 

particularly in cetaceans, the researcher must take into account not only the areas where 

the animals can be found, but also the social organisation and behaviour of the 

populations (Hauser et al., 2007).  

In an innovative study, Powell and Mitchell (2012) have attempted to determine 

how an individual would perceive its home range and have presumed that a residence 

pattern originates from a combination of resource availability (the environment) and the 



10 
 

animal's understanding of that environment, its cognitive map. By determining how the 

individual's decision-making process works in regards to changes in the environmental 

conditions, home range would be more accurately estimated. 

It is, however, still not possible to determine a home range based on this method. 

Consequently, quantitative statistical approaches are presently used. One other 

disadvantage is the dynamism of residency patterns, often altering in a timescale that 

would not allow an effective data collection for its estimation (Powell and Mitchell, 

2012). 

There are several methods that can be used to obtain information to estimate a 

population's home range. Previously, visual data was the main method used (Sveegard 

et al., 2011). Nevertheless, other techniques started being employed in order to attain 

the same information. These include use of telemetry (Powell and Mitchell, 2012) and 

multiple acoustic methods (Sveegard et al., 2011; Nuuttila et al., 2013). 

Although a decrease in resource availability can play an important role in shifting 

a population's home range (Defran et al., 1999; Gowans et al., 2007; Sveegard et al., 

2011), anthropogenic disturbance caused by fishery activities as well as overall boat 

traffic and noise are cause for concern regarding the dolphin's welfare. For dolphins, 

boat presence could lead to physical injuries from collisions, hearing problems from the 

excessive noise, more time spent foraging due to avoidance of areas with large amounts 

of boats (Lusseau, 2005; Pierpoint et al., 2009; Papale et al., 2016). 

Information regarding residency patterns can be applied in conservation and 

management efforts of resident populations. By determining the most frequently used 

areas for a certain population or group, considered to be the locations where food and 

other resources are more abundant, it would be possible to more effectively protect it, 

creating Marine Protected Areas or decreasing anthropogenic impact close to that area 

(Sveegard et al., 2011; Hartman et al., 2015).  One example was the creation of the 

Gully Marine Protected Area, in Nova Scotia due to the presence of a resident 

population of the northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) (Hartman et al., 

2015). 

 

 

 

 

 



11 
 

1.6. The study population 

The Cardigan Bay bottlenose dolphin population is one of the two semi-resident 

populations in the United Kingdom, the other being the Moray Firth, in Scotland 

(Feingold and Evans, 2014a).  

Estimates of the size of the population vary between 121 and 230 individuals, 

with a greater presence during the summer season. On the other hand, some individuals 

keep being sighted in the bay during the winter months (Feingold and Evans, 2014a). 

Previous studies have determined that several individuals have been moving 

towards the north, mostly at the north coast of Anglesey, with sightings recorded as far 

as Liverpool Bay and the Isle of Man during the summer months, which leads to the 

conclusion that these dolphins no longer inhabit the Cardigan Bay area during the 

summer (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; Pierpoint et al., 2009; Feingold and Evans, 

2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). 

Until recently the dolphin population was growing in numbers. However, with the 

increase in boat disturbance, the decrease in prey and overall anthropogenic impact the 

population has suffered a decline (Feingold and Evans, 2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 

2015). 

 

 

1.7. Objectives 

The present study aims to assess the home range of the bottlenose dolphin 

population of Cardigan Bay using long-term photo-identification data in order to 

improve the knowledge of this population and contribute for its conservation.  

The objectives of this study are as follows: 

 - Compare the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) as well as 50% and 95% 

Kernel Density Estimators (KDE) of males vs females. 

 - Compare the MCP as well as 50% and 95% KDE of the individuals sighted in 

the summer vs individuals sighted in the winter. 

 - Compare the MCP as well as 50% and 95% KDE of the dolphins without marks 

in the dorsal fin vs heavily marked dolphins. 

 - Compare the MCP as well as 50% and 95% KDE of females with calves vs 

females without calves. 

 - Determine the mean depths for each group.  



12 
 

 

These objectives are designed to answer the following questions: 

(1) Do females and males occupy the same areas and where do they stay? 

(2) Does the population remain at the same location during the summer and the 

winter? If not, where do they go? 

(3) Is there a difference in identification between dolphins with a well-marked 

dorsal fin and dolphins without marks in their dorsal fins? 

(4) Do bottlenose dolphin mothers stay in different locations with their calves than 

when they don't have a calf? Is there a place in Cardigan Bay where mothers do not go 

with their calves or a place only mothers and calves go to? 

(5) Is there a different depth range for any of the groups previously mentioned?

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

2.1. Study Area 

Located in West Wales, Cardigan Bay is the largest bay of the British Isles with 

an estimated area of 5000 km
2 

measuring over 100km between its northern (the Ll?n 

Peninsula) and southern boundaries (St David’s Head). It is surrounded by the coastline 

of Wales on three sides and opens to the Irish Sea on its western border (Fig.4). Its 

greatest depth reaches about 50 m, however the average depth is approximately 40 

meters. Its depth increases from east to west with very gentle slopes (Gregory and 

Rowden, 2001; Anon, 2007; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cardigan Bay is relatively sheltered, having calm waters, particularly at small 

embayments within the bay. Salinity is greater in the south and lower near the coast due 

to freshwater input from rivers and rainfall (Anon, 2007). 

The seabed of the bay is diverse in its nature, being comprised of sand and broken 

shells, gravel, shingle and mud (Gregory and Rowden, 2001; Anon, 2007). 

Boat traffic is frequent, mainly in the summer months, with tourist activities such 

as water sports and recreational boat trips, with wildlife boat trips actively chasing the 

semi-resident population of bottlenose dolphins present in the bay (Gregory and 

Rowden, 2001).

Under the European Community's Habitats Directive, two Special Areas of 

Conservation (SACs) were implemented in Cardigan Bay: the Cardigan Bay SAC in the 

south and the Pen Ll?n a’r Sarnau SAC in the north (Fig.5). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Proposed in 1996, both officially started in 2004, with the main purpose of 

protecting the marine wildlife present in both areas (Anon, 2007; Evans and Pesante, 

2008; Pierpoint et al., 2009) 

The Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation is located from the Teifi Estuary 

to Aberaeron. It has approximately 960km
2 

and its primary objective is to protect the 

semi-resident bottlenose dolphin population as well as other species and habitat 

features, such as the Atlantic Grey Seal (Halichoerus grypus), the River Lamprey 

(Lamptera fluviatilis), the Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), reefs, submerged sea 

banks and submerged or partially submerged sea caves (Anon, 2007; Evans and 

Pesante, 2008; Pierpoint et al., 2009; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  

The Pen Ll?n a’r Sarnau Special Area of Conservation, between the Dovey 

Estuary and around the Lleyn Peninsula, has an estimated area of 1460km
2
. Originally 

designed to protect mostly habitat features, such as estuaries, reefs, shallow bays and 

inlets, mudflats and subtidal sand banks, as well as the European Otter (Lutra lutra) it

later encompassed the Bottlenose Dolphin (Pen Ll?n cSAC Plan, 2001; Evans and 

Pesante, 2008; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  

 

2.2. Data collection, treatment and analysis 

The dataset used in this study was collected by the Sea Watch Foundation (SWF) 

between 2007 and 2016. Land-based and boat-based surveys were conducted 

throughout the year in Cardigan Bay, around the coast of Anglesey, in Liverpool Bay 

and at the Isle of Man.  

Surveys occurred mainly between April and October, however there have been 

sightings in other months, particularly in the north of Anglesey.  

While collecting data, environmental conditions need to be favourable, with sea 

state 3 or less, the visibility must be over 1.5km and absence of precipitation (Lohrengel 

and Evans, 2015).  

Boat-based data was collected from dedicated line transect surveys aboard 

motorised vessels with members of the SWF as well as trained volunteers. The line 

transects had been previously defined (Figures 6 and 7) and are chosen at random at the 

beginning of each survey.

As seen in Lohrengel and Evans (2015), there are four observers (two primary and 

two independent) actively searching for the animals as well as a researcher recording 

effort data at all times throughout the survey. Environmental data such as visibility, 

precipitation, glare, sea state and swell are recorded on the effort forms every 15 

minutes. Other information such as boat speed and course, location coordinates and 

presence or absence of other vessels in the area is also registered (Fig. 3.1 - Appendix 

III). When bottlenose dolphins are present, effort must be done every three minutes. 

Data recorded includes location (geographical coordinates), behaviour, group size and 

composition, video and underwater video recordings. Occasionally, underwater acoustic 

data and drone footage can also be attained. Information such as the distance from the 

boat, first cue the observer spotted (dorsal fin, fluke, back, head, blow,...), reaction to 

the boat and the angle where the animal was first spotted is also part of the data 

collected. 

Photo-identification is also carried out, when possible, both in the line transect 

and the ad libitum surveys. The latter are conducted when weather conditions are not 

ideal or aboard wildlife watching vessels. Photographs were taken using a Canon EOS 

40D or a Canon EOS 7D camera body with 18-200mm, 18-300mm or 75-300mm

telephoto zoom lens (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). The trips aboard the whale watching 

vessels are only carried out at the near-shore area of the Cardigan Bay SAC. 

On land-based surveys it is necessary to document the number of animals (adults 

and calves) that can be seen along with the location they were first spotted. 

Additionally, all boat encounters must be registered as well as the distance of the 

animals to the boats. The number of vessels present in the water is another feature that 

must be written down. 

All research was carried out under licence from Natural Resources Wales and 

following all the rules regarding interactions with cetaceans.  

 

 

After the encounters, all data is treated. Each dorsal fin photograph must have 

enough quality so that it can be used to confidently identify the individual. If this is not 

possible, the photo must be deleted. After the photographs are determined to have 

sufficient quality, each one is given a code. An example of the code is 

160124_001_dunbar_RCO_001, where 160124 is the date (year 2016, on January 24
th

), 

001 represents the encounter number, dunbar is the name of the boat (when the survey 

is land-based, this should be replaced with "land"), RCO corresponds the initials of the 

photographer (Rita COrreia) and the last three numbers stand for the consecutive order 

of the photograph. 

After the photographs are batch renamed, they must be cropped in order to obtain 

a photograph that shows the fin and any scars present on the body that could be used to 

more easily identify the individual. All pictures of the same individual must be given 

the same code at the beginning of the name. 

The dorsal fin is then compared with the photographs catalogued. There are three 

different catalogues: two containing all the unmarked dorsal fins, divided into the left 

and right catalogues, corresponding to the side represented in the photograph. The third 

catalogue is divided into two sub-catalogues, the well-marked and the slightly marked. 

 After a match is found or the animal is not on the catalogue, it must be validated. 

The validation process will be completed by someone else, in order to have certainty 

that the identification is correct. Afterwards, the sighting information is stored to be 

used for future studies. 

 

 



18 
 

In this study the dataset had the following information: name, sex, date of sighting 

and geographic coordinates. All sightings from the marked catalogue were used, 

however, in order to prevent using the same animal more than once, only data from the 

left catalogue was analysed.  

All dolphins not sighted a minimum of 4 years between 2007 and 2016 were 

excluded from the dataset. The individuals had to have seen sighted in at least four 

different years in order to insure that these were not transients or occasional visitors.  

All the dolphins present in the dataset were divided into several different 

datasheets, according to the characteristics analysed. A minimum of 30 sightings were 

used for determining home ranges, as done in other studies (Hartman et al., 2014; 

Hartman et al., 2015), in order to obtain an accurate analysis.  

In order to compare females and males, the dataset was divided into only females 

and only males. Possible females and possible males were excluded from this study, as 

sexing is often difficult and no confirmation of these animals' gender could lead to a 

biased home range estimation. 

When comparing summer and winter, all the sightings were ordered by their date 

of occurrence. Sightings between April 1
st
 and October 31

st
 were classified as summer 

sightings. Between November 1
st
 and March 31

st 
occurred the winter sightings. All 

dolphins that did not have both winter and summer sightings were excluded. 

In the well-marked against not-marked study, only the well-marked and the non-

marked left catalogued individuals in the dataset were included. 

As for the females with calves and females without calves, every female that had 

been seen next to calf at least 3 times in the same year was considered a mother in that 

year. Only females who had previously been mothers were used in the comparison. 

Furthermore, information regarding females and calves from the year 2016 was not 

available for this study, as a result the sightings used occurred between 2007 and 2015.  

All data was analysed using the ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 software. The geographic 

coordinate system used was WGS 1984 whereas the projected coordinate system was a 

custom Transverse Mercator (Latitude of Origin: 51; Central Meridian: -1). 

In order to calculate the total area used by each group of individuals an MCP 

(Minimum Convex Polygon) was estimated (Hartman et al., 2015). Considering the fact 

that cetaceans are exclusively aquatic mammals, all areas of the MCP that fall on land 

were removed. For each group to be compared a map was created and the total area was 

calculated. 



19 
 

The residency patterns are calculated using kernel density estimators (KDE) in 

order to determine the distributions and space use of each group (Hauser et al., 2007; 

Dwyer et al., 2016). Once again, all areas that fall on land must be excluded, making 

this a kernel analysis with barriers. To remove the land from the study a polygon data 

layer, whose coordinate values are as follows: Top: 300000; Right: 90000; Bottom: -

60000; Left: -170000. 

Subsequent to attaining the map with the KDE values with barriers, two PVCs 

(Percentage Volume Contours) were created for each group of dolphins, the 95%PVC 

that represents the mean home range and the 50%PVC, which corresponds to the core 

area (Hauser et al., 2007). Using the 50% and 95% polygons previously created, the 

whole area was then calculated for each different group.  

The areas for each set of individuals to be compared were combined into a single 

polygon in order to determine the overlap between each set of dolphins. Percentage of 

overlap was also determine for both methods. 

After all the comparisons, a water depth raster was added in order to determine the 

mean depth for each group, using the 95% PVCs previously attained, with the 

determination of the mean water depth and standard variation of each group. 

The standard error for each group was calculated as follows: 

 

               
  

  
 

 

where    corresponds to the standard deviation obtained and n is the total number 

of sightings for the group. 

Both MCP and KDE were determined following MacLeod (2013).

3. RESULTS 

 

The main dataset contained a total of 4232 sightings from 189 dolphins. As 

previously stated, the dataset was divided into several groups. The number of sightings 

and dolphins analysed in each groups is depicted in Table 1.

3.1. Females vs Males 

Though the number of females was greater than the number of males in the 

dataset, the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) was higher for the males (9715,30 km
2
) 

than the females (8812,05 km
2
). However, the area of overlap represents a big portion 

of both MCP areas (7512,54 km
2
), with a similar percentage of overlap for both groups 

(77.3% for males and 85.3% for females). Both maps with the females and males' MCPs 

are represented by figures 8 and 9. 

The Kernel Density Estimate areas calculated for both females and males can be 

found on Table 2, while the maps are located in figures 1.1 and 1.2 (Appendix I), 

respectively.

3.2. Summer vs Winter 

When comparing sightings that occurred in the cold and hot months, the winter 

MCP was higher (8139,72 km

2
). The overlap 

consisted of 5052,90 km

(figures 10 and 11). The percentage of overlap was 79.3% for 

the summer and 62.1% for the winter.

). The overlap 

consisted of 5454,76 km

4. DISCUSSION 

 

The present study has determined the home range of the semi-resident population 

of bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay. As previously stated, some of these animals 

spend the entirety of their time in the Cardigan Bay (CB) area. However, many 

individuals have been seen outside the bay at some point around the years (Feingold and 

Evans, 2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). Taking this into account, I have decided to 

include the sightings from the north coast of Anglesey, Liverpool Bay and the Isle of 

Man, in order to determine the real extent of these dolphin's home range, including 

locations outside the study area. These animals inhabit a specially changeable habitat 

due to the increasing anthropogenic disturbance, hence all data available must be used 

in the efforts to improve the conservation measures for this population. 

 

 

4.1. Females vs Males 

Regarding the Minimum Convex Polygon comparison between females and males 

of the population, the greater area of MCP for the males was mostly caused by a few 

sightings of male dolphins between north Anglesey and the Liverpool Bay, as visible in 

figure 9. Further information is required in order to determine if only males are present 

in the area or if these sightings correspond to an uncommon occurrence.  

 

In respect to the core area and home range estimation, despite males having larger 

areas, these differences were not high enough to be significant, as the percentage of 

overlap is similar for both groups. A percentage of overlap of 69.5% means that the area 

of overlap constitutes 69.5% of the male's total home range while the females' area of 

overlap corresponded to 73% of their total mean home range area. 

Thus, despite the slight difference in home range areas, males and females do not 

seem to use different areas, both inside and outside the bay. These results are in 

accordance with a previous masters thesis study on the relationship between 

reproductive success and home range (Baylis, 2013). 

 

The number of females and males was not proportionate in this study, as fewer 

males were used (16 males and 55 females). As previously stated, possible males and 

females were excluded from this comparison. This marked difference in number of 



30 
 

individuals used was a result, as stated in Feingold and Evans (2014a) of the difficulty 

in gender determination of male dolphins. The genital area is not often seen and females 

are easier to identify when they are seen with their calves.  

In order to attain better data, gender determination must be improved. As 

suggested by Feingold and Evans (2014a), genetic sampling would contribute to the 

increase in information regarding the population studied.  

 

 

4.2. Summer vs Winter 

The greater MCP area for the winter sightings suggest that the population is much 

more dispersed between November 1
st
 and March 31

st
. As seen in figure 10, the summer 

sightings were mostly concentrated in Cardigan Bay, with a few dolphins spotted 

around Anglesey and two sightings in the Liverpool Bay area. The absence of sightings 

at the Isle of Man also contributes to the lower MCP area determined.  

Moreover, the overlap between the winter and summer MCPs was much greater 

for the summer locations than the winter (79.3% for summer and 62.1% for winter), 

meaning the area of overlap makes up 79% of the summer area and only 62% of the 

winter area.  

 

Concerning the home range estimations, as seen in figure 1.3 (Appendix I), the 

summer mean home range is located mostly in both SACs and in north Anglesey.  The 

core area is located in the coastal area of Cardigan Bay SAC. On the contrary, the 

winter home range is more disperse, with a lower presence in the Cardigan bay area and 

greater dolphin concentrations around Anglesey, near Liverpool Bay and at the Isle of 

Man. The winter core areas were mostly at the northern coast of Anglesey and, on a 

lower level, at the Cardigan Bay SAC. The presence of bottlenose dolphins in these 

areas is in line with previous works. Feingold and Evans (2014a) and Lohrengel and 

Evans (2015) have mentioned the presence of individuals from the CB area at the 

previously mentioned areas during the winter time, as shown in this study, as well as 

during the summer. The data used for this study, however did not contain summer 

sightings at such locations. This may be due to the fact that only dolphins sighted both 

during the winter and the summer were selected or due to the low coverage of the 

northern areas.  



31 
 

The mean home range is greater for the summer sightings, as there are more 

individuals that occupy the whole bay, in opposition to the winter home ranges, where 

the animals are mostly concentrated around the northern coast of Anglesey and a few 

animals are scattered between the two Special Areas of Conservation and the Isle of 

Man. The greater concentration of dolphins around Anglesey, however, leads to a 

slightly greater core area, as the summer core area is only found at the coastal area of 

the Cardigan Bay SAC. The overlap in core areas was extremely low but similar for 

both groups, meaning the majority of the animals spend the year in completely different 

locations: winter in the north and summer in the south.  

 

Despite demonstrating a clear difference between summer and winter sightings, 

additional data is necessary, especially in the winter time and at the northern areas 

outside Cardigan Bay, as surveys were mostly conducted in the summer and at the CB 

SAC area.  

 

 

4.3. Well marked vs Non-marked 

As the percentage overlap for the non-marked MCP corresponds to the entirety of 

the area we can determine that there is no difference in distribution of non-marked and 

well marked animals, as both well-marked and non-marked animals were sighted in the 

exact same places where the areas overlap. However, as the overlap only corresponds to 

less than half of the well marked MCP area (46,8%),  these dolphins can be found 

across a much greater area.  

 

The home range and core area are in line with the MCPs obtained, with slight 

insignificant variations, with similar percentage overlaps and similar areas for both, 

only smaller for the non-marked animals.  

The fact that well-marked animals have a greater estimated area does not mean 

they are greater in numbers or expand in greater areas. Well-marked dolphins are much 

easier to identify and most photographs taken will lead to a correct identification, even 

if the photograph does not have excellent quality, whereas a non-marked dorsal fin is 

much harder to use as an identifiable feature. Using non-marked unidentifiable dorsal 

fins is even discouraged for population size estimations (Würsig and Jefferson, 1990).  



32 
 

All non-marked dolphins used in this study were positively identified, through 

other distinct features, such as dorsal fin shape, distinctive markings in their body or 

even particular pigmentations patterns unique to the individuals. 

The lower number of non-marked animals with lower home ranges derives from 

the low level of certainty from the identification of these dolphins. At the SWF, a 

greater number of marked individuals were positively identified than un-marked 

individuals during a portion of the years used at this study (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). 

 

Though there has been an improvement in technology in relation to photographic 

equipment, in order to obtain better identification features for non-marked dolphins, 

greater improvements must be attained in order to get better quality photographs. Other 

equipment, as drone footage and better quality underwater video cameras, would be 

useful for spotting more defining features in the body of unmarked individuals. 

  

 

4.4. Females with calves vs Females without calves 

As seen previously, the MCP percentage overlap for females with calves was 

approximately 99.5% whereas the females without calves overlap was 56.8%. As 

represented in figures 14 and 15, the females with calves were sighted in locations much 

closer to shore and more concentrated at the two Cardigan Bay SACs, with a few 

females being spotted at the northern coast of Anglesey, whereas during the years 

without a calf, females were also seen at Liverpool Bay and the Isle of Man. 

 

When observing the home range and core area estimations, the females with 

calves had an almost total overlap while the overlap for females without calves was 

around 50% for both 95% and 50% KDE, which indicates that the females with calves 

do not seek different areas than the ones occupied by other females dolphins without 

calves. Instead, females without calves tend to spread further away offshore, occupying 

the whole bay area, while females with calves tend to stay closer to shore at more 

sheltered locations. These locations may be more attractive to mothers, providing the 

opportunity to forage more quickly, leaving the calves alone for less time as well as 

allowing the calves to start learning how to catch prey (Feingold and Evans, 2014a). 



33 
 

The northern areas (Liverpool Bay and Isle of Man) were not represented, as the 

number of encounters was not sufficient for establishing this area as important for these 

animals. 

The females with calves had a much smaller home range and core areas than the 

females without calves, which corresponds to the results obtained by Baylis (2013) that 

has stated that females with greater reproductive success tend to have smaller home 

ranges and core areas.  

The Cardigan Bay area is an important nursery area for the bottlenose dolphins 

(Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). The presence of mothers and calves at the Pen Ll?n a’r 

Sarnau SAC suggests this area is also used as a nursery in opposition to being 

exclusively used for socialization and mating, which further strengthens the hypothesis 

mentioned at Feingold and Evans (2014a).  

 

Further studies must be conducted at the northern coast of Anglesey, as several 

females with calves encounters have occurred at this location. Possible conservation 

measures may be applied in order to protect the areas if they are in fact important for 

this species. Also, surveys must be also done at the northern locations (Liverpool Bay 

and Isle of Man), in order to determine of this is in fact an area with a regular presence 

of individuals from this population. 

 

 

4.5. Water depth 

Most groups had similar depth ranges with similar standard deviations. The only 

noticeable difference was the winter depth, of -26.6m. The variation was not significant, 

however, as the standard deviation value was also greater for this group (Table 6). 

The greater depth is in line with the fact that most dolphins are located outside the 

Cardigan Bay Area during the winter time. As some areas surrounding Anglesey are 

slightly deeper than the CB area, the depth would be slightly higher than at the summer 

home range locations.  

 

Studies conducted on other resident populations show a variable array of depths 

for this species. The resident population of bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay 

(Florida) prefer sites with a depth lower than 3 meters whereas the populations of the 



34 
 

Moray Firth (Scotland) and Shannon estuary (Ireland) prefer deep waters with steep 

slopes (Wilson et al., 1997; Ingram and Rogan, 2002). 

Ingram and Rogan (2002) have determined that the depth preferred by the 

Shannon Estuary resident bottlenose dolphin population was of 30m to 50m, slightly 

greater than the depths determined in this study. However, this preference was 

correlated to the greater prey availability. Further studies must be conducted in order to 

determine if prey availability in the Cardigan Bay area corresponds to the depths 

attained in this study or if there are other factors that contribute for the lower depth 

preference.    

 

 

4.6. Data gathering 

The processing of acquiring data is extremely complex in cetacean research as, 

unlike terrestrial animals, cetaceans are hidden beneath the surface most of the time, 

only becoming visible for a few moments each time. Consequently, some errors and 

restrictions are bound to occur.  

Firstly, boat traffic has been known to have an impact on behaviour and 

distribution of bottlenose dolphins, especially with a great number of vessels (Feingold 

and Evans, 2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015). When aboard the whale watching 

vessels, this influence is greater, namely at the New Quay bay, where boat density is 

high mainly in the summer months. This disturbance, though in a smaller scale, also 

extends to the presence of the research vessels. It is, however, not possible to study 

these animals without some degree of disturbance. Nevertheless, researchers always 

seek to keep the impact to a minimum.  

Some errors in the dataset were deleted, such as a dolphin encounter near 

Birmingham (central England). The volunteer's lack of experience may lead to errors 

committed during data collection or at the data treatment. The most detectable errors 

can be excluded, yet other less perceptible errors are often included in research data. On 

the other hand, these errors are rare and volunteers gain experience doing consecutive 

surveys. 

Additionally, sampling during the years analysed was not even for all locations, as 

coverage of the Cardigan Bay SAC was higher than for all other locations, since surveys 

outside this Special Area of Conservation only started in 2011 (Feingold and Evans, 

2014a; Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  The offshore area was also under-surveyed when 



35 
 

in comparison with the coastal area sampled. Time and money constraints as well as the 

poor weather conditions typical of this area contributed to the lower offshore coverage 

(Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).  

Using opportunistic platforms, namely the land-watches and the whale watching 

trips, the effort was most frequently concentrated in the New Quay bay and the coastal 

area of the Cardigan Bay SAC. However, these data gathering methods were the most 

frequently employed as they are a highly cost effective way to record dolphin sightings. 

One consequence of using these means frequently to acquire data is the overestimation 

of the core areas in almost all groups. In order to more accurately assess unbiased core 

areas, it is necessary to conduct more surveys at the other areas and less at the New 

Quay bay and the near shore area of the Cardigan Bay SAC. 

 

With the population's decrease in numbers in Cardigan Bay and the apparent shift 

in the individual's locations (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015), it is imperative to increase 

survey coverage in other areas of Cardigan Bay as well as the other areas where 

encounters occurred (north Anglesey, Liverpool Bay, Isle of Man).  

Prey availability also seems to be decreasing (Feingold and Evans, 2014a) and, as 

a result, measures that prevent overfishing should be implemented. Vessel speed and 

driver's behaviour should also be monitored by the authorities, in order to insure a lower 

level of disturbance towards the animals, as sometimes excesses may be committed, 

often out of ignorance for the established rules.

5. CONCLUSION 

 

The present study aimed to determine the home range of the bottlenose dolphins 

population of Cardigan Bay, in Wales. By comparing different groups, according to 

certain characteristics (gender, time of sighting, degree of dorsal fin markings and 

presence of offspring), it is possible to assess the areas that are more import to each 

group or to the entire population and ascertain which measures can be applied in order 

to decrease the impact exerted in these animals. 

 

MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon), the total area where the animals were sighted 

and KDE (Kernel Density Estimators), the locations the animals use more, were 

determined for each group and the pairs were compared. 

Regarding the comparison between females and males, the total area, mean home 

range and core area were slightly higher for males. The overlap areas were also similar. 

As a result there were no significant differences in spatial distribution in both sexes. The 

greater limitation was the greater number of females relatively to the number of males 

studied. Gender determination is hard to achieve for males when the genital area is not 

visible during the observation.  The presence of calves near an individual several times  

ensures an easier identification of female dolphins, but there is no such way to 

determine when a dolphin is male. 

When comparing sightings between April 1st to October 31s (summer) and 

November 1
st
 to March 31

st
 (winter), the locations obtained were quite different. The 

summer mean home range is located mostly in both SACs and in north Anglesey.  The 

core area is located in the coastal area of Cardigan Bay SAC. On the contrary, the 

winter home range is more disperse, with a lower presence in the Cardigan bay area and 

greater dolphin concentrations around Anglesey, near Liverpool Bay and at the Isle of 

Man. The winter core areas were located mostly at the northern coast of Anglesey and, 

on a lower level, at the Cardigan Bay SAC. The lack of constant survey coverage of the 

locations outside the Cardigan Bay area and, to an extent, outside the Cardigan Bay 

SAC limit the number of sightings used for this study. More surveys would probably 

lead to a much more reliable conclusion regarding these two groups.  

Animals with well marked dorsal fins were contrasted with dolphins without a 

marked dorsal fin. The areas overlapped, with further areas occupied by well marked 

individuals. However, this does not mean they are greater in numbers or expand in 



37 
 

greater areas. Well-marked animals are much easier to identify, whereas a non-marked 

dorsal fin is much harder to use as an identifiable feature. The areas estimated were the 

same but the well marked dolphins had a greater area since these animals are more 

easily identifiable. 

Concerning the females with calves vs females without calves, the females with 

calves do not seek different areas than the ones occupied by other females dolphins 

without calves. Instead, females without calves tend to spread further away offshore, 

occupying the whole bay area, while females with calves tend to stay closer to shore at 

more sheltered locations. This comparison was limited by the sometimes low number of 

sightings of mothers and calves as, in some years, encounters were not enough to 

determine of the female had a calve or not.  

When determining the mean depth for each group, most groups had similar depth 

ranges with similar standard deviations. The only noticeable difference was the winter 

depth, however the variation was not significant. The greater depth is in line with the 

fact that most dolphins are located outside the Cardigan Bay Area during the winter 

time. As some areas surrounding Anglesey are slightly deeper than the CB area, the 

depth would be slightly higher than at the summer home range locations.  

The core areas were mostly located at the coastal area of the Cardigan Bay SAC, 

as both land-based surveys and whale watching trips were conducted exclusively at this 

location. The effort regarding all the surveys conducted throughout the years was, as a 

result, much more concentrated around this area than all the remaining locations. In 

addition, due to several constraints, surveys were mostly conducted both during the 

summer time as well as inshore.  

Despite all the limitations, conclusions were drawn regarding the population 

studied.  

 

Regarding the similarity between females and males' home range, these results are 

similar to a previous masters thesis study on the relationship between reproductive 

success and home range (Baylis, 2013), conducted in the Cardigan Bay dolphins.  

The presence of individuals around Anglesey, near Liverpool Bay and at the Isle 

of Man is in line with previous works. Feingold and Evans (2014a) and Lohrengel and 

Evans (2015) have mentioned the presence of the Cardigan Bay dolphins in these areas 

as well as the conclusion that most animals spend the winter in the north and summer in 

the south.  



38 
 

The home range estimation regarding the presence of females and calves at the 

Pen Llyn a’r Sarnau  SAC is in line with a hypothesis from a previous work (Feingold 

and Evans, 2014a) that stated that this Special Area of Conservation was not only used 

for socialization and mating, but also as a nursery.  

The results obtained in this comparison correspond to the results found by Baylis 

(2013) that has stated that females with greater reproductive success tend to have 

smaller home ranges and core areas.  

The average depths determined were in opposition with results found in Sarasota 

Bay (Florida), where preferred depths were lower than 3 meters, however were closer to 

the average 30-50meters found at the Shannon Estuary (Ireland) (Ingram and Rogan, 

2002). 

 

As suggested by Feingold and Evans (2014a), genetic sampling would contribute 

to the increase in information regarding the population studied, mainly for gender 

determination. The use of underwater cameras would also be an important tool to both 

determine gender and, when close enough, determine other ways to identify an 

individual, particularly when the dorsal fin does not present visible marks or nicks. 

In addition, further surveys outside the Cardigan Bay SAC are required, mainly 

around Anglesey, as this location seems an important place for dolphin population. If 

this is the case, further protection measures are required for this region and possibly 

establishing a Special Area of Conservation, particularly for the north coast of this 

island. Other areas would also require further coverage, as Liverpool Bay, the Isle of 

Man and the Pen Llyn SAC, both during the winter and summer and specially the 

offshore areas of the two SACs. Furthermore, since dolphins were encountered outside 

both Special Areas of Conservation, other transects outside these areas could prove 

beneficial to estimating the real range of these individuals. 

Furthermore, further studies must be conducted on prey availability in the 

Cardigan Bay area, since prey seems to be decreasing (Lohrengel and Evans, 2015).    

This study is intended to be continued so other discoveries regarding this 

population can lead to its increase in numbers and habitat quality improvement.
