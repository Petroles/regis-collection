Resumo 

A criação e crescimento de moedas virtuais pelo mundo têm sido alvo de vários 

estudos e notícias divulgadas pelos media, especulando-se quanto à sua continuidade, 

aplicabilidade e segurança. Dessas moedas, destaca-se a Bitcoin, a moeda virtual que 

apresentou até hoje o maior valor de mercado e que se tem mantido em circulação há mais 

de 5 anos.  

O presente estudo tem como objetivo investigar a existência de uma relação 

dinâmica entre os preços da Bitcoin e indicadores económico-financeiros cuja relação 

com as moedas físicas é conhecida ou foi demonstrada em estudos anteriores. Esses 

indicadores são os preços do petróleo e do ouro, as taxas de juro a 6 meses e a 1 ano das 

obrigações do Tesouro americanas e os valores de fecho do índice S&amp;amp;P 500.  

Os resultados deste estudo demonstram que apenas as taxas de juro a 6 meses de 

obrigações do Tesouro americanas apresentam uma relação de longo prazo com as 

cotações da Bitcoin.  

 

 

 

Palavras-chave: bitcoin, não estacionariedade, cointegração, modelo vetorial de 

correção de erros.

Abstract 

The cryptocurrencies development around the world has been studied and published 

by the media, speculating on its continuity, applicability and security. The Bitcoin stands 

out as the virtual currency that has achieved the highest market value to date and for being 

in circulation for more than 5 years.    

This study intends to investigate the existence of a dynamic relationship between 

Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data whose relationship with physical 

currencies is known or it has been showed in previous studies. This data includes the 

Crude and Gold prices, the 6-month and 1-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;amp;P 500 

Index prices.  

The results of the study suggests that only the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields 

presents a long-term relationship with the Bitcoin prices.  

 

    

 

Keywords: bitcoin, nonstationarity, cointegration, vector error correction model.

Sumário Executivo 

O presente estudo visa analisar a existência de relação entre os preços da Bitcoin e 

indicadores económico-financeiros, definindo-a através da estimativa de um modelo. 

Adicionalmente, esta dissertação identifica um conjunto de caraterísticas que poderão 

impulsionar a procura desta moeda ou, pelo contrário, afastar os seus investidores.  

Atualmente, a introdução e desenvolvimento de moedas virtuais têm sido temas em 

foco dos investidores, das instituições financeiras e dos seus reguladores. O facto de a 

Bitcoin permanecer em circulação desde 2009, com maior destaque desde 2013, e ter 

vindo a apresentar valores de mercado históricos chama cada vez mais a atenção de 

estudiosos e investidores.  

Na realidade, vários estudos e notícias têm vindo a identificar vantagens e 

desvantagens à sua utilização, os quais poderão atrair os investidores mais conservadores 

e acautelar os mais entusiastas, respetivamente. Parte das vantagens apresentadas são a 

transparência, a segurança, os reduzidos custos de transação, o anonimato, a possibilidade 

de troca por bens ou serviços reais e a descentralização. Por outro lado, as desvantagens 

englobam, por exemplo, o uso indevido da autoridade discricionária, a associação da 

moeda a atividades ilegais, a instabilidade dos preços e falhas no anonimato e segurança 

das carteiras ou transações de Bitcoin.  

Inerente a estas caraterísticas está a permanência da Bitcoin ainda numa zona 

cinzenta da legislação e política monetária, na grande maioria dos países. Isto associado 

à atividade criminal em que a moeda tem sido envolvida, alertou as autoridades de 

segurança e as entidades reguladoras dos mercados monetários, nomeadamente a 

Financial Action Task Force e a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, deixando mais 

relutantes as entidades competentes quanto ao avanço para a sua regulamentação.  

Ainda assim, as cotações da Bitcoin têm apresentado uma tendência de crescimento, 

sendo o seu valor a 28 de agosto de 2017 de 4.332 USD, onde o valor máximo de 4.346 

USD foi registado no dia 17 de agosto de 2017.  

Certamente que seria aliciante identificar quais os fatores que têm vindo a 

impulsionar o aumento de valor desta moeda virtual e, ainda mais atrativo, é a 

identificação de dados que possam ser utilizados na sua estimativa e previsão. De notar 

que as cotações da Bitcoin têm sido estudados por vários autores, sob diferentes 

perspetivas, nomeadamente na tentativa de identificar bolhas nos preços, identificar qual 

a distribuição que melhor representa o comportamento da taxa de câmbio da Bitcoin, 

examinar as dinâmicas dos preços e prever a sua evolução futura.

Neste sentido, foi também através de estudos efetuados que demonstraram a 

existência de relação entre o valor de moedas físicas, como, por exemplo o Dólar 

americano, e determinados indicadores económico-financeiros, que foi feita a seleção das 

variáveis a utilizar neste estudo. Desta forma, as séries temporais consideradas são, além 

da taxa de câmbio XBT/USD, os preços do petróleo e do ouro, as taxas de juro a 6 meses 

e a 1 ano de obrigações do Tesouro americanas e os preços do índice S&amp;amp;P 500. Todos os 

preços estão expressos em USD e as taxas em percentagem.  

Depois de identificados o objetivo e as variáveis em estudo, importa compreender 

se se verifica relação no longo prazo entre a taxa de câmbio XBT/USD e cada uma das 

variáveis identificadas. Desta forma, consideram-se as bases metodológicas dos autores 

Perron (2005), Johansen (1991, 1995) e Granger (1969), compreendendo as respetivas 

três grandes parcelas: (i) em primeiro lugar, a identificação da presença de não-

estacionariedade e integração de primeira ordem nas séries temporárias em análise; (ii) 

em seguida, o teste de cointegração das combinações entre a taxa de câmbio XBT/USD 

e cada uma das restantes variáveis em estudo e, caso se verifique, a estimativa dos 

respetivos modelos vetoriais de correção de erros; e (iii) o teste de exogeneidade que, 

caso se verifique exogeneidade fraca, implicará a ausência de ajustamentos significativos 

na relação de longo prazo e, consequentemente, a impossibilidade de utilização do 

modelo para previsão da taxa de câmbio XBT/USD.  

Relativamente ao estudo da não-estacionariedade das séries, optou-se pela 

execução do breakpoint unit root test, uma vez que as representações gráficas parecem 

indicar a existência de quebras estruturais no comportamento da taxa de câmbio 

XBT/USD.  

Por outro lado, o teste de cointegração de Johansen foi efetuado para cada 

combinação de duas variáveis, isto é, para cada sistema entre as cotações da Bitcoin e 

cada uma das restantes variáveis consideradas. Desta forma, simplifica-se a interpretação 

dos resultados e permite-se concluir se existe relação, assim como, de que forma se 

relaciona cada uma das variáveis com a taxa de câmbio XBT/USD.  

No que respeita ao teste de exogeneidade, foi testada a presença de exogeneidade 

forte, para as variáveis com exogeneidade fraca, por forma a verificar a existência, ou 

não, de relação no curto prazo das respetivas variáveis.  

Desta forma, os resultados do estudo indicam que, embora se verifique cointegração 

entre as cotações da Bitcoin e as variáveis em análise, apenas as taxas de juro a 6 meses 

de obrigações do Tesouro americanas apresentam uma relação de longo prazo com as 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

3 
 

cotações da Bitcoin. Por outro lado, as cotações da Bitcoin e do ouro apresentam uma 

relação de curto prazo, visto ter sido apenas identificada exogeneidade fraca. 

De salientar que somente o modelo Vetorial de Correção de Erros estimado com as 

taxas de juro a 6 meses de obrigações do Tesouro americanas poderá ser utilizado para 

estimar os preços da Bitcoin, visto não apresentar exogeneidade. 

Por fim importa reter que, embora este estudo aponte para a possibilidade de 

utilização das taxas de juro a 6 meses de obrigações do Tesouro americanas para previsão 

das cotações da Bitcoin no curto prazo, outros inúmeros fatores e limitações da 

metodologia poderão contrariá-lo, nomeadamente o facto do teste de cointegração de 

Johansen assumir a inexistência de quebras estruturais.

1. Introduction 

Financial Markets cover a huge amount of information, activities and tools used by 

people in their quotidian actions or/and by organizations from all business areas. These 

Markets can be divided into three main categories: Money Markets, Exchange Markets 

and Capital Markets (Custódio et al, 2008).  

Focusing on the Exchange Markets segment, its basis is the purchase and sale of 

different national currencies, establishing a relative price – the exchange rate. Anyone 

who has travelled to countries with a different domestic currency is familiar with this 

concept. In these cases, as it is exemplified by Hoover (2012), people can buy the foreign 

currency in banks, kiosks in international airports, train stations or even in most cities on 

the relevant places. However, the same author refers that most foreign-exchange 

transactions do not involve tourists, but rather banks and nonfinancial companies engaged 

in foreign trade. Actually, foreign-exchange markets cover not only the exchange of real 

goods and services, but also of financial assets (Hoover, 2012), where the purchase and 

sale of currencies are included. Although these transactions could be done in a short time 

range and when there is a need, they can be used as an investment.  

Since exchange rates suffer appreciations and depreciations over time, there is an 

investment opportunity that does not come free of risk or of the cost of specialized 

analysis. The risk factors that are unique to international investments are exchange rate 

risk and political risk. (Bodie et al, 2011). 

An investor can take a profit when the foreign currency he holds appreciates relative 

to his national currency. He can sell the foreign currency and then, the value he will 

receive, in national currency, will be higher than what he paid to buy it. However, the 

exchange rate fluctuation can also result in losses, when the appreciated currency is the 

national one. Therefore, at an organization level, international financial managers are 

responsible for handling the continued high volatility of the relative values of currencies. 

Despite efforts to forecast foreign exchange behaviour, a wide range of economic, 

financial and speculative instabilities create major uncertainties (Copeland et al, 2005). 

In a crisis context, as the one that has affected the financial markets since 2008, these 

drivers are even more crucial. 

Nevertheless, it was during this unstable period that the Bitcoin (XBT) emerged. 

Undoubtedly, it had a huge impact in exchange markets as we knew them. Bitcoin is a 

digital, decentralized, partially anonymous currency, not backed by any government or 

other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or other commodity (Grinberg, 2011). It

was created in 2009 (Bojanova et al, 2014) and it follows the white paper [50] of Satoshi 

Nakamoto (Chan et al, 2015), whose true identity no one knows.  

In Bloomberg, there are quotations of exchange rates XBT/USD and XBT/EUR 

since 1st December 2011 and 10th September 2013, respectively. Similarly to the physical 

currencies, Bitcoin is subject to volatility, although on a higher scale. Observing the 

historical prices of XBT/USD (see appendix A), it is possible to conclude that the 

maximum value of Bitcoin was registered at 17th August 2017, when 1 XBT was worth 

4.346USD. Looking back, at 29th November 2013, there was also a maximum value of 

1.137USD, followed by a huge depreciation. Indeed, since that date, the minimum value 

was recorded at 14th January 2015, when 1 Bitcoin was worth 185USD.  

In Portugal, despite the existence of some machines where is possible to buy 

Bitcoins, this topic does not deserve so much attention. One possible reason can be that 

the application of this digital currency is still not very expressive in the country. However, 

this tends to change with the growing media attention to this currency. It should be noted 

that several foreign authors have studied the Bitcoin prices under different perspectives, 

namely in the attempt to identify price bubbles, to identify the distribution that gives the 

best prices fit, to examine the prices dynamics and to forecast them in the future. With 

the continuous increase of Bitcoin prices, as well as the increase in the available 

observations number, the investigation related with it study becomes even more 

interesting.  

In this context, it would be appealing to identify what factors have been driving the 

Bitcoin prices increase and, even more attractive, to identify what data factors can be used 

to forecast them. Consequently, it arises the present dissertation “Virtual currency: A 

cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data”. The 

current study examines the long-run and short-run relationships between the exchange 

rate XBT/USD and other economic and financial factors. Objectively, this study explores 

the existence of a cointegration relationship between the variables. Additionally, it is 

estimated the vector error correction model which could be used (with lack of success, 

quite sure) to forecast the exchange rate XBT/USD.   

In fact, Engle &amp;amp; Granger (1987) defined the cointegration as a formulation of the 

phenomenon that nonstationary processes can have linear combinations that are 

stationary. Therefore, it will be considered the methodological approaches of Perron 

(2015), Johansen (1991, 1995) and Granger (1969), comprising the respective following 

steps: (i) testing the presence of non-stationarity and first-order integration in each time 



6 

 

series considered in this analysis; (ii) testing the cointegration between the exchange rate 

XBT/USD and each of the remaining variables under study; and (iii) testing the 

exogeneity, since a weak exonegeity will imply the absence of significant adjustments in 

the long-run relationship and, consequently, the preclusion of using the model to forecast 

the Bitcoin prices.  

Regarding the first step, it is applied the breakpoint unit root test, since there are 

signs of structural breaks in the behaviour of the Bitcoin prices.  

Next, it is computed the Johansen cointegration test for each combination of two 

variables, that is, for each system between Bitcoin prices and each of the other variables. 

In this way, the bivariate test simplifies the results interpretation, allowing to conclude 

whether there is a long-run relationship and how the variables are related to the exchange 

rate XBT/USD.  

Finally, it is tested the strong exogeneity, when the weak exogeneity is detected, in 

order to verify the existence, or not, of a short-term relationship between the variables 

that do not show a long-term equilibrium.  

The economic and financial data under analysis are the crude and the gold prices, 

the 6-month and the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index quotes. The 

reason for choosing these variables is that several studies have already showed their 

relationship with different physical currencies. Nevertheless, since Bitcoin is a virtual 

currency and there are many legal blanks with regard to this, it is expected that the impact 

of economic and financial instabilities should be lower than in physical currencies. Then, 

the tricky question is to understand if the data related to physical currencies also relate to 

virtual currencies, in this case the Bitcoin.  

Thereby, this thesis aims to present and discuss models to explain the relationship 

between the Bitcoin prices and the economic and financial data referred before.  

Indeed, the results showed that only the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields present a 

long-run relationship with the Bitcoin prices, being possible to use their rates to forecast 

the exchange rate XBT/USD in the short term. 

The Chapter 2. begins with an overview of the present status of the Bitcoin 

information and researches. It is split into eight sub-sections, including a brief description 

of Bitcoin, its exchange markets and prices, its users, its main advantages, its main 

disadvantages and risks, a comparison between physical and digital currencies, the 

current Bitcoin regulation and main studies performed and their conclusions. Chapter 3. 

presents the data considered in this study, their sources and why they were included.

Chapter 4. outlines the econometric specifications and procedures applied to the data, 

including the methodology and approaches under non-stationarity, cointegration and 

VEC Model and exogeneity. Chapter 5. shows the empirical findings and the Chapter 6. 

presents the conclusions.

2. Literature Review 

Bitcoin is a digital and decentralized currency which was created in 2009 (Bojanova 

et al, 2014). However, the Bloomberg platform only provides quotations of XBT/USD 

and XBT/EUR exchange rates since December 2011 and September 2013, respectively. 

This can be explained by the residual value of one Bitcoin during the first years of its life.  

On the other hand, given its recent creation and short life span, until recently, 

Bitcoin has not received that much attention. As the notoriety of Bitcoin has increased in 

the last few years, mainly due to the social media, by consequence the number of 

electronic documents and academic journals articles on it has follow the same path. Even 

so, the knowledge on Bitcoin still does not offer a lot of insights (Carrick, 2016).  

This chapter presents an overview of a body of research and the present status of 

the Bitcoin information.  

 

2.1. Bitcoin: A Virtual Currency 

According to the white paper of the Bitcoin’s creator, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, 

an electronic coin is defined as a chain of digital signature, where each owner transfers 

the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public 

key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the 

signatures to verify the chain of ownership [50]. 

Beginning by the way it works, Bitcoin is a digital currency system based on peer-

to-peer1 virtual data. The peer-to-peer network used to distribute a master transparent 

public ledger is also called blockchain (Harrel et al, 2017).  

On the other hand, Harrel et al (2017) described Bitcoin as a Proof-of-Work2 (PoW) 

based currency that allows users to generate digital coins by performing computations, in 

order to limit the replication of Bitcoins and to preserve their value.  

Additionally, as referred by Bojanova et al (2014), to use Bitcoins, individual must 

establish a Bitcoin ‘wallet’ on a computer. Therefore, Bitcoins can be transmitted to other 

user wallets using a combination of public and private key cryptology. According to 

                                                             
1 A Peer-to-Peer, or P2P, Economy is a decentralized model whereby two individuals interact to buy or 
sell goods and services directly with each other, without intermediation by a third-party, or without the 

use of a company of business [38]. 
2 Proof of work describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to 

deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of 

service attacks. The concept was adapted to money by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of "reusable 

proof of work." Proof of work forms the basis of most, though not all, other cryptocurrencies as well [39]. 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data

Gouriéroux et al (2015), there are three types of wallets: the software wallet, the mobile 

wallet and the web wallet. 

In their study, Harrel et al (2017) also explained that through the acquisition of a 

Bitcoin wallet and one or more Bitcoin addresses, they can be accumulated on a 

computer’s hard drive as electronic files or transferred just like an e-mail. By using a 

blockchain, each Bitcoin transaction is registered for all to see, protecting the Bitcoin 

network against fraud and ensure that the files are not counterfeited. The blockchain is 

used to verify that the identical Bitcoins haven’t been used in a previous transaction, there 

for preventing double-spending of the same Bitcoins.  

The same authors clarified that the money supply is determined by a specific type 

of data “mining” activity, which depends on the amount of resources (electricity and CPU 

time) that “miners” expend to solving specific mathematical problems. In this sense, the 

Bitcoin mining process involves repeatedly running a computationally intensive 

mathematical function (called a cryptographic hash function) on a set of randomly seeded 

inputs until a specific pattern pops up.  

Furthermore, Harrel et al (2017) mentioned that as of July 2016, the Bitcoin 

network hash rate (total number of hashes per second made by all players) is estimated to 

be in the neighbourhood of 1.432.000 trillion hashes per second (1.432.000 Thash/s), 

contrasted with the 2014 rate of approximately 30.000 trillion hashes per second (30.000 

Thash/s), increasing at an astonishing rate due to more efficient specialized mining 

hardware now available on the market. At this rate, Bitcoin has become one of the largest 

distributed computational efforts ever. 

As noted by Guadamuz et al (2015), it is important to note that Bitcoin concept has 

built-in scarcity because mining for coins becomes more difficult as time goes by and the 

market grows. The algorithms that produce new Bitcoin coins increase the amount of 

processing power necessary to create each new block, so producing new coins is more 

difficult. This difficulty is built into the system to in order to keep the total amount of 

Bitcoins at a maximum of 21 million. In practice, the first block “mined” was at difficulty 

1 and this is known as the genesis block. By June 2011, there were 131.301 blocks, 

making a total of 6.560.000 Bitcoins and a difficulty of 877.227. In June 2014, there were 

303.162 blocks with a total 12.800.000 Bitcoins in existence and a difficulty of over 10 

billion. At the time of their article writing, Guadamuz et al (2015) identified the existence 

of 359.657 blocks and just over 14 million Bitcoins had been “mined”, with a difficulty 

of over 47,5 billion, meaning that to  make a new block is 47 billion times more difficult 



10 

 

than it was for the initial block and four times more difficult than it was exactly one year 

before.  

Given its complexity, this topic has been increasingly studied by computer 

engineers and programming technicians.   

 

Following the Bitcoins creation, they can be bought and sold on trading websites 

known as “exchanges”, each of them are independently operated and accessible 24 hours 

a day, 7 days a week to a global clientele (Pieters et al, 2016). 

Harrel et al (2017) pointed that some centralized virtual currencies take the form of 

digital precious metals, such as e-Gold and Pecunix, where users exchange digital 

currency units ostensibly backed by gold bullion or other precious metals. Others exist 

within popular online games or virtual worlds, such as Farmville, Second Life, or World 

of Warcraft. Still others are online payment systems such as WebMoney and Liberty 

Reserve, which are available generally outside of specific online communities and 

denominate users’ accounts in virtual currency rather than U.S. Dollars, Euros or some 

other national currency. Decentralized systems such as Bitcoin, which is relatively recent, 

are growing rapidly. A network of sites and services, including exchangers who buy and 

sell virtual currencies in exchange for national currencies or other mediums of value, have 

developed around virtual currency systems, as well. 

Moreover, Pieters et al (2016) stated that Bitcoin has gained links to the physical 

goods economy over time as retailers – including Windows, Dell, Overstock, and gift 

card merchants – began accepting it as a form of payment, though not all use the same 

method. For example, Dell accepts direct Bitcoin payments, but Amazon instead provides 

digital gift cards which may be purchased with Bitcoin and then used to purchase goods 

on their website.  

Indeed, the analysis of Baek et al (2015) suggested that the Bitcoin returns are 

internally driven by buyers and sellers and are not influenced by fundamental economic 

factors.  

 

2.2. Exchange Markets and Bitcoin Prices 

In order to accommodate growing demand several exchanges have been created, 

offering exchanges between Bitcoin and traditional currencies, including the Euro and 

U.S. Dollar and other digital currencies. According to Grinberg (2011), they include 

Liberty Reserve, Pecunix, and WebMoney. Several sites provide transaction services, 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

11 
 

allowing individuals to keep, send, and receive Bitcoins without ever running the Bitcoin 

client on their own computers. This author also stated that the Mt. Gox3 seemed to be the 

most popular exchange with $10.000 in trading volume in March 2011, which had an 

easy to use website. It allowed sending Bitcoins through email, as Bitcoin Mail. In the 

other hand, Instawallet provides a website that allows individuals to create Bitcoin 

addresses, send Bitcoins to any address for free and check balances.  

Harrel et al (2017) referred that new entrants appear almost daily in the Bitcoin 

ecosystem and include exchanges, transaction services providers, market information and 

chart providers, escrow providers, joint mining operations and so on. However, absent 

from this ecosystem at present are futures markets and entities offering legitimate 

investment returns, such as fractional reserve banks, although some individuals have 

announced plans to build these. Their article also gives some examples of these well-

funded entrants, as Coinbase which was founded in June 2012 as a Bitcoin wallet and 

platform where merchants and consumers can transact. Led by venture capital firm 

Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase received a validation of concept and an initial $25 

million investment. Coinbase lists contributed July 2016 capital of $1,06 million, and 

other metrics as: 3.200.000 users, 42.000 merchants, U.S. bank integration, 800.000 

consumer wallets and 8.000 developer applications. 

These exchanges have acquiring special importance, since late adopters and 

interested individuals cannot hope to mine new coins and, therefore, the Bicoin economy 

relies on users buying Bitcoins with fiat currencies4 through exchanges (Guadamuz et al, 

2015). 

Moreover, it was also introduced in the market “Bitcoin ATM machines”. They 

were available in Canada, London, Seattle, Washington and Austin (Texas) as of early 

2014, and this availability had grown to 560 machines worldwide by early 2016, with 239 

located in the United States (Harrel et al, 2017). 

 

                                                             
3 Mt. Gox was one of the earliest and most public downfalls of the Bitcoin era. In early 2014, Mt. Gox stood 
atop the field of Bitcoin exchanges as the largest, until it declared bankruptcy following the disappearance 
of almost $500 million Bitcoins and cash from its coffers. Some 200.000 of those Bitcoins were eventually 

found, leaving 650.000 still missing. In the time since, many analysts, former Mt. Gox investors, and others 

have speculated as to where the missing currency is. This is particularly important as Bitcoin's price has 

soared in recent months: the missing Bitcoins could be worth as much as $2 billion at this point [41]. 
4 Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical 
commodity [36]. 
 



12 

 

Given the many different Bitcoin exchanges available, each with varying popularity 

and currencies that Bitcoin is denoted in, Urquhart (2016) resorted to the 

www.bitcoinaverage.com, to collect data to its study. This is the first aggregated Bitcoin 

price index that aggregates rates from all available Bitcoin exchanges around the world 

and provides a volume weighted average Bitcoin price, enabling a worldwide perspective 

on the price and therefore efficiency of Bitcoin. At present Bitcoin adoption can be 

measured with varying degrees of accuracy across a variety of metrics, such as number 

of wallets, number of Bitcoin accepting businesses, number of transactions and exchange 

trading volume (Hileman, 2015). 

Several studies had being performed indicating that Bitcoin users must be exposed 

to exchange rate fluctuations, as exhibited in appendix A. Indeed, fluctuating Bitcoin 

prices have attracted media attention and have been associated with billions of dollars of 

trading volume. The exchange rate for Bitcoin to fiat currencies is determined by supply 

and demand and there is no governmental authority or company making guarantees about 

its value. (Athey et al, 2016). 

On a different note, Carrick (2016) emphasized the currencies influence from news 

sources. It is common knowledge that information disseminated to the public influences 

the supply and demand of currencies. For most currencies, the value is determined by the 

markets, which relies on information to determine the price. Various studies have looked 

at the effect of news announcements on currency prices, most of these studies looked at 

the volatility that was linked to the news. In spite of no study has looked specifically at 

Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, the Carrick's article mentions that news and 

information on the internet seems to influence the price of Bitcoin and, overall, the 

literature shows that the forces influencing fiat currencies apply to Bitcoin. 

In fact, there are communication channels spread around the world that report 

maximum values reached by Bitcoin, such as “O Jornal Económico” [25], “BBC” [7] and 

“CNN” [56], also more in-depth articles on Bitcoin can be found, for example, in 

“Forbes” [26]. 

 

2.3. Bitcoin Users 

According to Grinberg (2011), individuals holding this currency represent a number 

of interests, including technology early adopters, privacy and cryptography enthusiasts, 

government-mistrusting “gold bugs”, criminals and speculators.  



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

13 
 

On the other hand, the article of Guadamuz et al (2015) refers that the average 

Bitcoin user is a 32-year-old libertarian male, motivated by curiosity, profit and politics. 

Additionally it is mentioned that computer science and illegal activity were some of the 

most prevalent topics linked with Bitcoin, with less correlation to political discourse and 

investment. The same authors also affirmed that an important core of the Bitcoin 

community consists of libertarian types of all stripes, from those who want to see the end 

of all fiat currencies, to slightly more moderate and pragmatic supporters. 

Given the existence of group of Bitcoin enthusiasts and users, a large number of 

online merchants is currently accepting Bitcoins, catering to individuals with these 

interests, including web hosts, online casinos, illicit drug marketplaces, auction sites, 

technology consulting firms, and adult media and sex toy merchants. Farther, a number 

of non-profit organizations such as Wikileaks accept donations in Bitcoin. And a small 

handful of retail businesses accept Bitcoins, even if there is little indication that these 

retail establishments are significant (Grinberg, 2011). Likewise, Harrel et al (2017) 

mentioned in their article that by mid-year 2014, at least 65.000 global companies had 

announced acceptance of Bitcoins, including DISH Network, online travel site Expedia 

and Dell, which alone had nearly $57 billion in 2013 sales. 

 

Alternatively, in the first attempt to provide a rigorous answer to the question of 

where a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has the most and the least relative potential for 

adoption, Hileman (2015) introduced a new composite indicator that ranks Bitcoin’s 

potential utility across 178 countries - the Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI). Some 

of the 40 BMPI variables are likely to have a greater degree of influence over Bitcoin 

adoption than other variables and these variables were therefore afforded additional 

weight in the index. A variety of factors were considered in determining variable 

weightings. 

The results showed that the 10 countries with the highest relative potential for 

Bitcoin adoption according to the Bitcoin Market Potential Index are Argentina, 

Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Malawi, United States, Belarus, Nigeria, Congo, Iceland and Iran 

by the standardized method. The index rankings re-scaled data are broadly similar to 

standardized results. 

Given the BMPI’s criteria it is not surprising to see Argentina ranked number one. 

The country suffers from persistently high inflation, has a large informal economy and 

regularly experiences financial crisis. In addition, Argentina has a relatively high degree 



14 

 

of technology penetration and controls on the movement of capital. Argentina also 

recently defaulted on its sovereign debt for the second time in 13 years. 

The same author also mentioned a country that often features in Bitcoin discussions, 

which is ranked 27th - China. China’s BMPI ranking is lowered by its relatively-small 

black market and fewer recent financial crises. For some time, Bitcoin exchanges have 

reported Yuan-Bitcoin trading volume well in excess of the second most active currency 

pair, Dollar-Bitcoin. However, non-Chinese nationals are free to trade Yuan-Bitcoin on 

exchanges, and there are unconfirmed rumours that self-reported Bitcoin exchange 

trading volume is significantly inflated for marketing purposes.  

Near the bottom of the overall BMPI rankings at number 169 is Ireland. While 

Ireland scores well in some categories, such as technology and Bitcoin penetration, the 

country has wrestled with deflationary pressures in recent years and also has a relatively 

limited set of restrictions on the flow of capital. Following a similar perspective, Portugal 

is in the 123rd BMPI rank. 

Lastly, it should be noted that it is unclear how to score Bitcoin regulation and it 

has therefore been excluded from the BMPI. Nevertheless, a more aggressive Bitcoin 

regulation in countries such as Ecuador and Bolivia may ultimately serve as a significant 

barrier. 

 

2.4. Main Bitcoin Advantages 

Based on the various studies on Bitcoin, there are a number of advantages that this 

cybercurrency presents. 

i) Transparency: All transactions are publicly available and verifiable in the 

electronic ledger called the blockchain, providing an unprecedented level of transparency 

and peer verification. It is one of the features that transcends currency elements 

(Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

ii) Security: Bitcoin uses the 256-bit version of the secure hash algorithm (SHA), 

an encryption protocol designed by the U.S. National Security Agency. The protocol 

maintains the integrity of the blockchain, but is also used to sign and secure Bitcoin 

wallets, providing a mathematical proof that transactions are performed from the owner 

of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody 

once it has been issued (Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

iii)  Lower transaction costs: One of the main advantages of Bitcoin is that its 

transactions are open to the public and, as there are no intermediates involved, supposed 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

15 
 

to be without transactions fees. In fact, the system usually has transaction fees that vary 

from one exchange to the other. Even with these fees, which go to the miner as an 

incentive, Bitcoin still boasts lower transaction costs when compared to other payment 

methods. Some merchants estimate that the average is at one percent, as opposed to other 

intermediary clearinghouses such as PayPal and Western Union, which charge from two 

to four percent. However, it must be noted that some researchers believe that low 

transaction costs will not sustainable in the future (Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

This is especially relevant to improve the quality of life for the world’s poorest, 

enabling migrants to make cheaper remittances of payments to their families in 

developing countries. Indeed, the World Bank estimates that such remittances totalled 

$582 billion in 2015, of which $432 billion went to developing countries, involving some 

232 million migrants. By 2016, data shows that world remittances have grown to more 

than $601 billion, with developing countries receiving over $440 billion (Harrel et al, 

2017). 

iv)  Anonymity: Bitcoin is theoretically anonymous. A person in possession of 

Bitcoin in an encrypted wallet can spend it in any service without identification 

(Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

v) Resilience: Since Bitcoin is a decentralized currency with no central authority 

and no issuing body, it is resilient to attacks and in theory it also cannot be brought down 

(Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

vi)  Engine for innovation: While it is easy to ignore some criticisms made to 

Bitcoin, it cannot be denied that its creation has given a much needed push towards 

innovation in the way in which we think about money, financial institutions and centrality 

(Guadamuz et al, 2015).  

vii) Real-life payments: In contrary to the most virtual currencies, Bitcoin can be 

exchanged for real-life goods and services on a limited basis (Pandey et al, 2014).  

viii)  Decentralized markets: Blockchains compete with banks as organizations, 

enabling banking transactions to shift out of centralized hierarchical organizations and 

back into decentralized markets. As blockchain technologies work through banking, at 

the margins of measurement, monitoring and new forms of automated governance, they 

will enable a deeper process of institutional evolution to begin to unfold (Allen et al, 

2016). In Baek et al’s perspective (2015), Bitcoin is a panacea to replace financial 

institutions, an alternative to cash and a hedge against economies with rampant inflation. 

 



16 

 

2.5. Main Bitcoin Disadvantages and Risks 

In contrast to the advantages presented above, there is also a set of disadvantages 

or risks identified by some authors.  

i) Improper use of discretionary authority: Bitcoin is believed to have no central 

institution with discretionary authority to increase the money supply more quickly than 

the inflation rate built into the software. However, either the developers or a “convincing 

coalition”5 could probably exercise discretionary authority to change the inflation rate. 

Such an exercise of discretion, even if done with good intentions and supported by a 

majority of Bitcoin users, may nevertheless cause many individuals to lose confidence in 

Bitcoin and sell off their holdings, starting a panic (Grinberg, 2011). 

ii) Government crackdown: Currently the Bitcoin system fails to satisfy the 

“Misean Regression Theorem,” which explains that money becomes accepted not 

because of a government decree or social convention, but because it has its roots in a 

commodity expressing a certain purchasing power (Harrel et al, 2017). Although Bitcoin 

may be difficult to shut down because of its decentralized nature, a government 

crackdown on Bitcoin may nevertheless cause a crisis of confidence, especially if many 

Bitcoin users do not want to own a currency that is associated with criminality (Grinberg, 

2011). 

iii)  Illegal activity:  Illegal transactions were one of the first economic activities 

where Bitcoin gained use as an alternative currency due to its relative anonymity, 

efficiencies and other conveniences (Hileman, 2015). According to Harrel et al (2017), 

the evolution of virtual currencies has suffered from a highly visible connection to 

criminal activities including: attacks on businesses and corporate extortion, child and 

sexual exploitation, pornography, corporate espionage, illicit drug distribution, 

commerce in fake identifications and passports, investment fraud, stolen credit cards, 

terrorism and trafficking in weapons. The U.S. Secret Service believes the reasons of 

digital currencies preference by criminals are: anonymity for both users and transactions, 

ability to quickly and confidently move illicit proceeds from one country to another, 

widespread adoption in the criminal underground and trustworthiness. Actually, on 

January 16, 2014, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced 

the forfeiture of 29,655 Bitcoins (worth approximately $28 million) and the forfeiture of 

the Silk Road hidden website, which was just one of several anonymous networks that 

                                                             
5 This is, a group that releases a compatible version of Bitcoin with different inflation settings and convinces 
a majority of users to switch (Grinberg, 2011). 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

17 
 

became possible with the advent of relatively easy-to-use browser interfaces (Harrel et 

al, 2017). This bad reputation has a negative and direct impact on the Bitcoin users' 

confidence. 

One of the most recent and widely publicized criminal actions involving Bitcoin 

was the HBO files theft, including what appear to be scripts from five “Game of Thrones” 

episodes, by hackers who demanded millions in Bitcoins [57].  

iv)  Instability: Bitcoin has been tremendously unstable throughout its trading 

history. Indeed, the currency has crashed several times and the price continues to swing 

up and down repeatedly. Such instability is one of the reasons why it is very unlikely to 

be a viable currency. With wild variations in price, it is possible to lose money even before 

some transaction has been completed. This makes it too unstable and seems to be keeping 

away investors, making it an unreliable means of payment (Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

v) Deflationary spiral: Also related with the instability, Bitcoin might undergo a 

deflationary spiral that causes certain individuals or industries to abandon Bitcoin, 

possibly causing a panic or just a permanent depression in Bitcoin’s value. Since the upper 

limit of Bitcoins is fixed at 21 million, Bitcoins will become more valuable over time as 

the supply of government-backed fiat currencies continue to increase. As prices 

denominated in Bitcoins fall, producers may respond by lowering production, leading to 

lower wages, lower demand, and further decreases in prices. The end result of such a 

spiral is underemployed human capital and other means of production and destruction of 

wealth. Thus, industries using Bitcoin that fall into such a spiral may decide to abandon 

Bitcoin. Even the possibility of such a spiral may limit Bitcoin’s reach (Grinberg, 2011). 

vi)  Anonymity failure: All Bitcoin transactions are public, but are considered 

anonymous because nothing ties individuals or organizations to the accounts that are 

identified in the transactions (Grinberg, 2011). Since the currency is encrypted, there is 

theoretically no method to trace any given transaction to individual users (Guadamuz et 

al, 2015).  

However, Guadamuz et al (2015) stated that many papers express serious doubts 

on the much-heralded anonymity present in Bitcoin. If any of this information was 

publicly available, or accessible by, say, law enforcement agencies, then the identities of 

users involved in related transactions may also be at risk. The same authors mentioned a 

case study, where it was considered a highly-publicised theft of 25.000 Bitcoins, with a 

value at the time of theft of approximately US$ 500.000. On this case, it was possible to 

follow the involved transactions using network tools and charted these with high level of 



18 

 

accuracy. Therefore, it was concluded that using network analysis and network 

representation it is possible to map many users to their public keys. Grinberg (2011) also 

underlined that such unexpected and sudden exposure would obviously be deleterious to 

Bitcoin’s value.  

vii) Lack of security: As referred by Grinberg (2011), keeping Bitcoins on one’s 

computer can be as dangerous as keeping large sums of cash in one’s physical wallet, and 

each user should take care to backup and secure his Bitcoin wallet. A large-scale theft of 

Bitcoins from many users could create a confidence crisis, similar to what happened with 

Mt. Gox in 2014 [41]. 

viii)  Denial of service: Although Bitcoin is decentralized and generally has no 

single point of failure, it is nevertheless susceptible to a form of denial of service attack. 

Individuals with a majority of the computational power in the Bitcoin mining network 

can effectively preclude any transaction from being processed. Such a sustained attack 

might significantly depress the exchange rate and lead to a collapse of confidence. 

Actually, several parties might have sufficient interest to do it: governments who want to 

shut Bitcoin down, individuals with future liabilities in Bitcoins, or hackers who want to 

blackmail a business that relies on Bitcoins (Grinberg, 2011). 

ix) Lack of transparency: A main selling points of Bitcoin is transparency. The 

addresses do not identify the person, only the possessor of the key that unlocks the 

address, what makes it both anonymous and transparent at the same time. However, this 

transparency is in practice limited when one considers the currency’s origins. Satoshi 

Nakamoto, the fabled originator of the scheme, remains anonymous to this day. The fact 

that some investors have amassed large Bitcoin fortunes is an indication that this could 

be used to leverage the market. There have been several examples of possible market 

manipulation, with sudden large volumes in trade used to shift the price up or down. For 

such a transparent currency from a technical standpoint, this remains a rather difficult 

area for outsiders (Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

x) Lack of replicability: Most Bitcoins exist only as files in a computer or mobile 

device. This creates one of the biggest issues with Bitcoin to date: the ease of losing one. 

If the wallet file is lost, then the Bitcoins it contains are lost forever. It must be said that 

missing and lost coins has not been seen as a problem for enthusiasts, as they point out 

that each Bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal points. However, this difficulty will only 

go up, so an individual cannot hope to have the processing power to develop new coins, 

since this can only be done currently through pool mining CPU resources. While this

model is trying to replicate scarcity in the market, it acts as a punishing disadvantage for 

late adopters, and means that early adopters have market power if they hoarded coins 

(Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

xi) Growing centrality: One of the foundational principles of Bitcoin is its 

decentralized nature. Assuming that thousands of people are mining separately, the 

system remains decentralized and the prospect of a single entity gaining control of the 

network was seen as very remote. However, in June 2014 two computer scientists from 

Cornell University stated that a large mining conglomerate was becoming too powerful, 

and had actually reached 51 percent of all mining capacity for Bitcoin during a few hours. 

Essentially the system was no longer decentralized. More pragmatic developers have 

proposed technical solutions. However, the truth is that until a long-term technical 

solution is reached, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature relies entirely on the good will of 

miners. If Bitcoin in its present shape reached an important share of the financial market, 

it would be possible for an entity with substantial computing power to take over the entire 

system. The prospect of a government or corporation taking over Bitcoin would be a real 

threat (Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

xii) Computational inefficiency: A less-explored area of concern with Bitcoin is 

that, at least as currently implemented, it might be energy inefficient. Bitcoin generates 

value by requiring those who participate in the network to dedicate computing power to 

verify transactions. This presents two problems for the scalability of the network, namely 

the computational power required to mine Bitcoins and the size of the blockchain itself. 

Indeed, the computational power dedicated to mining has continued to increase over time 

and there are some authors believing that the cost of Bitcoin mining on commodity 

hardware now exceeds the value of the rewards (Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

xiii)  Superior competing currency: A superior competing currency could lead to a 

crisis of confidence causing either a collapse of Bitcoin’s value or merely a permanent 

reduction of Bitcoin’s value. As stated by Grinberg (2011), Bitcoin has at least two classes 

of competitor products, which are products that facilitate internet-based commerce and 

gold-backed currencies. The first one can be divided into three sub-types: traditional e-

commerce, micropayments and the virtual world and game-related commerce. In practice, 

the same author referred that Bitcoin is unlikely to make significant headway in the 

traditional ecommerce market because consumers generally do not care about the kind of 

anonymity that Bitcoin provides, prefer to compare prices of most goods and services in 

a currency they are familiar with and want fraud protection, which Bitcoin currently lacks. 



20 

 

However, Bitcoin may be specially competitive in the micropayment and virtual world 

markets, where consumers care less about pricing in a familiar currency. Bitcoin is likely 

to be attractive to those who like gold-backed currencies because its value depends on the 

availability of a limited resource rather than discretionary actions by central bankers.  

In the article of Harrel et al (2017), it was also mentioned that as of July 15, 2016, 

Coinmarketcap.com listed 656 different cybercurrencies, having a total market 

capitalization of approximately $13.011 billion, where Bitcoin was in the 1st place with 

$10.501 billion. 

Additionally, Guadamuz et al (2015) stated that Amazon has announced that it will 

be launching its own virtual currency for their Kindle app store, Amazon Coins.  These 

authors also identified some of the most popular implementations, with some 

improvements relative to Bitcoin, standing out the following ones:  

• IxCoin: It is the first Bitcoin clone. It was released in 2011 and it can be mined 

at the same time as Bitcoin. It also has a limit of 21 million coins, but much shorter mining 

period (all coins should have been mined in 2015).  

• Namecoin: It is one of the most innovative altcoins. It uses Bitcoin to create a 

decentralized domain name system outside of the existing international system operated 

by ICANN. The service allows the registration of domain names that cannot be shut down 

or taken over by law enforcement.  

• Litecoin: This is one of the more popular Bitcoin alternatives, it was created 

specifically to fix perceived shortcomings in Bitcoin, and it boasts faster transaction 

verification times and improved storage efficiency.  

• Bitcoin XT: This is a very recent and controversial fork to the original Bitcoin 

source code that adds two main changes, the block size is increased and it removes the 

need to download the entire blockchain. 

 

2.6. Physical versus Digital Currencies 

According to Allen et al (2016), it is clear that beyond the physical storage of 

precious metals and other financial assets, a bank is a centralized ledger of transactions, 

whether of capital or payments, which records balances between many different parties. 

A bank, in the modern sense, is an internalized market: it is an organization that functions 

as a platform to match those with excess supply of capital (savers) with those with excess 

demand for capital (borrowers). In sum, banks exist as third party intermediating 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

21 
 

organizations, where the presence of opportunism in many transactions makes hierarchies 

and relational contracting more transaction cost efficient mechanisms of governance.  

On the other hand, the same authors also referred that a blockchain is a public 

decentralized ledger platform and, as a specific technology for digital currencies, it is a 

technical solution to the double-spending problem. Blockchains are best understood as a 

new institutional technology that makes possible new types of contracts and 

organizations. In this sense, blockchains look to have changed the comparative 

governance efficiencies by eliminating opportunism. Therefore blockchains, as 

institutional technologies, undermine the strong case for the economic efficiency of 

hierarchies and relational contracting over markets. If blockchains can eliminate 

opportunism they will, at least theoretically, outcompete traditional organizational 

hierarchies and relational contracts. 

Furthermore, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible in the same way cash transactions 

are irreversible (Grinberg, 2011). 

 

In the article of Guadamuz et al (2015), it is mentioned that modern fiat currencies 

have value based on the economic strength of the issuer. In some libertarian and anarchist 

circles, it is said that fiat money does not have any inherent value, but this fails to 

recognize that neither does the gold standard. Gold does not have intrinsic value, under 

the right circumstances gold could be valueless except as an industrial input. In fact, there 

is no such thing as inherent value, all value is dependent on circumstances. The value in 

fiat money arises from the law, the currency has the support of the government as 

sovereign and therefore it is supported by the economy of the territory where it is 

accepted.  

On the contrary, Bitcoin was devised as a non-fiat currency. In other words, its 

proponents claim that it has 'real' value. The value arises from computing power, that is, 

the only way to create new coins is by allocating distributed CPU power through 

computer programs named 'miners'. Another way of looking at the currency is that Bitcoin 

is simply allocating value arbitrarily to a program that performs the mathematical 

equations necessary to support the creation of a Bitcoin. It is a self-referential and circular 

currency, and its only value is that which people give it, just like fiat money, but with 

faith placed in computer programming, not sovereign states. 

Indeed, the vast majority of currencies are backed by governments (or other legal 

entities), commodities, or both. Unlike the U.S. Dollar, Bitcoin is not backed by the U.S. 



22 

 

Government or any other legal institution. It is a digital rather than paper currency, 

storable on electronic media and transferable over the internet (Grinberg, 2011). 

Even so, a growing ecosystem surrounds Bitcoin, including exchanges, transaction 

services providers, market information and chart providers, escrow providers, joint 

mining operations and so on. Additionally, individuals can send Bitcoins for free, but may 

add optional transaction fees to ensure their transactions are quickly processed. By 

contrast, credit card charges can be charged back to merchants. 

However, absent from this ecosystem at present are futures markets and entities 

offering legitimate investment returns, such as fractional reserve banks, although some 

individuals have announced plans to build these (Grinberg, 2011). Harrel et al (2017) also 

identified other Bitcoin issues such as the as the particularly difficult transactional, 

regulatory and law enforcement challenges caused by their anonymity due to encryption, 

their ability to transcend national borders in the fraction of a second and their unique 

jurisdictional issues. Moreover, in contrast to negotiable instruments, a virtual or 

cybercurrency is intangible and potentially ephemeral.  

Furthermore, at present, goods and services priced in Bitcoin units tend to see the 

number of Bitcoin fluctuate in lock-step with changes in Bitcoin’s exchange rate against 

a national currency, like the U.S. dollar. If Bitcoin was serving as a true, widely-used unit 

of account we would not expect to see such constant fluctuations in the number of Bitcoin 

required to complete a purchase. Further, Bitcoin is unlikely to become a widely used unit 

of account until either its relative volatility decreases and or it becomes more widely used 

as a medium of exchange (Hileman, 2015). 

In these regards, Athey et al (2016) added that Bitcoin also shares some features 

with risky assets where beliefs about the future underlying value of the asset evolve over 

time as information is revealed. 

In this sense, it is important to understand, based on the Bitcoin’s characteristics, 

what “security” does it match (if applicable).  

In fact, Grinberg (2011) developed this topic, comparing Bitcoin with Notes, 

Stocks, Investment Contracts, Commodities and Currencies. This author concluded that 

Bitcoin is not a “note” because it lacks the promise by the maker to pay a sum of money 

to another party. Similarly, it is not “stock” since it does not confer the right to receive 

dividends contingent upon an apportionment of profits neither vote rights.  

On the other hand, an investment contract has a broader definition: it is a contract, 

transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

23 
 

led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. Given this, 

the author concluded that, because there is likely no common enterprise, Bitcoin is 

unlikely to be an investment contract. Indeed, the individuals who choose to promote 

Bitcoin are independent of one another, and there is no one money-making business that 

seeks to raise money through investments. 

Next, “commodities” enter into the discussion. Grinberg (2011) put the hypothesis 

that Bitcoins are commodities, which are generally held not to be securities. Indeed, 

owning a Bitcoin gives one only rights to use the Bitcoin in any way one sees fit and to 

sell or make contracts involving that Bitcoin. However, decisions explaining why 

commodities are not securities have also noted that commodities are “tangible” and have 

“inherent value,” unlike securities. Bitcoins are not “tangible,” and one may argue that 

by design they have no inherent value because there is no government or commodity 

backing them. Thus, although Bitcoins share many features with commodities, they also 

share features with securities and are unlikely to evade categorization as an “investment 

contract” on this ground. As well, Guadamuz et al (2015) also presented this discussion. 

In fact, these authors mentioned that Bitcoin fulfils all of three security requirements, and 

therefore can easily be classified as such, at least until the law changes to classify it more 

adequately. Nevertheless, it would also be easy for Bitcoin to be treated as a commodity 

under the broad definition present in the Commodity Exchange Act 19366. 

Finally, only remains the “currency”. According to Harrel et al (2017), a functional 

approach to the definition of money is based on the observation of the three primary 

functions: (1) a means of exchange in terms of (2) a defined unit of account that is used 

as (3) a measure and store of value. 

The first requirement of a currency is that it can be used for transactions. At this 

stage, Carrick (2016) mentioned that there are thousands of websites that accept Bitcoin 

and in December of 2015, there were approximately 200.000 daily Bitcoin transactions 

per day, but this volume is tiny compared to other currencies. However, there are still 

many smaller recognized currencies that have far less daily volume. Overall, it is unclear 

whether Bitcoin meets the transactional requirement of a currency – this depends on the 

interpretation of this requirement. 

The second requirement of a currency is that is can be used as a unit of account. 

This is also debatable for Bitcoin. It clearly has unit of account characteristics. First, a 

                                                             
6 An act passed in 1936 by the U.S. Government that provides federal regulation of all futures trading 
activities. This act replaced the Grain Futures Act of 1922 [35].  



24 

 

Bitcoin can be divided into an infinite number of pieces, and these can be put back 

together to form a full Bitcoin. Second, Bitcoin is fungible since all Bitcoins are created 

equally and they can all be interchanged. Third, it is countable and subject to 

mathematical operations. Although Bitcoin seems to clearly meet the unit of account 

requirements, there is still debate on this. The debate primarily revolves around Bitcoin’s 

ability to value goods and services, given its volatility. However, many currencies incur 

extreme volatility and are still considered currencies (Carrick, 2016). 

The third requirement of a currency is that it be able to be used as a store value of 

account. Some authors have argued that Bitcoin’s volatility marginalizes its store value. 

To that point, many investors gauge the credibility of a currency by its stability and ability 

to be a safe haven when other financial assets are experiencing volatility (Carrick, 2016). 

At this stage, Grinberg (2011) referred that the narrow definition would likely 

exclude Bitcoins until Bitcoins become generally accepted in any geographical or 

political area. This leads to the need for Bitcoin regulation. 

 

2.7. Bitcoin Regulation 

Although Bitcoin may be more resistant to government attack because of its 

decentralized nature, many Bitcoin users, including both consumers and businesses, are 

anxious about its legal status. As mentioned before, actually Bitcoin operates in a legal 

grey area and one of its problems is the reluctance of regulatory authorities in some 

countries to approve it as a currency (Grinberg, 2011). 

A real case descripted in the article of Grinberg (2011) goes back to 1988, when 

Bernard von NotHaus started printing and distributing metallic and paper currency called 

Liberty Dollars. The currency was backed by gold, silver, or other precious metals, and it 

was intended to be inflation-proof, unlike the U.S. Dollar. The U.S. Mint warned 

consumers about the Liberty Dollar in 2006, NotHaus’s offices were raided by the FBI 

and Secret Service in 2007 and NotHaus was indicted in 2009 and convicted in March 

2011. In press releases related to the indictment and conviction, the Department of Justice 

made several statements that seemed extremely hostile to private currencies. 

Nevertheless, the statutes under which NotHaus was convicted, 18 U.S. Code §§ 485 and 

486 [48], are inapplicable to Bitcoin because they only deal with metal coins or coins or 

bars that resemble official U.S. or foreign currency. Nevertheless, some have mused that 

the attack on Liberty Dollar indicate that Bitcoin will be next.

Following this issue, there are some points generating the need for Bitcoin 

regulation, namely to discourage of anti-money laundering, applying know-your-

customer controls, and to minimize misinformation. 

Money laundering is the process by which dirty money, proceeds of illegal 

activities, is rendered clean, allowing the money to be used for legal activities. Terrorist 

financing is similar, except that it allows clean money to be used for illegal activities, and 

is often considered under the same umbrella as money laundering (Grinberg, 2011). The 

Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization that designs 

and promotes policies and standards to combat money laundering, creating 

recommendations which target is money laundering, terrorist financing and other threats 

to the global financial system. As of 2014 there are thirty-six members of the Financial 

Action Task Force. Most members are countries, though regional organizations, such as 

the European Commission, are also included. A large number of international 

organizations participate in the FATF as observers, each of which has some involvement 

in anti-money laundering activities, namely Interpol, the International Monetary Fund 

(IMF), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and World 

Bank are observers [37]. 

Digital currencies are attractive vehicles for money laundering because they allow 

fast, anonymous, through-the-Internet transfers. Thus, there is a serious question of 

whether the regulations and regimes in force impose legal risk for the Bitcoin developers, 

exchanges, ewallet providers, individual miners, operators of mining pools, mere Bitcoin 

users and businesses that accept Bitcoins (Grinberg, 2011). 

Additionally, like other commonly traded financial assets, information plays a 

major role in determining the price of Bitcoin, but unlike most other financial assets, the 

government cannot minimize the dissemination of misinformation. This has already hurt 

Bitcoin in the Mt. Gox incident where many false reports of the magnitude and cause of 

the failure were reported (Grinberg, 2011). 

Despite these forces, regulators and law enforcement officials face difficult 

technical challenges in obtaining evidence for law enforcement purposes, e.g., relating to 

potential links between crime, sophisticated encryption and virtual currency (Harrel et al, 

2017).  

The flip side to government oversight is that governments could make Bitcoin 

inefficient, and even worse in the eyes of Bitcoin’s creators, governments could take it 

over and essentially make it a fiat currency. Some legal scholars suggest that there is 



26 

 

middle ground, suggesting that governments could take an active role in regulation 

without taking it over, essentially by taking a role in monitoring Bitcoin markets the way 

they do with stock exchanges (Carrick, 2016). 

In a different note, Guadamuz et al (2015) constructed the following scenarios for 

virtual currencies: 

i) “Virtual sovereigns”: virtual currency providers will serve as regulators by 

enforcing the terms of their contracts with users to prevent cyber-fraud and ensure proper 

behaviour. 

ii) Prohibition: governments could try to block their citizens from using virtual 

currencies that do not abide by government restrictions and regulations (governments 

have not been able to completely block access to websites nor will total prohibition on 

virtual currencies succeed). 

iii)  Selective prohibition: government minimize the real-world impact of virtual 

currencies by, for instance, banning the sale of real-world goods for virtual currency. This 

section would also cover the banning and/or criminalization of the use of the currency to 

pay for illegal activities or for money laundering.  

iv)  Selective regulation: regulators impose some restrictions to specific aspects of 

virtual currencies, such as taxation and the regulation of intermediaries.  

v) “Real-world assisted virtual currency self-governance”: governments provide 

support for mechanisms whereby users of virtual currencies can agree upon and enforce 

their own ‘community standards’ and rules of conduct. 

 

So far, several authors have mentioned the position of the American regulatory 

institutions. Grinberg (2011) mentioned the statement of the Department of Justice, in a 

press release, that the creation of private coin or currency systems to compete with the 

official coinage and currency of the United States is a violation of federal law. However, 

organizations have been issuing a certain type of private currency in the U.S. for decades. 

Government officials have known about these currencies and have commented that they 

seem to pose no threat. 

Harrel et al (2017) also referred that, while the U.S. Government Accountability 

Office (GAO) has observed that there are no legal definitions for a virtual economy or 

currency, the GAO also has stated that a virtual currency is generally a digital unit of 

exchange that is not backed by a government-issued legal tender. On the other hand, the 

U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) defines virtual currency as a 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

27 
 

medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not 

have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. So far, in the United States, the FinCEN only 

issued guidelines specified that decentralized currencies should comply with money 

laundering regulations. 

Indeed, in the United States, only the U.S. Dollar is legal tender. Similarly, only the 

Mint and the Federal Reserve can produce coins and currency, which are the only means 

of legal tender. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it is a violation 

of federal law for individuals or organizations to create private coin or currency systems 

to compete with the official coinage and currency of the United States. It would seem 

clear that local currencies that may compete with the dollar are not allowed, but the 

question of whether Bitcoin can be considered a currency for these purposes is not clear. 

On the contrary, there have been electronic payment systems in existence for over a 

decade and there have not been attempts to curb them by using counterfeiting legislation 

(Guadamuz et al, 2015). 

According to Harrel et al (2017), the Bitcoin Foundation, founded by seven of the 

community’s most instrumental individuals, such as Gavin Andresen - a core Bitcoin 

developer, has been registered under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code in Washington, 

D.C.. Its bylaws were effective as of July 23, 2012. The Foundation is governed by a 

board with five seats split by membership class. Two seats elected by the Individual 

member class, two seats by the Corporate member class and one seat by the Founding 

member class.  

Moreover, the same authors referred that in January 2014, the Uniform Law 

Commission (ULC) created a Study Committee on Alternative and Mobile Payments (the 

Study Committee). The focus of the Study Committee is to devise an optimal licensing 

system for intermediaries that perform financial services for third parties relating to 

digital or virtual currencies. The Study Committee received extensive input from a variety 

of sources, including: the American Bankers Association; The Clearing House; the 

European Central Bank, the Senate of Canada, Standing Committee on Banking, Trade 

and Commerce; and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

Additionally, one of the major advances in the Bitcoin regulation in the U.S.A. was 

also described by these authors and it had the first step in August 2013, when the New 

York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) announced its inquiry into the 

appropriate regulatory guidelines for virtual currencies. The proposal, first published in 

the July 23, 2014 edition of the New York State Register, triggered a series of comment 



28 

 

periods. The final DFS rule was published in the New York State Register’s June 24, 

2015 edition. It may be summarized as including requirements that relate to: anti-money 

laundering issues, consumer protection concerns and cyber security rules. Additionally it 

includes requirements and provisions for Safeguarding Consumer Assets, Virtual 

Currency Receipts, Consumer Complaint Policies, Consumer Disclosures, Anti-money 

Laundering Compliance (Verification of Account holders and the Reporting of Suspected 

Fraud and Illicit Activity), a Cyber Security Program, a Chief Information Security 

Officer, Independent DFS Examinations, Books and Records, Reports and financial 

Disclosures, Audit Requirements, Capital Requirements, a Compliance Officer, Business 

Continuity and Disaster Recovery, Notification of Emergencies or Disruptions and 

provisions for a Transitional Period.  

Following release of the rule, outlining the final DFS BitLicense requirements, the 

DFS announced approval of the first BitLicense application on September 22, 2015. 

 

In contrast, the situation in Europe and the U.K. is less ambiguous than in the U.S. 

There is considerably more regulatory acceptance for alternative currencies to those 

issued by central banks authorities. While Bitcoin is larger by many degrees of magnitude, 

there does not seem to be any indication from regulators and central banking authorities 

in Europe that there will be a crackdown on Bitcoin over its legal status (Guadamuz et al, 

2015). 

On the other hand, according to Guadamuz et al (2015), there is a high threshold 

for an electronic money institution, as the electronic money institutions (EMI) would have 

to fulfil quite a number of requirements. The idea behind this stringent regulation is 

evident, as what is taking place is the issuing of value into the economy. If Bitcoins are 

not an EMI in Europe, then their status as currency is in doubt. The European Banking 

Authority (EBA) has opined that virtual currencies do not fulfil many of the requirements 

of a currency, and therefore should not be considered legal tender. While it does not state 

directly, the EBA opinion infers Bitcoin being a commodity that can be exchanged for 

fiat money. Despite this, the European Banking Authority issued a report on virtual 

currencies, as well as a detailed number of possible regulatory responses to the challenges 

posed by virtual currencies. However, they are only proposals. 

Indeed, Europe has already in place a legal framework for the regulation of 

electronic money, which could be used to cover virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. The 

Directive 2009/110/EC, of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

29 
 

2009, contains rules for all sorts of electronic purses that can be used to store value in an 

electronic format, be it via a computer, a mobile device or online. The Directive defines 

electronic money thus: 

i) electronically, including magnetically, stored monetary value;  

ii) as represented by a claim on the issuer which is issued on receipt of funds for 

the purpose of making payment transactions;  

iii)  the transaction is an act, initiated by the payer or by the payee, of placing, 

transferring or withdrawing funds, irrespective of any underlying obligations between the 

payer and the payee;  

iv)  which is accepted by a natural or legal person other than the electronic money 

issuer. 

Also in the U.K., Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) issued a briefing 

paper detailing its position on the tax treatment of income received from, and charges 

made in connection with, activities involving Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies. 

The HMRC recognizes that this is an evolving regulatory area and is expecting that at 

some point there will be some sort of EU-wide effort to define and clarify 

cryptocurrencies in general. HMRC has decided to treat income from sales of goods and 

services through Bitcoin in the same manner as it does any other sales (Guadamuz et al, 

2015). 

 

For the rest of the world, Guadamuz et al (2015) referred that China has been the 

only jurisdiction to successfully attempt a major crackdown of Bitcoin. However, it must 

be said that while the Chinese crackdown had some adverse effects on the use of Bitcoin 

as a currency, it is still being traded in China and the most active exchange is Chinese. 

On the other hand, Pieters et al (2016), mentioned that in July 2014 Ecuador banned 

Bitcoin, while the Isle of Mann merely clarified the application of existing tax rules. 

Lastly, Harrel et al (2017) also stated that during recent months, blockchain 

technology has continued to gain validation by an announcement of a partnership 

including nine of the world’s largest banks, proof of a concept experiment by Bank of 

Canada and an announcement that a Chinese digital currency will be issued as soon as 

possible.

2.8. Theories, Studies and Conclusions 

The article of Cheung et al (2015) was based on the development of Phillips, Shi &amp;amp; 

Yu (2013) methodology, a procedure designed to detect stochastic of a given time series 

because such explosive behaviour is usually deemed as a key feature of a bubble. The 

selected data was daily Bitcoin prices over the period 17th July 2010 to 18th February 

2014, collected from the www.bitcoincharts.com website, for the Mt. Gox Exchange. 

Their results showed a number of short-lived bubbles but most importantly, they found 

three huge bubbles in the latter part of the period (2011-2013) lasting from 66 to 106 days 

the last of which led to the demise of the Mt. Gox exchange. The bursting of these bubbles 

also seems to coincide with certain major events that occurred in the Bitcoin market. 

Therefore, this supports the theory that Bitcoin has been in a bubble over its relatively 

short existence.  

In a different approach, Chan et al (2015) published another study about Bitcoin. 

Their work was based on the statistical analysis of the exchange rate of Bitcoin. Their 

main objective was to provide a formal statistical analysis of the exchange rate of Bitcoin 

versus the USD using a wide range of known parametric distributions in finance. The data 

used was daily Bitcoin Exhange Rate on Bitstamp (Bitcoin versus USD) from the 13th of 

September 2011 to the 8th of May 2014. With this information, it was possible to plot the 

log-returns of the exchange rate of Bitcoin and to estimate its range, mean, skewness, 

kurtosis, standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variance and other statistics. Through 

Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation functions, the authors analysed what 

distribution is better to represent the behaviour of the Bitcoin’s exchange rate to the USD. 

There were considered fifteen of the most popular parametric distributions in finance. The 

distributions were fitted to the selected data and they were compared by their log-

likelihoods and five criteria – the Akaike Information, the Bayesian Information, the 

consistent Akaike Information, the corrected Akaike Information and the Hannan-Quinn 

criterion.  

Overall, the result was that the generalized hyperbolic distribution gives the best fit, 

in opposite to the normal distribution which gives the worst fit. Through the distribution 

that better describes the exchange rate behaviour, the authors predicted the log-returns of 

the exchange-rate based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). 

Their conclusions were that the log-returns will be greater than 2,282×10-1 with 1 percent 

chance and will be less than -2,043×10-1 with 1 percent chance. For 0,1 percent chance, 

values will be greater and less than 4,539×10-1 and -4,108×10-1, respectively.  



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

31 
 

The major lack of this analysis was to not consider the impact of volatility, this is, 

how the past volatility of returns impacts on the current volatility. Actually, one of 

conclusions from the study developed by Baek et al (2015) was that Bitcoins are 26 times 

more volatile than the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index. These authors based their study on Bitcoin daily 

prices ($US) from July 2010 to February 2014, downloaded from www.bitcoinch-

arts.com.  

The article written by Gouriéroux et al (2015) takes this in consideration. The 

authors, similarly to Cheung et al (2015), recognize the presence of local trends and short-

lived episodes of soaring XBT/USD rates, followed by sudden almost vertical declines. 

In this context, the objective of their study was to examine the dynamics of the XBT/USD 

exchange rate and to predict its future evolution. Due to the presence of local explosive 

trends, depicted as bubbles, the XBT/USD exchange rate cannot be modelled by any 

traditional ARIMA or ARCH models (Gouriéroux et al, 2015).  

Then, it was used the mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive process with Cauchy 

errors. They selected 150 observations on the daily closing values of the XBT/USD 

exchange rate over the period 20th February 2013 and 20th July 2013, since that includes 

a bubble, which bursted on April 10, 2013. The series of Bitcoin/USD exchange rates has 

been used as a playground for analysing the relevance of the causal-noncausal modelling 

to capture bubble phenomena, since it was typically an example of highly speculative 

emerging market. Indeed, when they applied the methodology, speculative bubbles 

appeared in that period.  

In conclusion, Gouriéroux et al (2015) mentioned that, given that recently several 

exchange platforms have closed, temporarily or definitely, there is clearly a need of 

supervision to better protect the investors against theft of their Bitcoins, but also against 

the speculative behaviour of large Bitcoin holders. This supervision will likely make 

disappear the previously observed speculative bubbles and perhaps the market for this 

electronic currency itself.  

Nonetheless, if Bitcoin usage grows, then it is expected Bitcoin volatility to drop 

and attract market and economic influence representing a more balanced internally and 

externally driven investments vehicle (Baek et al, 2015).  

On this subject, Urquhart (2016) identified some arguments published, namely by 

Cheah et al (2015) arguing that if Bitcoin were a true unit, account or a form of store of 

value, it would not display such volatility expressed by bubbles and crashes. Dwyer 

(2014) found that the average monthly volatility of Bitcoin is higher than that for gold or 



32 

 

a set of foreign currencies, and the lowest monthly volatilities for Bitcoin are less than 

the highest monthly volatility for gold and currencies. Dyhrberg (2016) showed that 

Bitcoin has similar hedging capabilities as gold and the dollar, and as such can be 

employed for risk management. Still, Cheah et al (2015) developed an econophyscis 

model to reveal that Bitcoin and Ripple (another cryptocurrency) are characterized by 

negative bubbles. 

On the other hand, Urquhart (2016) also stated that the efficient market hypothesis 

(EMH) is one the key cornerstones of finance. A market is efficient if prices fully reflect 

all available information. Three forms of efficiency can be distinguished with the most 

commonly examined form the weak form, where a market is said to be weak form 

efficient if investors cannot use past information to predict future returns.  

Therefore, the author developed a study to test the efficiency of Bitcoin. The study 

was based on data collected from www.bitcoinaverage.com, which is the first aggregated 

Bitcoin price index that aggregates rates from all available Bitcoin exchanges around the 

world and provides a volume weighted average Bitcoin price. The data consisted of daily 

closing prices for Bitcoin in USD from 1st August 2010 to 31st July 2016. Several tests 

were carried out emphasizing: (i) it was examined the autocorrelation of returns, which 

are assessed via the Ljung-Box test; (ii) the runs test (Wald &amp;amp; Wolowitz, 1940) and the 

Bartels test were employed to determine whether returns are independent; (iii) test if 

prices are predictable, employing the variance ratio test (Lo &amp;amp; MacKinlay, 1988); and 

(iv) the BDS test was employed to test the serial dependence in prices returns.  

Summing up, the full sample was split into two subsamples and the results show 

that Bitcoin is an inefficient market over full sample period but appears to becoming less 

inefficient in the second subsample period. The analysis shows that the Bitcoin market is 

not weakly efficient over the full sample period. However, the author shows that Bitcoin 

may becoming more efficient with some of the tests for market efficiency suggesting that 

Bitcoin returns are random in the second subsample. Since it is a relatively new 

investment asset and still in its infancy, it is similar to an emerging market and therefore 

the inefficiency finding is not surprising. Consistent with this argument is that Bitcoin 

will become more efficient over time as more investors analyse and trade Bitcoin. 

 

Carrick (2016) also explored the Bitcoin volatility. The author considered the 

period from 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2015. Through descriptive statistics and 

the correlation matrix, based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, of the major 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

33 
 

currencies and Bitcoin, Carrick performed the comparisons between: (i) Bitcoin relative 

value and volatility to the major currencies of the world; (ii) Bitcoin relative value and 

volatility to commonly traded emerging market currencies; and (iii) Bitcoin returns and 

the returns from an emerging market currency basket electronically exchange traded fund 

(ETF). 

The conclusion was that, with the exception of the CNY, all of the emerging 

currencies are correlated at statistically significant levels. Conversely, it shows that 

Bitcoin is negatively correlated at statistically significant levels with all of the currencies, 

except the CNY. This is an interesting finding as currency risk is a major issue with 

emerging market currencies, but emerging market currencies have become a common 

way to diversify risk and balance both currency portfolios and general investment 

portfolios. Thus, because of the negative correlation of Bitcoin and most of the emerging 

markets currencies, it could fit in well in emerging market currency portfolios to offset 

risk. Although the analysis performed in the present study high-lighted Bitcoin’s 

volatility, Bitcoin can still be a good means of conducting transactions. This is because 

Bitcoins can be instantaneously exchanged into other currencies. Thus, the volatility of 

Bitcoin can almost be eliminated. 

 

One of the most recent studies was published by Balcilar et al (2017) in order to 

address the research gap on the Bitcoin volume-return paradigm. Therefore, the authors 

used a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test, developed by themselves, to examine 

the predictability of Bitcoin returns and volatility based on trading volume. It was 

considered the daily data covering the period of 19th December 2011 to 25th April 2016. 

The test has three main innovations: (i) the approach is robust to misspecification 

errors as it detects the underlying dependence structure across the variables under study; 

(ii) the methodology allows for the detection of not only the causality-in-mean but also 

for any potential causality in the tails of the joint distribution of the variables; and (iii) the 

nonparametric causality-in-quantiles approach allows to examine causality-in-variance 

and, thus, study higher-order dependency. Such an investigation is important because 

during some periods, causality in the conditional-mean may not exist, while, at the same 

time, higher-order interdependencies may turn out to be significant. 

In this study, the authors used two variables, namely, the Bitcoin index and the 

trading volume, as measures of the level of trading activity.  

Thereby, the authors’ main results are summarized as follows: 



34 

 

i) The standard linear Granger causality test, which was conducted for comparison 

purposes, fails to detect any evidence of volume causing returns; 

ii) The nonlinearity test indicates that returns and their relationship with volume 

evolve in a nonlinear manner. Additionally, tests of multiple structural breaks show 

evidence of regime changes in returns and in the equation relating them to volume. 

Evidence of nonlinearity and structural breaks suggests that the linear Granger causality 

is misspecified, thus, leading to unreliable results. 

iii)  The causality-in-quantiles approach, which emerges as a suitable choice given 

evidence of non-linearity, structural breaks, and fat tails, reveals that the null that volume 

does not Granger cause returns is rejected at the conventional levels of significance over 

the quantile range of 0,25 to 0,75 of the conditional distribution of returns. 

However, the authors fail to reject the null that volume does not Granger cause 

volatility over the entire conditional distribution. The results show that volume can 

predict returns, but not volatility, with causality for returns non-existent in bearish (lower 

quantiles) and bullish (upper quantiles) phases.  

To conclude, Balcilar et al (2017) stated that when the market is performing around 

the normal (median) mode, volume can indeed predict returns, by providing investors in 

the Bitcoin market with valuable predictive information. However, when the market is 

behaving well or poorly, all that matters for predicting future returns is past values and so 

information about volume is irrelevant.

3. Data 

As it was mentioned before, one of the main goals of this dissertation is to 

understand how the Bitcoin’s prices are related in the long term with financial and 

economic data and also the physical currencies main drivers of Bitcoin’s prices (XBT), 

relating them with financial and economic data known to have some relationship with 

physical currencies.  

Since the U.S. Dollar is commonly known as the most traded currency in the world, 

the study support base will be the exchange rate XBT/USD [40]. Its daily quotations are 

available in the Bloomberg platform since 1st January 2013 [62], based on the BGNL 

pricing source. Due to this, this will be the first observation date for all the collected data.  

In order to analyse if the Bitcoin quotations have a long term relationship with 

financial and economic data, in this study it will be considered the following variables: 

the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil; the gold price; the 6-

month and 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index. The reasons for 

including these variables in this study are explained below. 

In terms of physical currencies, there are several studies analysing the relations 

between exchange rates, commodities, interest rates and stock prices.  

In terms of commodities, Ameur et al (2016) concluded that there is a negative 

relationship between the U.S. Dollar/Euro returns and oil returns, which means that a U.S. 

Dollar appreciation tend to result in a drop in oil prices. The authors resorted to the price 

per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, whereby this variable will be also 

considered in this study. 

On the other hand, Dyhrberg (2016) performed a GARCH volatility analysis 

between Bitcoin, gold and the Dollar, showing that Bitcoin has many behaviour 

similarities to both gold and the Dollar. So, the gold price will be also considered in this 

dissertation. 

Another variable whose relation with exchange rates has been studied by several 

authors is the yield curve, namely, government bond yields. Bal?i?nas et al (2015) 

developed a research to explain how 2-year and 10-year U.S. and German government 

bond yields can determine the EUR/USD exchange rate in the short run. After estimating 

the linear regression, it was shown that the model can determine 5 per cent of the daily 

EUR/USD fluctuations. It affects the exchange rate as it is stated in the uncovered interest 

rate parity model – when the yield increases, the USD tend to decline against the Euro 

and vice versa. Another finding is that an increase in the German 10-year government 



36 

 

bond yield tend to increase the price of the euro and the increase in the U.S. 10-year debt 

yield leads to an appreciation of the USD. In this sense, it will be collected the 6-month 

and 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields, in order to include a short-term and a long-term interest 

rate.  

Regarding to the relationship between exchange rates and stock prices, Wong 

(2017) developed a study examining the relationship between real exchange rate returns 

and real stock price returns in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Korea, Japan, United 

Kingdom and Germany. The constant conditional correlation or dynamic conditional 

correlation - multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity 

(MGARCH) model showed that real exchange rate return and real stock price return are 

found to be negative and the estimated coefficients are statistically significant for 

Malaysia, Singapore, Korea and the U.K. whereas to be insignificant relationship for the 

Philippines, Japan and Germany.  

Based on these two studies, it will be included the daily quotations of the S&amp;amp;P 500 

Index. 

Resuming, this study will consider the exchange rate XBT/USD and five other 

variables: the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL1:COM); 

the gold price (GC1:COM); the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield (USGG6M); 10-year U.S. 

Treasury Yield (USGG10YR) and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index (SPX:IND). All the prices are 

expressed in U.S. Dollar and the yields in percentages. All data were collected for the 

period between 1st January 2013 and 28th August 2017 and, therefore, the number of 

observations for each time series is 1.701. All the time series observations are graphically 

represented in the appendixes A to F.

4. Methodology under cointegration 

In order to understand if the Bitcoin’s prices are related in the long term with the 

selected variables, it will be performed a cointegration test. Engle &amp;amp; Granger (1987) 

stated that it is frequently of interest to test whether a set of variables are cointegrated, 

because of the econometric implications such as whether some system is in equilibrium 

in the long run. Indeed, the term cointegration was defined by these authors as a 

formulation of the phenomenon that nonstationary processes can have linear 

combinations that are stationary (Johansen, 2014).  

This chapter briefly outlines the econometric specifications and cointegration 

procedures applied to the data mentioned before, starting by the nonstationarity issue.  

 

4.1. Nonstationarity 

According to Tsay (2010), the basis of time series analysis is stationarity. A time 

series {??} is said to be strictly stationary if the joint distribution of (??1 , … , ???) is 

identical to that of (??1+? , … , ???+? ) for all t and ?, where the parameters which 

characterize the distribution of the process depend on the lag ?. This means it requires that 

the joint distribution of (??1 , … , ??? ) is invariant under time shift, what is hard to verify 

because it is defined in terms of the distribution function.  

Consequently, the concept of stationarity defined in terms of the moments is 

commonly preferred. Actually, Tsay (2010) mentioned that the process {?? } is said to be 

weak stationary if the mean and variance of ??  are constant and the covariance between 

??  and ????  are time-invariant, where ? is an arbitrary integer. The weak stationarity is 

also known as second-order, wide-sense or covariance stationary. The same author also 

explained that the weak stationarity implies that the time plot of the data would show the 

T values fluctuating with constant variation around a fixed level, where T is the 

observations number.  

By consequence of the previous definitions, if ??  is strictly stationary and its first 

two moments are finite, then ??  is also weakly stationary. This is why Tsay (2010) 

referred that the second-order stationarity is the most commonly used form of stationarity.  

Indeed, Tsay (2010) stated that, in some studies, interest rates, foreign exchange 

rates or the price series of an asset tend to be nonstationary. For a price series, the 

nonstationarity, also called unit-root nonstationary time series, is mainly due to the fact 

that there is no fixed level for the price.  



38 

 

Before enter into the unit root test, it is important to note that we may be in the 

presence of structural breaks in the time series under analysis in this study. Actually, 

looking to the Chart 1 in the appendix A, it is possible to observe some changes in the 

exchange rate XBT/USD behaviour, namely in the end of 2013, where it seems to occur 

a sharp ‘fast’ increase in the level of the series.  

Perron (2005) developed a study about the interplay between structural change and 

unit root and how to differentiate between them. The author referred that, for example, 

allowing for structural breaks in many financial time series reduces considerably the 

estimates of the long-memory parameters within regimes. The working paper conclusions 

also mentioned that the econometrics and statistics literatures do not provide reliable tools 

to answer to questions such as if the reductions are statistically significant, if they can 

imply the process as being of a short-memory nature within regimes or if there is 

significant evidence of structural changes.  

Although this limitation, it will be performed the Breakpoint Unit Root Test offered 

by the EViews, which allows to test a model for data with a one-time break [23].  

This test consists in a modified augmented Dickey-Fuller test, based in the Perron 

methodology (2005), whose explanation follows.  

The breaks can be characterized as an intercept break, a trend break or a one-time 

break. Like this, the following variables allow us to characterize the breaks, defined in 

terms of a specified break date Tb and where l(.) is an indicator function that takes the 

value one if the argument (.) is true, and zero if not.  

? Intercept break variable – it takes the value zero for all dates prior to the break, 

otherwise one.  

??? (?? ) = ?(? ? ?? )       (1) 

 

? Trend break variable – it takes the value zero for all dates prior to the break and 

it is a break date re-based trend for all subsequent dates. 

???(?? ) = ?(? ? ?? ). (? ? ?? + 1)     (2) 

 

? One-time break dummy variable – it takes the value one on the break date, 

otherwise zero. 

??(?? ) = ?(? = ?? )       (3) 

 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

39 
 

The test considers four different basic models, one for non-trending data and three 

for trending data. Additionally, the EViews offers two versions for each model that differ 

in their treatment of the break dynamics: the innovation outlier model and the additive 

outlier model.  

The Innovational outlier model assumes that the break occurs gradually, with the 

breaks following the same dynamic path as the innovations, while the Additive outlier 

model assumes the breaks occur immediately. Since the break dynamics is not known, 

we performed the tests considering both options, where the conclusions were the same. 

Therefore, we will only present the test output considering the Innovational Outlier 

model. The following equations describe the tests hypothesis, the test equation and the 

four models equations for each trend and break behavior. 

? Null hypothesis 

?? = ???1 + ? + ?(?)(???(?? ) + ????(?? ) + ?? )    (4) 

where ??  are independent and identically distributed innovations and ?(?) is a lag 

polynomial representing the dynamics of the stationary and invertible ARMA error 

process. The break variables enter the model with the same dynamics as the ??  

innovations. 

 

? Alternative hypothesis – It assumes a trend stationary model with breaks in the 

intercept and trend, with the breaks again following the innovation dynamics. 

?? = ? + ?? + ?(?)(????(?? ) + ????(?? ) + ?? )     (5) 

 

? Dickey-Fuller test equation – It nests the null and the alternative hypotheses and 

use the t-statistic for comparing ??? to 1 (????) to evaluate the null. Similarly to the 

conventional Dickey-Fuller unit root test equations, the k lagged differences of the y are 

included in the test equations to eliminate the effect of the error correlation structure on 

the asymptotic distribution of the statistic. The ?, ?, ? and ? are the trend, trend break, 

intercept break and break dummy coefficients, respectively. This equation corresponds to 

the 29th equation presented in the working paper of Perron (2005). 

?? = ? + ?? + ???? (?? ) + ????(?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??
?
?=1   (6) 

 



40 

 

? Model 1: Non-trending data with intercept break – This model sets the trend (?) 

and trend break (?) coefficients to zero, testing a random walk against a stationary model 

with intercept break. 

?? = ? + ???? (?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??
?
?=1    (7) 

 

? Model 2: Trending data with intercept break – This model sets the trend break 

coefficient (?) to zero, testing a random walk with drift against a trend stationary model 

with intercept break. 

?? = ? + ?? + ???? (?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??
?
?=1   (8) 

 

? Model 3: Trending data with intercept break and trend break – This model has no 

restrictions and it tests a random walk with drift against a trend stationary model with 

intercept and trend break. 

?? = ? + ?? + ???? (?? ) + ????(?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??
?
?=1  (6) 

 

? Model 4: Trending data with trend break – This model has no restrictions and it 

tests a random walk with drift against a trend stationary model with intercept and trend 

break. 

?? = ? + ?? + ????(?? ) + ????1 + ? ?? ????? + ??
?
?=1     (9) 

 

In the EViews, when computing the Breakpoint Unit Root Test, we may choose 

between the four trend specifications described by each model. In this section, we will 

select the model with no restrictions (Model 3), corresponding to the Intercept and Trend 

for both Basic and Breaking dropdown menus. Therefore, the test will evaluate the breaks 

in the intercept and trend and we will be able to interpret what breaks are identified 

through the p-value for each one.  

The test also requires to choose the number of lag terms in the Dickey-Fuller 

equations k. The EViews allows us to choose between Akaike Criterion (AIC), Schwarz 

Criterion (SC), Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQC), Modified Akaike, Modified Schwarz, 

Hannan-Quinn, t-statistic, F-statistic and Fixed lag specifications. At this stage we will 

select the Schwarz Criterion (SC) which penalizes more the complex models. Indeed, 

Beal et al (1994) performed a comparison of the Akaike Information Criterion, the 

Schwarz Criterion and the F Test as guides to model selection, concluding that when the 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

41 
 

competing models are very similar or when the design is inadequate, the F test has a 

strong tendency to choose the simpler model, even when the more complex model is 

correct. Additionally, Koehler et al (1988) showed that the Schwarz Criterion is a better 

criterion for applications, when compared to the Akaike Information which leads to 

overparameterisation since AIC will frequently choose higher order models for empirical 

data.  

In the Breakpoint Selection section we need to choose the method for determining 

the breakpoint date. For models with an intercept and trend break, we can decide between 

minimizing the t-statistic for ? in the ADF test (Dickey-Fuller min-t), minimizing the t-

statistic for the intercept break coefficient (Intercept break min-t), maximizing the t-

statistic for the break coefficient (Intercept break max-t), maximizing the absolute value 

of the t-statistic for the intercept break coefficient (Intercept break max-abs-t), or 

providing a specific date (User-specified). In this study, we will select the Dickey-Fuller 

min-t, since it selects the break date providing the most evidence against the null 

hypothesis of a unit root and in favor of the breaking trend alternative hypothesis.  

Although the Eviews allows to compute the test using the raw data (Level) or 

differences of the original data (1st difference or 2nd difference), in this study we will start 

by testing for unit root in “Level” since the proposal is to use the stationarity of the 

original data to cointegrate the variables. Therefore, if all the time series has unit root, we 

need to recompute the test in “1st differences” of the original data to conclude if the all 

the time series are nonstationary and integrated of the same order. If so, we can proceed 

with tests of cointegration. 

All the options selected for the Breakpoint Unit Root Test performed for each 

variable are presented in the appendix G.  

 

4.2. Cointegration and VEC Model 

The proposal of this study is to understand if the Bitcoin’s prices are related in the 

long term with the selected variables. Therefore, it will be performed a cointegration test. 

According to Fabozzi et al (2007), two or more processes are said to be cointegrated 

if they stay close to each other even if they drift as individual processes. In this context, 

the authors stated that the cointegration can be understood in terms of its three key 

features, as follows: 



42 

 

i) Reduction of order of integration: Two or more stochastic processes that are 

integrated of order one or higher are said to be cointegrated if there are linear 

combinations of the processes with a lower order of integration. 

ii) Regression: Two or more processes integrated of order one are said to be 

cointegrated if it is possible to make a meaningful linear regression of one process on the 

other(s). 

iii) Common trends: Given n processes with r cointegrating relationships, it is 

possible to determine n-r common trends. Common trends are integrated processes such 

that any of the n original processes can be expressed as a linear regressions on the 

common trends. 

These processes will be tested through the Johansen Test, based on a Vector 

Autoregressive (VAR) object, which can be computed in the EViews program [63]. 

EViews implemented this VAR-based cointegration test [22] according to the 

methodology developed by Johansen (1991, 1995). According to Johansen et al (1990) 

and Johansen (1991, 1995), both synthetized by Pacheco (2010) and Curto (2013), this 

methodology consists of the following: 

Considering that ?? = (?1? , ?2? , … , ??? )? is a k-vector of nonstationary I(1) 

variables, ??  has been generated by an unrestricted VAR of order p in the level of the 

variables: 

?? = ?1???1 + ?2???2 + ? + ?? ???? + ??? + ?? ,     (10) 

with t = 1, …, T, where ?1, ?2, … , ?? and ? are matrices of coefficients to be 

estimated and ?? is a vector of innovations.  

The VAR system of equations written in error correction form is: 

??? = ? + ?1????1 + ?2????2 + ? + ???1?????+1 + ?????? + ?? ,  (11) 

where ? is the first difference operator and  

?? = ?1 + ?2 + ? + ?? ? ?, for ? = 1, 2, … , ? ? 1, ? = ? ??
?
?=1 ? ?. 

 

Hence, ? is the long run ‘level solution’ for the VAR model. Therefore, if ??  is a 

vector of I(1) variables, the elements ?1????1, ?2 ????2 , … , ???1?????+1 are I(0) and the 

last element is a linear combination of I(1) variables. If the variables are cointegrated, this 

last element must also be I(0). From here, either ??  contains a number of cointegration 

vectors or ? must be a matrix of zeros. The rank of ?, r, determines how many linear 

combinations of ??  are stationary. If r = k, the variables in levels are stationary. If r = 0, 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

43 
 

then ? = 0 and none of the linear combinations are stationary. When 0 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;k, there exists 

r cointegration vectors or r stationary linear combinations of ?? . Here, it is possible to 

factorize ?: ? ? = ???, where both ? and ? are (? × ?) matrices and  ? and ? contain 

the factor loadings and the cointegration vectors, respectively.  

This methodology includes two asymptotically equivalent tests described by 

Johansen (1991, 1995): the Trace test and the Maximum Eigenvalue test. The 

cointegration test is calculated by looking at the rank of the ? matrix through its 

eigenvalues (characteristic roots). The rank of a matrix is equal to the number of its 

eigenvalues that are different from zero. So the eigenvalues (?? ) are sorted in ascending 

order ?1 ? ?2 ? ? ? ??. If the ?’s are roots, then they must be less than one in absolute 

value and positive, and ?1 will be the largest while ?? will be the smallest, that is, the 

closest to one and zero, respectively. If there is no cointegration between the variables, 

the rank of ? will not be significantly different from zero, so ?? ? 0, ??. Actually, the test 

statistics incorporate ln (1 ? ?? ) rather than ?? , however when ?? = 0, ln(1 ? ??) = 0.  

The Trace and the Maximum Eigenvalue tests for cointegration under the Johansen 

approach are the following: 

?????? (?) = ?? ? ln (1 ? ????)
?
?=?+1  and      (12) 

???? (?, ? + 1) = ??ln (1 ? ??+1?) ,      (13) 

where r is the number of cointegrated vectors under the null hypothesis and ???? is the i-th 

ordered eigenvalues estimates from the ?  matrix. Likewise, the larger is the ????, the larger 

and negative will be the ln (1 ? ????) and the larger will be the test value. A significantly 

different from zero eigenvalue directs to a significant cointegrating vector.  

Regarding the distinction between the two tests, the Trace test is a joint test where 

the null is that the number of cointegrating vectors is lower or equal to r against the 

alternative of existence of more than r. It starts with g eigenvalues and, then, successively 

the largest is removed. If all the ?? = 0,  ?????? (?) = 0, for ? = 1, 2, … , ?. 

On the other hand, the Maximum Eigenvalue test conducts separate tests on each 

eigenvalue and its null hypothesis is that the number of cointegrating vectors is r against 

an alternative of ? + 1. 

Moreover, Johansen et al (1990), as referred by Pacheco (2010) also consider that 

the distribution of the test statistics is non-standard and the critical values depend on the 

value of ? ? ?, the number of nonstationary components and whether constants are 

included in each equation. Thereby, if the test statistic if greater than the critical value 



44 

 

from Johansen’s output, reject the null that there are ? + 1 or more than r, for ??????  and 

???? , respectively. The test follows a sequence and under the null, for ? = 0, 1, … , ? ?

1, being the hypothesis for ???? : 

?? : ? = 0, otherwise ?1: 0 &amp;lt;? ? ? 

?? : ? = 1, otherwise ?1: 1 &amp;lt;? ? ? 

?                                                             ? 

?? : ? = ? ? 1, otherwise ?1: ? = ? 

 

The first one tests the existence of no cointegrating vectors, that is, ? having zero 

rank. If the null is not rejected, it will be concluded that there are no cointegrating vectors 

and the test will be completed. However, if it is rejected, the null that there is one 

cointegrating vector (?? : ? = 1) will be tested and so on, increasing the r value until the 

null is no longer rejected. 

If ? is full rank (g) this will correspond to the original series ??  being stationary. If 

? has zero rank, then in the univariate case ???  depends only on ?????, and not on ????? 

(there is no long run relationship between the elements of ???? ). Then, there is no 

cointegration. For 1 &amp;lt;????(?) &amp;lt;?, there are r cointegrating vectors. Therefore, ? is 

defined as the product of the matrices ? and ? of dimension (? × ?) and (? × ?), 

respectively: ? = ???. Here, the matrix ? gives the cointegrating vectors and the matrix 

? the amount of each cointegrating vector for each equation of the VEC Model (equation 

11), also known as the adjustment parameters.  

Additionally, Pacheco (2010) also clarifies that the Vector Error Correction Model 

(VECM) can be interpreted, for example, as a relationship between prices and returns in 

a specified market. That is, the current returns or price changes are a linear function of 

previous returns or price changes and historical prices. This historical prices form a long 

run relationship, where the included variables co-move over time independently of the 

existence of stochastic trends in each of them, meaning that their difference is stable. At 

this stage, the long run residual measure the distance of the system to equilibrium at each 

moment t, which may due to the impossibility of the economic agents to adjust 

instantaneously to new information or to the short run dynamics also present in the data. 

Then, it is important to note that the variables cointegration includes a complex 

adjustment process involving short-run and long-run dynamics.

Considering the previous notes, in order to perform the Johansen Cointegration test 

we need to choose the optimum lag number of VAR representation as well which trend 

assumption to use.  

The optimum lag number of VAR representation was determined using information 

criteria. Similarly to the selection of the number of lag terms in the Dickey-Fuller 

equations (see section 4.1.), we will select to the VAR system lag number based on the 

Schwarz Criterion (SC), which penalizes more the complex models. 

Regarding to the trend assumption considered in the test, since we are not certain 

which trend assumption to use, it is possible to choose the ‘Summary of all 5 trend 

assumptions’ Eviews option. This will indicate the number of cointegrating relations 

under each of the five trend assumptions. To choose between the five trend assumptions, 

we can use the information matrices based on Log Likelihood (LL), Akaike Information 

(AIC) and Schwarz information Criteria (SC). Once again, we will give preference to the 

Schwarz criteria.  

 

4.3. Exogeneity 

Dwivedi (2015) mentioned that economic variables are also classified as 

endogenous and exogenous variables, where an endogenous variable is one whose value 

is determined within the model under analysis while an exogenous variable is determined 

outside the model.  

Pacheco (2010) explained these concepts, exemplifying with two variables ?? and 

?? . Supposing we regress ??  on ??, we say that ?? is weakly exogenous if ??  also does not 

explain ??. On the other hand, ?? is said to be strongly exogenous if current and lagged y 

values do not explain, that is, there is no feedback relationship. Moreover, the author 

defined ?? as super-exogenous if the parameters values in the regression of y on x are 

invariant to changes in the values of x.  

According to Johansen (1992), the weak exogeneity is a relevant condition to apply 

the conditional model for the estimation of the long-run parameters. The concept of weak 

exogeneity was introduced to justify considering some variables as given (exogenous) in 

the analysis of other (endogenous) variables. On the other hand, Ericsson et al (1998) 

stated that the weak exogeneity is the requirement for conditional estimation to be without 

loss of information from conditioning.   

In a different note, Johansen et al (1990) referred that the factor loadings ? contain 

information about exogeneity and, consequently, also about the price leadership. If one 



46 

 

element in the ? vector is zero, the respective price will be weakly exogenous, that is, it 

is determined outside of the system. In this case, if the factor loading parameter in the 

equation for the exchange rate XBT/USD is zero, the data will show that the exchange 

rate is determined outside of the system. 

In order to test the existence of weak exogeneity, following the Johansen (1995) 

methodology, EViews allows us to impose restrictions on the adjustment coefficients, 

based on the (i, j)-th elements of the ? matrix, referred as A(i, j). Furthermore, assuming 

that there is only one cointegration relation in the VEC, to test whether the second 

endogenous variable is weakly exogenous with respect to ?, we should enter the 

restriction: A(2,1) = 0.  

This test will be applied to the variables combinations denoting a long-run 

relationship, based on the Johansen cointegration test. Then, the LR statistic will be 

reported in the EViews output if the degrees of freedom of the asymptotic Chi-Square-

distribution is positive. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (prob. &gt; 0,05 significance 

level), it will be concluded that the endogenous variable i is weakly exogenous with 

respect to the parameters ? (Johansen, 1991). If any of the endogenous variables are 

considered weakly exogenous, it will be analyzed its strong exogeneity through the 

Granger causality.  

According to Ericsson et al (1998), a Granger non-causality is one of the conditions 

required for strong exogeneity, where the Granger causality is defined as the presence of 

feedback from one variable to another. With Granger non-causality there is the absence 

of such feedback. Indeed, these authors mentioned that Granger non-causality is neither 

necessary nor sufficient for weak exogeneity. However, Granger non-causality combined 

with weak exogeneity defines strong exogeneity.  

As detailed by Granger (1969) and synthetized by Pacheco (2010), this 

methodology is based on the following notes. 

In spite of regression analysis deals with the dependence of one variable on other 

variables, it is not a necessary implication of causation. This means that the existence of 

a relationship between variables does not evidence causality or the influence direction. In 

time series regressions, it is also important to take into consideration that time does not 

goes back. This is the basis of the Granger causality test and it means that if even x 

happens before y, then it will be possible that x is causing y but not the contrary.  

Indeed, the Granger (1969) approach to the question of whether x causes y, as 

explained by Curto (2013), is to see how much of the current y can be explained by past 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

47 
 

values of x and then to see whether adding lagged values of x can improved the 

explanation. Then, y is said to be Granger-caused by x if x helps in the prediction of y, 

that is, if the coefficients on the lagged x’s are statistically significant. It is also frequent 

to see a bidirectional relationship, where x Granger causes y and y Granger causes x. 

However, it is important to emphasize that one condition does not imply the other.  

Considering the pair of (x,y) series and the lag length k, corresponding to the 

reasonable longest time over which one of the variables could help to predict the other, 

the bivariate regressions are given as follows: 

?? = ?0 + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ???? + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ???? + ??   (14) 

?? = ?0 + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ?? ?? + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ???? + ??    (15) 

 

Then, the test reported F-statistics are the Wald statistics for the joint hypothesis: 

?0 : ?1 = ?2 = ? = ?? = 0        

for each equation. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that x does not Granger causes y in 

the first regression and that y does not Granger causes x in the second one. 

Summing up, it is possible to distinguish between four causality types: 

i) Unidirectional causality, where x Granger causes y, when the null hypothesis 

is rejected in the first regression and it is not in the second one; 

ii) Unidirectional causality, where y Granger causes x, when the null hypothesis 

is not rejected in the first regression but it is rejected in the second one; 

iii) Bilateral causality, when the null hypothesis is rejected in both regressions, 

meaning that x Granger causes y and y Granger causes x; 

iv) Independence, when the null is not rejected in both regressions, showing that 

where x does not Granger causes y and y does not Granger causes x.

5. Empirical Results 

As mentioned in the section 3., this study will consider the following variables: the 

XBT/USD exchange rate (XBTUSD), the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate 

(WTI) crude oil (CL1:COM); the gold price (GC1:COM); the 6-month U.S. Treasury 

Yield (USGG6M); 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield (USGG10YR) and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index 

(SPX:IND).  

In order to understand if there is some long-term equilibrium between the variables, 

firstly it is necessary to verify if all the time series are nonstationary and if they are 

integrated of the same order. For this purpose, it will be computed the Breakpoint Unit 

Root Test for each variable, considering possible unknown structural breaks.  

Therefore, for the nonstationary time series that are integrated of order one, it will 

be applied the Johansen Cointegration test. Since the purpose of this study is to understand 

if any of the time series presents some long-run relationship with the exchange rate 

XBT/USD, it will be applied the bivariate Johansen cointegration test. This test is 

performed for each two variables system, allowing to analyse those relationships, one by 

one, on a simpler way than the multivariate cointegration. 

 Lastly, if we conclude that the variables are cointegrated, it will be estimated the 

Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) for each cointegration relationship.  

 

All the tests were computed in the EViews program [63] according to the 

methodology and approaches described in the section 4. Note that the EViews program 

replaces all colons (“:”) by underscores (“_”) in the variables names. 

All the conclusions presented in this section, and for statistical inference purposes, 

consider a 5% level of significance.  

 

5.1. Breakpoint Unit Root Tests 

Looking at the graphical representation of the daily quotations of each variable, 

presented in the appendixes A to F, no series shows to remain more or less constant in 

terms of variance and mean. Additionally, there also appears to be changes in the prices 

behavior, namely in the exchange rate XBT/USD where it is possible to observe some 

bitcoin’s value triggers. Therefore, it is important to take into account the possibility of 

structural breaks when testing the stationarity of the series. 

In order to test the stationarity of the daily prices of each variable, from 1st January 

2013 to 28th August 2017, it was computed the Breakpoint Unit Root test in the Eviews

program [23], where the null hypothesis is that the time series has a unit root. As described 

in the section 4.1., the test was computed based on the original data, without no trend 

restrictions (with trend and intercept), considering the innovational outlier model and 

using the Schwarz criterion and the Dickey-Fuller min-t for the lag length and breakpoint 

selections, respectively (see appendix G).  

The Table 1 summarises the Breakpoint Unit Root Test for each variable, based on 

the EViews outputs presented in the appendixes H to M.

Table 1 – Resume of the Breakpoint Unit Root Test outputs presented in the appendixes H to M. 

 

All the tests show to not reject the null hypothesis (Prob. (ADF test) &gt; 0,05 

significance level) and, therefore, we can conclude that the each time series has a unit 

root. For the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index prices, since the null was firstly rejected and its trend break 

was not statistically significant, the test was computed only with intercept. Then, the 

conclusion was that the time series has a unit root. 

For the remaining variable, when recomputed the tests considering only the 

statistically significant coefficients, without (**), in the trend specifications, the 

conclusions were the same. Therefore, those outputs were not included.  

Once all the time series are nonstationary, in order to check if they are integrated of 

order one, we will recompute the Breakpoint Unit Root Test in first differences for each 

variable, that is, using the daily returns instead of the daily prices. Before looking to tests 

results, in the appendixes A to F are also graphically represented the daily returns of each 

time series. Comparing the two charts of each time series, despite the existence of some 

outliers, such as in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields daily returns (see Chart 8), it is 

possible to conclude that the first differences time series tend to remain more constant in 

terms of variance and mean than the original data. Thus, it is expectable that the first 

differences time series tend to be stationary.

Table 2 – Resume of the Breakpoint Unit Root Test outputs presented in the appendixes N to S. 

 

Observing the summary of the Breakpoint Unit Root Tests for the first differences 

of each variable, in the Table 2, it is possible to conclude that all the ADF test results poit 

to reject the null hypothesis (Prob. (ADF test) &amp;lt;0,05 significance level). Therefore, the 

time series have no unit root in first differences and we can conclude they are integrated 

of order one. 

Once again, when recomputed the tests considering only the statistically significant 

coefficients, without (**), in the trend specifications, the conclusions were the same. 

Therefore, those outputs were not included.  

Based on the previous unit root tests, it is possible to conclude that all the variables 

are nonstationary and integrated of order one I(1). So, we can proceed with tests of 

cointegration. 

 

5.2. Cointegration test 

In this section we will perform a bivariate cointegration analysis, that is, we will 

investigate the long-run relationships between the exchange rate XBT/USD and each of 

the other variables considered in this study. Like this, we will test five variables 

combinations, considering the respective five VAR systems.  

Firstly, it is necessary to choose the optimum lag number of VAR representation. 

This selection will be done based on information criteria, specifically based on the 

Schwarz Information Criterion (SC). In order to do not over-parameterize the models, we 

investigated the VAR lag number, for each combination of two variables, until a 

maximum of eight lags.

Table 3 – Resume of the VAR Lag Order Selection Criteria outputs presented in the appendixes T to X. 

 

Based on the Schwarz Information Criteria, it was selected one lag for all the VAR 

representations. The Table 3 shows the optimum lag number of VAR representation, 

based on the Akaike, Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn information criteria.  

After the lag number selection, it is necessary to choose the trend assumption to 

consider in each test, in the Cointegration Equation (CE) and Vector Autoregressive 

(VAR). In this case, we are not certain which trend assumption to consider. Therefore, it 

is possible to compute the Johansen cointegration test with the summary of all five trend 

assumptions, in the EViews program. This option indicates the number of cointegrating 

relations under each trend assumption. The five trend assumptions are the following: 

1) No deterministic trend - No intercept or trend in CE or VAR; 

2) Linear deterministic trend - Intercept (no trend) in CE and no intercept in VAR; 

3) Linear deterministic trend  - Intercept (no trend) in CE and VAR; 

4) Linear deterministic trend  - Intercept and trend in CE and no trend in VAR; 

5) Quadratic deterministic trend - Intercept and trend in CE and trend in VAR. 

 

To choose the trend assumption, we can use information criteria based on Log 

Likelihood (LL), Akaike Information (AIC) and Schwarz information Criteria (SC). As 

mentioned before, we will give preference to the Schwarz criteria. The EViews test shows 

the results by rank and model. 

The Table 4 summarizes the best trend assumption for each variables combination 

based on the Information Criteria detailed in the appendixes Y to AC.

Table 4 – Trend assumption selection based on the Information Criteria presented in the appendixes Y to AC. 

 



52 

 

The Schwarz information Criterion shows that the Model 1, with no deterministic 

trend data and no intercept or trend in CE or VAR, is the best trend assumption for all the 

variables combinations. Excepting for the VAR system of XBTUSD and USGG6M, the 

Model 1 is as good as the Model 2. Then, to simplify, we will consider no deterministic 

trend in all the cointegration tests.  

Summing up, the Johansen Cointegration Test will be performed between the 

exchange rate XBT/USD and each of the other variables, with no deterministic trend. 

 

We will start with the Bivariate Johansen test for cointegration, that is, the 

cointegration between each two variables combination. As mentioned before, the tests 

will be computed for one lag and with no deterministic trend.  

Once again, the results of the Trace and the Maximum Eigenvalue tests are 

presented in the Table 5 and detailed in the appendixes AD to AH.

Table 4 – Bivariate Johansen test for cointegration, according to the outputs presented in the appendixes AD to AH. 

 

Considering the 5% significance level, both Trace and Maximum Eigenvalue 

statistics fail to reject the null of no cointegration in each relationship (r = 0). Then, the 

results point for one cointegration equation for each relationship. Indeed, if it was 

considered the 1% significance level, the conclusion would be the same since all the 

probabilities are 0,0000 &amp;lt;significance level.  

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the cointegration analysis points to a long-

run relationship between the exchange rate XBT/USD and each of the other variables, 

specifically the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the gold 

price, the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield, the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield and the S&amp;amp;P 

500 Index. In other words, this implies that each times series is integrated with the 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

53 
 

exchange rate XBT/USB, where it is possible to estimate the Vector Error Correction 

Model for each one.  

 

5.3. VEC Model Estimation 

According to the previous tests and assumptions, the Vector Error Correction 

Model will be estimated for each bivariate cointegration relationship, considering one lag 

and no deterministic trend.  

The VEC estimates are detailed in the appendixes AI to AM. In order to interpret 

the significance of the coefficients, it is necessary to analyse the t-statistics considering 

the t-statistic critical value of approximately -1,96, for a 5% significance level. The t-

statistics are identified in the EViews outputs [63]. Hence, with 5% of significance level, 

the coefficient is statistically significant if the t-statistic will be lower than -1,96 or higher 

than 1,96.  

Based on these outputs, it is possible to conclude that the estimates for the 

coefficients ? of the long-term relationship equations are not statistically different from 

zero, at 5% significance level, for the relationships between XBTUSD and CL1:COM, 

USGG10YR and SPX:IND, respectively. Based on the bivariate cointegration tests, it 

was expected that there would be some long-run equilibrium between the Bitcoin prices 

and these variables. However, since the coefficients ? are not statistically significant, we 

cannot conclude that there is a long-term relationship between one of these variables and 

the exchange rate XBT/USD. 

In the appendixes AN to AR are presented five graphical representations where it 

is possible to compare the exchange rate XBT/USD historical prices behaviour with each 

of the time series behaviours.  

Starting by the exchange rate XBT/USD and the Crude Price daily prices, the Chart 

13 (see appendix AN) shows that these times series have different behaviours during the 

observation period. While the exchange rate XBT/USD tends to increase with time, the 

Crude price shows a decreasing tendency. Moreover, in periods that XBT/USD keeps 

more constant, namely in the first semester of 2015, the Crude price suffers large 

variations. These are in line with the absence of some long-run equilibrium between the 

Bitcoin and the Crude prices.  

Looking at the Chart 14, the conclusion is not the same. Indeed, until the beginning 

of 2017, both time series do not show huge trend variations, being possible to observe 

small increases and decreases. Additionally, it is possible to observe that the Gold price 



54 

 

tend to decrease, while the Bitcoin price tend to increase, mainly in 2013. This may mean 

that, since there is a cointegration relationship between these variables, possibly the Gold 

price positive variations will promote the Bitcoin prices negative variations, and vice 

versa.  

Regarding the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields, through the Chart 15 in the appendix 

AP, it is possible to see that this time series tends to have the same behaviour that the 

Bitcoin prices, both with an increasing trend during the observation period. This is in 

accordance with the conclusion of the existence of a long-term relationship between these 

variables and it may indicate that positive variations in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields 

will promote the Bitcoin prices positive variations, and vice versa.  

Observing the Chart 16, in the appendix AQ, it is possible to identify some 

similarities with the Crude price. It shows that these times series have different behaviours 

during the observation period, where the exchange rate XBT/USD tends to increase with 

time, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields show a decreasing trend. Moreover, in 

periods that XBT/USD keeps more constant, namely in the first semester of 2015, the 10-

year U.S. Treasury Yields suffer large variations. These are in line with the absence of 

some long-run equilibrium between them. 

Finally, through the Chart 17, presented in the appendix AR, it is possible to 

conclude that the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index prices tend to have a linear increase trend, without deep 

changes or outliers. On the other hand, the Bitcoin prices graphical representation denotes 

changes in behaviour over time, which also points to the inexistence of long-run 

equilibrium between the Bitcoin and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index prices.  

 

For the combinations showing a long-term relationships, the estimated equations 

for XBTUSD are given by: 

???????? = ?0,073039?????????1 + 0,008025(????????1 ? 0,219458??1: ?????1)  

? ???????? = ?0,073039?????????1 + 0,008025????????1 ? 0,00176??1: ?????1  

 

???????? = ?0,068004?????????1 + 0,002365(????????1 + 3.802,169????6???1 )   

? ???????? = ?0,068004?????????1 + 0,002365????????1 + 8,99213????6???1) 

 

These estimations points that on average and in the short term an increase in the 

gold price promotes a decrease in the exchange rate XBT/USD (negative coefficient), 

while the increase in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields promotes an increase in the 



A cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data 

55 
 

exchange rate XBT/USD (positive coefficient). These conclusions were those expected 

from the previous time series graphical analysis.  

However, it is important to note that the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields changes 

tends do not affect the Bitcoin prices on a significant way, since the estimate for the 

coefficient is 0,00176.  

 

5.4. Exogeneity 

Following Johansen (1992, 1995), a weak exogeneity test has been applied to each 

series, testing every element of the adjustment matrix coefficient against zero. Performing 

this test to the variables denoting a relation of cointegration with the exchange rate 

XBT/USD, the outputs are presented in the appendix AS.  

Then, it is possible to conclude that the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity can be 

rejected in the cointegration relationship between XBT/USD and USGG6M (prob. &amp;lt;0,05 

significance level).  

On the other hand, for the relationship between XBT/USD and GC1:COM, the null 

is not rejected (prob. &gt; 0,05 significance level), so the test points to a weak exogeneity. 

This weak exogeneity shows an absence of significant adjustment in the long-term 

relationship of the corresponding VEC Model. Nevertheless, for the GC1:COM remains 

only a short-term relationship with the exchange rate XBT/USD, also implying that its 

prices cannot be used to forecast XBT/USD in the long-run. For this to be also the case 

in the short-run, these prices must be strongly exogenous and hence not affected by the 

short-run movements in XBT/USD. 

Observing the Granger causality test (appendix AT), to check if there were any 

signs of strong exogeneity for the weak exogenous variable, a causal relationship was not 

found for the pair XBT/USD – GC1:COM. Therefore, there is no strong exogeneity of 

GC1:COM and it is possible to conclude that remains a short-term relationship with 

exchange rate XBT/USD.  

 

Summing up, through the study of the dynamic relationships between Bitcoin prices 

and each of the five other variables, the results showed that only the 6-month U.S. 

Treasury Yields present a long-run relationship with the Bitcoin prices, being possible to 

use their rates to forecast the exchange rate XBT/USD in the short term.

6. Conclusion 

The present dissertation “Virtual currency: A cointegration analysis between 

Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data” investigated the existence of dynamic 

relationships between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data. The variables 

selected for this thesis were chosen taking in consideration their relationship with physical 

currencies, already showed on previous studies. The data included the Crude and Gold 

prices, the 6-month and 1-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index prices. 

Bitcoin as a digital currency, emerges in a specific part of the law where there is still 

many legal blanks, as so, it was not expected that instabilities on economic and financial 

data would have the same impacts or relationships as the ones in physical currencies. 

In order to achieve this dissertation’s proposal, it was important to (i) test the 

presence of non-stationarity and first-order integration in each of time series considered 

in this analysis, admitting the existence of structural breaks in the data; (ii) test the 

cointegration between the exchange rate XBT/USD and each of the remaining variables 

under study; (iii) estimate the vector error correction model for the variables cointegrated 

with the Bitcoin prices; and (iv) test the weak exogeneity, which implies the absence of 

significant adjustments in the long-run relationship and, consequently, the preclusion of 

using the model to forecast the Bitcoin prices. 

As the results showed that all the considered time series are non-stationary and 

integrated of order one, all the data was included in the next tests. Therefore, the bivariate 

cointegration Johansen tests pointed to a long-run relationship between the exchange rate 

XBT/USD and each of the other variables, specifically the price per barrel of West Texas 

Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the gold price, the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield, the 10-

year U.S. Treasury Yield and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index quotations. Accordingly, it was 

estimated the Vector Error Correction Model for each one.  

Despite the cointegration results, the estimates for the parameters of the VECM 

model revealed that only the long-term relationships between the exchange rate 

XBT/USD and the gold price and the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield are statistically 

significant. For the other relationships, only the short-term relation has emerged from 

estimation results.  

Additionally, the VEC model estimations pointed that, on average and in the short 

term, an increase in the gold price promotes a decrease in the exchange rate XBT/USD, 

while the increase in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields promotes an increase in the 

exchange rate XBT/USD. However, it is important to note that the 6-month U.S. Treasury

Yields changes tends to not affect the Bitcoin prices on a significant way, since the 

estimate for the coefficient is close to zero. 

Then, considering these two models, it was performed the exogeneity tests, 

concluding that in the gold price system there was an absence of significant adjustment 

in the long-term relationship of the corresponding VEC Model. Nevertheless, for the gold 

price remains only a short-term relationship with the exchange rate XBT/USD, also 

implying that its prices cannot be used to forecast XBT/USD in the long-run. 

Summing up, through the study of the dynamic relationships between Bitcoin prices 

and each of the five other variables, the results showed that only the 6-month U.S. 

Treasury Yields present a long-run relationship with the Bitcoin prices, being possible to 

use their rates to forecast the exchange rate XBT/USD in the short term.  

It should be noted that the current dissertation has limitations that are important to 

consider. Firstly, the variables selection was based on their relationship with physical 

currencies, being possible that they are not the suitable variables to relate with the Bitcoin 

prices and to use to forecast them. On the other hand, the Johansen test assumes that there 

are no structural breaks and the exchange rate XBT/USD behaviour shows multiple 

structural changes. This could be sorted out through structural breaks identification and 

consequent division of the data samples into sub-samples. Lastly, in order to ensure the 

robustness of the model, it should be included additional related variables.
