Abstract 

This dissertation aims to study the effects of changes in the prices of future contracts on 

Brent Crude Oil and US Dollar Index in the price of several agricultural future contract 

prices (Cocoa, Cotton, Coffee, Sugar, Soybean, Wheat and Corn). 

These futures outrights are traded on ICE (Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.) and have a 

remarkable liquidity. Weekly data was used from March 2013 to March 2015 with a 

total of 105 observations.  The prices were collected from the Quandl futures database 

and are settlement prices from the front outrights. The Back-Adjusted method was 

chosen to perform the roll over. 

We started by studying the correlation between US Dollar Index and Brent Crude Oil 

prices. Confirming the conclusions of other studies, we found a negative correlation 

between the prices of Brent Crude Oil and the US Dollar Index. The Granger Causality 

test gave us enough statistical evidence to conclude that a variation in Brent Crude Oil 

prices indeed cause an impact on the US Dollar Index. 

By applying Johansen`s cointegration test we indeed found cointegrating vectors 

between Brent Crude Oil, the US Dollar Index and each one of the studied agricultural 

commodities. The next step was to build vector error correction models. Although some 

of them proved not to be rock solid, we manage to establish a link among the variables, 

namely in the case of Soybean, which produce remarkable results and may, in fact, be 

treated as a benchmark for traders of future contracts. 

Keywords: Cointegration, Future Contracts, agricultural commodities, Brent Crude Oil, 

US Dollar Index

1.Introduction 

Trading is believed to have taken place throughout much of the recorded history of 

human kind and it is an important asset of our economy. Speculation played a key role 

in the development of financial markets and trading platforms.  

From stocks to bonds, futures and options nowadays it is possible to trade hundreds of 

thousands of different financial products. With the flourishing of organized clearing 

houses and the generalization of electronic trading the financial markets have now more 

liquidity than ever and are at every person´s reach. 

Having this context as starting point, this dissertation aims to test the presence of 

cointegrating relations between the prices of future contracts in Brent Crude Oil, US 

Dollar Index and agricultural commodities.  

Exchange rates are known for their direct impact on the export and import of goods and 

services and, thus, are expected to influence the price of these trading commodities.  

At the same time, the use of chemical and petroleum derived inputs has increased in 

agriculture over time. It is therefore expected that energy, namely the price of Crude 

Oil, to have an important impact in commodity production. 

Working as a futures trader for OSTC Portugal, I find this topic deeply interesting and 

useful both in theoretical and practical framework.  

The number of future contracts traded on exchanges worldwide is increasing every year 

and dozens of millions of contracts change hands every trading day.

According to FIA (Futures Industry Association), more than 12,1 billion future 

contracts were traded worldwide in 2014 alone. Agricultural commodities have also 

being flourishing in 2014, showing a volume increase of more than 15% from 

approximately 1,2 billion contracts traded in 2013 to 1,4 billion in 2014. 

Many prior studies were conducted to test these relations between Crude Oil prices and 

agricultural commodities prices (Nazlioglu (2012)), between the US Dollar strength and 

agricultural commodities prices (Abbot et al. (2008)) and between the three variables 

(Harri et al (2009)) over a significantly long period of time using weekly or monthly 

data. 

Trading future contracts is a highly leveraged investment. The initial margin required to 

enter into a new futures contract is usually lower than 10% of the futures contract. 

This may bring a big profit (or loss) to an investor for a small market movement. In fact, 

many futures traders enter in a position to make 1 or 2 ticks (minimum amount prices of 

future contracts can move).   

Therefore, this study will focus on a short-run analysis with weekly observations, which 

may lead to novel conclusions and serve as a benchmark for practical purposes.

2. Literature Review 

Is there any relationship between exchange rates and Crude Oil prices and commodities 

prices? This subject has been studied by different authors in the last years. The purpose 

of their studies is mainly related to a practical need: to find a comprehensive model that 

explains past prices and predicts future prices of those commodities.  

In fact, the fluctuation of Crude Oil prices ( by far the most traded commodity) and the 

volatility of some agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soybean, for example) and 

also the exchange rate (mainly the US Dollar exchange rate, in comparison with other 

currencies, euro, yen, Australian dollar)  tend to be correlated. How do they influence 

each other?   

Novotni (2012) studied the relationship between the nominal effective exchange rate of 

the US Dollar and the Brent Crude Oil price, examining monthly data from January 

1982 to September 2010. He modeled the Brent Crude Oil price as a function of some 

explanatory variables: nominal effective exchange rate of US Dollar, the industrial 

production of the OCDE countries and oil inventories of United States. He concluded 

that, in the period between 2005 and 2010, Brent Crude Oil price and the exchange rate 

were related in an inverse way: decreasing the nominal effective exchange rate of the 

Dollar of 1% implies an increase in the Brent Crude Oil price of 2,1%. Before 2005 the 

correlation between those two variables was very weak or even inexistent. 

One explanation for the inverse relation between Brent Crude Oil price and the effective 

exchange rate of the US Dollar may be the fact that commodities are traded in US 

Dollar, so depreciation in US Dollar implies the compensatory rise of the commodities 

price.

Natalenov et al (2013) studied the relationship between Crude Oil, corn and ethanol 

during a particularly turbulent period between 2006 and the end of 2011. 

Their first conclusion was that, considering the whole period of time, there was no 

correlation between these three variables. Then the period of time was divided in two 

sub periods, the first from March 2005 to July 2008, and the second period of time from 

August 2008 to the end of 2011. At the same time, they decided to look for a bi-variate 

relation between two variables, instead of looking for cointegrated relations between the 

prices of the three mentioned commodities. 

They came to the conclusion that, between 2008 and 2011, the Brent Crude Oil price 

and corn, and the Brent Crude Oil price and ethanol, were linearly related, with changes 

of the Brent Crude Oil price implying changes, with the same signal but with different 

amplitude, on the corn and the ethanol prices. 

Natalenov referred to some factors that may have contributed to the complex relation 

between those three commodities prices: The Energy Policy Act of 2005, Crude Oil 

price level surpassing the threshold of 75 USD/barrel and the 2008 financial crises.  

Nazlioglu (2012) analysed the price transmission from the world oil prices to the key 

agricultural commodity prices by employing weekly data from 1994 to 2010. Using 

Granger causality test, Nazlioglu found empirical evidence of a nonlinear causal linkage 

between Oil and the agricultural commodity prices for corn, soybean and wheat. 

Another study on this topic was put forth by Campiche et al. (2007). This research 

examined the co-variability between Crude Oil prices and corn, sugar, sorghum, 

soybeans, soybeans oil and palm oil prices during the period 2003-2007. Johansen 

cointegration tests revealed no cointegrating relationships during 2003-2005, but a

positive cointegration of corn prices and soybean prices with oil prices during the 2006-

2007 time periods. 

Abbot et al. (2008) highlights the strong and important link between the US Dollar 

Index and commodity prices.  Most commodities are priced in US Dollars, but are 

purchased in the local currency. When the dollar strength falls there is a link with rising 

commodity prices. 

A similar approach is used by Murphy (1999). By graphically illustrating a similar path 

between gold prices and the US Dollar Index from April 1995 to October 1996, it states 

that a rising Dollar normally has a depressing effect on most commodity prices. 

Harri et al (2009) studied the relationship between the exchange rate (measured as a 

trade weight average of the US dollar value against other major currencies), Crude Oil 

price and some other commodities (mainly corn, cotton and soybeans) prices. By using 

overlapping time periods taken from monthly data, between January 2000 and 

September 2008, they found a cointegration relationship: oil prices are linked to corn, 

cotton and soybeans, but not to wheat. 

They also found that the exchange rates, crude oil and corn prices are correlated, and 

that exchange rates influence the linkage of the commodities prices over time. 

Rosa et al (2012) have studied the relationship between some agricultural commodities 

and crude oil prices, trying to test the hypothesis that the increased volatility in 

agricultural prices is caused by the exogenous crude oil prices. They used data between 

January 1999 and May 2012, and this study compared the prices of corn, wheat and 

soybean (whose choice is justified because they are the most traded agricultural 

commodities used on feedstock, food and fuel) with the crude oil price.

The authors concluded for a strong non-linear linkage between crude oil and corn 

prices, explained by the increased use of corn in the production of ethanol. The 

volatility of the crude oil price causes some volatility on corn and soybean prices, too, 

because of their energy and industrial use. The case of wheat prices is different: an 

increase in consumption leads to the decrease in wheat stocks, which is responsible for 

the large increase in wheat prices, during that period of time. 

Zhang (2013) used Granger causality test to test the hypothesis that changes on the price 

of crude oil causes the change in the US dollar exchange rate, and not vice-versa. Golub 

(2013) explains that effect saying that when the oil price rises, it increases the income of 

oil exporting countries and those countries use the higher income to purchase more US 

dollars, which causes its appreciation. Using monthly data between January 2003 and 

June 2010, Zhang finds no evidence of significant cointegration between the two 

mentioned variables, but that evidence appears when allowing for two structural breaks 

in the past: November 1986 and February 2005 (these two dates are related with 

important changes in the oil market). He finally concludes that there is a stable 

relationship between the price of Crude Oil and the value of the US dollar exchange 

rate, but that relationship has been subject to structural breaks over time.

3. The Data 

The data used in this study is the Quandl Future prices database and comprises of 

weekly data (Tuesday) from the first trading Tuesday of March 2013 until the first 

trading Tuesday of March 2015 with a total of 105 observations per product. 

The variables used are futures in Brent Crude Oil, US Dollar Index, Corn, Soybean, 

Wheat, Cocoa, Coffee C, Cotton and Sugar No.11.  

The US Dollar Index is a measure of the value of the US Dollar relative to a basket of 

foreign currencies. It is calculated as a weighted geometric mean of Dollar´s value 

against Euro, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and 

Swiss Franc. In the future markets, one contract is traded as 1000$ x Index Value. 

All the prices collected are settlement prices, which is a trade weighted average of the 

number of lots traded at each price over a certain period of time, shortly before the close 

of the market. This price is used to determine the profit or loss for the day in order to 

update margin requirements. 

All these future prices are from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a leading network 

of exchanges and clearing houses for financial and commodity markets, which operates 

completely as an electronic exchange. 

One important aspect that we face when dealing with future contracts is the expiring 

nature of the product.  

Futures are not continuous contracts such as stocks. Each specific contract has a starting 

trading day and an expiring day.  For this reason, it is essential to use a roll method 



João Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis 
______________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 

8 
 

between contracts to create a continuous future contract which can later be used for 

back testing. 

Stringing subsequent price series together creates a discontinuous time series since the 

expiring of a contract and the passage to the next front-month may carry significant 

price gaps. 

Therefore, the roll method used in this study is the Back-Adjusted method. The gap 

between two contracts is measured, and then added or subtracted to all values in the 

prior contracts. 

This method is one of the most commonly used for this purpose, being also used by 

CQG Trader, a leading high-performance market data and electronic trading application 

used by future traders worldwide. 

This work has been made of attempts and reformulations depending on the results and 

difficulties, which were found throughout the process. However, it was carried out the 

usual approach in this type of work: the sources and the data to be used were selected; 

the next step was to verify whether the data presented some kind of correlation (a look 

on the plot of the data is useful to this purpose) and run some tests concerning that 

correlation. The third step was to find a model that could express the evolution in time 

of the variables which were to be studied in order to fit the purpose of this analysis: try 

to understand in what sense agricultural commodities prices are related with the 

exchange rate and the Brent Crude Oil price. 

The statistical software used to conduct this research was EViews. We´ve choose 

EViews because it is commonly used in statistical works and provides all kind of tests, 

models and tools that should be necessary.

4. Methodology 

This section discusses theoretical principles used in this work. 

4.1. Stationary and non-stationary time series 

Gujarati (2011) refers that “a time series is said to be stationary if its mean and variance are 

constant over time and the value of the covariance between the two periods depends only on 

the distance or gap or lag between the two time periods and not the actual time at which the 

covariance is computed” . However, many time series, more exactly typically financial time 

series, often display some kind of systematic upward or downward movement through time 

and, as a consequence, are not stationary.  

Stationary and non-stationary time series demand different approaches, otherwise forecast 

studies will predict, most probably, inconsistent conclusions and unrealistic or divergent 

results. A time series with a trend is one of the most usual examples of non-stationary time 

series. 

Figure 1 illustrates a stationary and a non-stationary time series.  

 

 

 

 

FIGURE 1: stationary time series and non-stationary time series, respectively  

(Asteriou, 2007)

If the series has a deterministic long-run trend it may be possible to transform it into 

stationarity, by considering the deviations from the trend. If the trend is stochastic, 

transformation into stationarity requires first-differencing. 

Only rarely is differencing more than once necessary to obtain stationary time series. 

 

4.2. Augmented Dickey-Fuller  (ADF) test  

To test the stationarity of a time series we usually use the reference test or the Augmented 

Dickey-Fuller test.  

Dickey and Fuller proposed three alternative regression equations, based on a simple AR(1) 

model, that can be used for testing for the presence of unit root as synonymous of non-

stationarity.  

These equations are:                                ttt uyy ??? ?1?                      (1) 

                                                                 ttt uyy ???? ?1??                (2) 

                                                                 ttt uyty ????? ?1???          (3)  

Where (3) includes a time trend and a constant and (2) only includes a constant. 

DF test is a t-test, but not a conventional one, so we must use non standard critical values 

which were first calculated by Dickey and Fuller, and later by other authors. 

Dickey and Fuller extended their test procedure including extra lagged terms of the 

dependent variable. This allows for the testing of unit roots in autoregressive processes that 

are of order higher than one, 



João Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis 
______________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 

11 
 

The three possible equations of the test are the same but now they all include the additional 

term ? ? ??
p

i iti
y

1
.? . So we have the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, with the null hypotheses 

defined as Ho: there is a unit root. 

This test may be used with all the variables and, when non-stationarity is observed, it may 

be used again to test their first differences, second differences, and so on. 

We say that a variable is integrated of order 1, or simply )1(I  when the series is non-

stationary in level but his first differences are stationary. 

 

4.3. Cointegration 

If we have two or more non-stationary time series, that become stationary when differenced, 

such that some linear combination of those series is stationary, then we say that they are 

cointegrated. That means that those series show some kind of long-run relationship. 

In other words, we say that two )1(I  time series tx  and ty  are cointegrated, if there is a ?  

such that ttt xyz .???  is stationary. 

Figure 2 illustrates the situation: tx  and ty  are non-stationary, but in long-run they are 

moving together. So we may find a relation between those two series, and define a third one 

which is stationary.

FIGURE 2: Example of cointegrated time series,  Bação (2000) 

In this example, if we suppose that 
t

z  is approached by
tt

yx .2? , for instance, then )2,1( ?  

will be a cointegrating vector between the variables 
t

x  and
t

y . More generally, the 

cointegrating vector is a )2,( kk ?  vector ( )0?k .  

4.4. Johansen test 

To test the existence of cointegration between the variables, we may use, at least, one of 

three kind of tests: the Engle-Granger cointegration test developed by Engle and Granger 

(1987), the Philips-Ouliaris reference test, presented by these authors, or most recently the 

Johansen cointegration test, presented by Johansen and Juselius in 1990. 

The main advantage of the Johansen test, regarding the others tests, consists in the 

determination of the number of cointegrating vectors that exists among the studied variables, 

when these variables are cointegrated, and provides estimates of all cointegrating vectors. 

As Dwyer (2014) refers, the Johansen test can be seen as a multivariate generalization of the 

ADF test because it is the study of linear combination of variables for unit roots. It must be 

noticed that if there are n  variables, each with unit roots, there are 1?n  possible co-



João Figueiredo                                                Drivers of Agricultural Future Commodity Prices: a Cointegration Analysis 
______________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 

13 
 

integrating vectors, and if there are n variables and n  cointegrating vectors, then we may 

conclude that the variables do not have unit roots.  

Johansen proposes two different tests: the trace test and the 
max

? test.  

The trace test is based on the log-likelihood ratio )](/)(ln[
maxmax

kLrL  and is conducted 

sequentially for 0,1,...,1?? kr . This test tests the null hypothesis that the cointegration rank 

is equal to r against the alternative hypothesis that the cointegration rank is equal to k . 

Asteriou (2007) refers four steps in Johansen test approach: step 1: test the order of 

integration of all variables; step 2: set the appropriate lag length of the model. This may be 

done using some criteria that we will see next; step 3: choose the appropriate model that 

correlates the variables; step 4: determine the rank of ?   or the number of cointegrating 

vectors, using max? test or trace test. 

  

4.5. Granger causality test. 

We may test the possibility of statistical precedence between them: which one causes the 

other one movement? We may test it in both directions, using the Granger causality test.  

Given two sets of time series data, tx  and ty , we may create two models to test which of 

them better fits to predict ty : one model only with past values of ty  and the other model 

with past values of ty and tx .  

The residual sum of squares errors is compared and a test is used to determine which model 

is more adequate to explain the future values of ty . The null hypothesis is: H0:  ?i = 0 for

each i, with 
i

?  the coefficient of the variable
t

x , in the model, against Ha: ?i ? 0 for at least 

one of the 
i

?  coefficients. We may execute this test using different values of lags. 

 

4.6. Akaike Information Criterion 

We must compare the goodness of fit data-models, to decide the number of lags must be 

used in the model. We may use some criteria provided by R or EViews software, for 

instance: the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Finite Prediction Error (FPE), the 

Schwarz Baysean Criterion (SBC) and the Hannan and Quin Criterion (HQC).  

Ideally the chosen model should be the one which minimizes all these criteria. However, 

sometimes the results are contradictory, and in the analysis of time series the statistic most 

commonly used is AIC. It is defined by: 

                                                           n

 and tû   represents the difference between the actual

 4.7. VAR (Vector Autoregressive) model, VEC (Vector Error Correction) model  

We may model a time series data using some models. The simplest one is the autoregressive 

of order one model AR(1), which is given by:         

                                          ttt uyy ?? ?1.?                                     (5)

Where ?&amp;lt;1 and 
t

u is a Gaussian error term. This model assumes that the actual value of 

t
y  is determined by its own value in the precedent period. 

The model becomes more complex when we have more than one time series, with the actual 

values of each one influenced not only by its own past values, but also by the past values of 

all the others variables. In this case we can use a VAR model. 

Pfaff (2006) defines a Vector Autoregressive model as a set of k endogenous variables 

written in the form:  

uptptt
uyAyAy ????

??
...

11
.                           (6) 

In this equation, 
i

A  is the ( kk ? ) matrix of coefficients and tu  is a k-dimensional lagged 

process of order p, with 0)( ?tuE . 

More clearly, considering two variables, we may write it in the following way: 

?? ? ?? ? ????
p

?? ? ?? ? ????

        (8) 

where we assume that tu1  and tu 2  are uncorrelated white-noise error terms, called impulses or 

shocks.  

In this form we may see that ty   and tx   are affected not only by their past values, but each 

variable is affected, too, by the other variable past and current values. 

Although the number of lagged values of each variable can be different, we usually use the 

same number (p) of lagged terms in each equation

A VAR model can be reformulated as an error correction model considering the following 

relation:

on the existence of intercept and trend in CE or in VAR; the model with trend in CE and in 

VAR is only theoretical (non realistic) so, in practice, it is rarely adopted. 

In VECM model, the rank (or trace) of matrix 
'

? has the following lecture, concerning with the 

cointegration of the variables: if 0?r  there is no cointegration (we can’t use VECM, only 

VAR in first differences); if kr ??0  there are r cointegrating vectors (we can use VECM); if 

kr ?  all the variables are already stationary, so we may use VAR on level data.

5. Empirical results 

A regard over the plot of the time series data may pronounce the existence of temporal 

correlation amongst the variables (Figure 10). Some of them are expected to be 

correlated (Corn and Brent, for instance, according to some literature) but the nature of 

this study, mainly focused on short-run prices, may produce unexpected results.  

Figure 3 shows the plot of Brent Crude Oil and the US Dollar Index during the studied 

period. It is not clear the existence of cointegration; in fact, cointegration, seen as a 

long-run relationship, may not be seen in a two years time period, with weekly 

observations. 

 

FIGURE 3: Plot of Brent Crude oil and US Dollar Index. 

 

As it was mentioned before, it is necessary a preliminary study of stationarity of the 

variables. This study may begin by the observation of the plot of the time series and, 

next, by the application of the ADF test. To run this test we may begin fitting a model, 

chosen among the three options (none, intercept or trend) and a regard over the plot may 

be an important step. In order to avoid spurious regression problem, we will begin

Comparing the values obtained, in Table II and III, with the critical values, in Table I, it 

is easy to conclude that all the variables are non stationary in level, at a statistical 

significance level of 5%, which is the usually adopted level. This is a no surprising 

result, after the regard of the plots of the studied variables. Figure 3 reveals the 

beginning of a particular turbulence period in the US Dollar Index and in Brent Crude 

Oil prices (October 2014- March 2015) and most of the agricultural commodities suffer 

the consequences of such volatility.  

Next, the same test was run to the first differences of all the variables. In this case it was 

not necessary to test with the three models, because all the plots showed the values 

distributed more or less along the zero line, as we can see in Figure 4, with the graph of 

the Brent Crude Oil first differences.

FIGURE 4: Graph of ? Brent (Brent Crude Oil first differences) 

 

In the case of the ADF test applied to the first differences, all coefficients are 

statistically significant at a 1% or lower level, which means that all the variables are 

integrated of order one: )1(I . 

Following the purpose of this study, next we will see if there is evidence of correlation 

in time among some variables. First we will test for correlation between Brent Crude 

Oil prices and the US Dollar Index as some previous studies (mentioned in the literature 

review) have done, in a larger temporal window. Then it will be studied the 

relationships among the US Dollar Index, Brent Crude Oil prices and each one of the 

agricultural commodities.

5.1. Relationship between Brent Crude Oil prices and the US Dollar Index 

We can determine if Brent Crude Oil prices and the US Dollar Index are cointegrated 

using Johansen cointegration tests. Both tests (trace test and maximum eigenvalue test) 

reveal the presence of one cointegrating vector which describes the long run relationship 

between the two variables. The test output is in Table IV.

Granger causality test was used to study the relationship between Brent Crude Oil prices 

and the US Dollar Index, with the optimal number of lags equal to 5 (Table XII). Table 

V shows that, in the period of time between March 2013 and March 2015, a change in 

Brent Crude Oil price indeed causes an impact in the US Dollar Index, but not the vice-

versa.

Now it will be used the Vector Error Correction Model. Asteriou (2007) refers some 

reasons why this is a very useful model: it measures the correction from disequilibrium 

of the previous period, which has a very good economic implication; it is formulated in 

first differences which typically eliminate trends from the variables involved and 

resolves the problem of spurious regression; the disequilibrium error term is a stationary 

variable, so there is some adjustment process which prevents the errors in the long-run 

relationship becoming larger and larger. 

There are five different models, depending on the existence of intercept or trend in VAR 

and also the existence of intercept or trend (linear or quadratic) in the cointegrating 

equation. Software EViews provide us with the information of the best model to use 

(Table XIII). We use the same lag length previously determined. The result is displayed 

on Table VI.

equation:       OilCrudeBrentIndexUSDollar __213789,07981,106_ ???                    

We can conclude that the error correction term (-0.347140), which describes the speed 

of adjustment to equilibrium, is highly significant. 

The model is based in the assumption that residuals follow a white noise process or, in 

other words, we need to check if the residuals are normally distributed, with zero mean, 

with no serial correlation, and show no arch effect.

statistical evidence that the residuals follow a normal distribution.

5.2. Relationship between Brent Crude Oil price, the US Dollar Index and 

agricultural commodities prices 

Do Brent Crude Oil prices, US Dollar Index and the price of agricultural commodities 

go together in the long-run or, in other words, do they reveal a long-term relationship, in 

spite of its non-stationary behavior in level? To ask this question we run the Johansen 

test, using, each time, one of the agricultural commodities with the pair Brent Crude 

Oil-US Dollar Index.  

Johansen’ tests for cointegration were preceded by the determination of the optimal lag 

length and the optimal model to use, chosen among the five models of VECM. The 

results of the Johansen’s trace test for cointegration are reported in Table VIII and the 

complete results of trace tests are in Tables XV to XXI.

*Critical Values 

 

In all cases, the trace statistic indicates a cointegration rank of r = 1, given a 5% 

significance level. So we can conclude that there is one cointegrating vector between 

Brent Crude Oil price, US Dollar Index and each one of the other commodities, which 

reflects the long-run relationship among those three variables.  

The next step is to create VEC models which allow us to quantify the short and long-run 

correlations. Lag 2 was determined by Akaike Information Criteria as being the optimal 

lag length to use in all the models.  ?Commodity 1?t and ?Commodity 2?t represent lag 1 

and lag 2 of the dependent variable, respectively.

Some conclusions can be taken about the significance of the model: 

All coefficients of ?wheat and ?cotton model are not statistically significant at a 10% 

level. Therefore, both models must be read with extremely caution.

In ?cocoa, ?corn, ?soybean and ?sugar models, the adjustment coefficient alpha (
^

? ) is 

significant at a 5% or lower level. The higher values of that coefficient in ?Cocoa, 

?sugar and ?soybean reflects a higher speed of adjustment to equilibrium than in 

?Corn. ?Soybean is the model with the most statistically significant coefficients.  

As it was previously referred, this model is based in the assumption that residuals 

follow a white noise process. So we need to check if the residuals are normally 

distributed, with zero mean, with no serial correlation, and show no arch effect.

According to the tests, we can’t reject the null hypotheses that ?Corn and ?Coffee 

models exhibit heterokedasticity in residuals for a 5% significance level. ?Corn fails too 

in LM test and Jarque-Bera test, so we can’t reject the null hypotheses of a non normal 

distribution of the residuals and the existence of no serial correlation. ?Coffee fails too 

in Jarque-Bera test. According to the results contained in Tables X and XI, we pursuit 

with the study of Soybean, Cocoa and Sugar models as being the best fitted models 

obtained in this study. 

The relatively low values of R squared were already expected due to the small number 

of the explanatory variables. We may not forget that we are dealing with futures prices 

on agricultural commodities, which are highly dependent on weather conditions. 

Natural disasters or periods of dry in the main export countries causes extremely 

volatility in prices which are not a direct cause of changes in the Brent Crude Oil prices 

and the US Dollar Index. 

Figures 7, 8 and 9 show respectively the impulse response of Soybean, Cocoa and Sugar 

to a one unit shock in US Dollar Index and Brent Crude Oil prices.

FIGURE 9: Response of Sugar prices to a shock in US Dollar Index and in Brent

We verify that Sugar and Soybean respond positively to an increase of one unit in US 

Dollar Index and sugar tends to decrease its price. The response of Soybean to a unit 

shock in US Dollar Index has two distinguished periods: first Soybean price increases 

and then (around period t+5) decreases to lower values than the pre-shock level. In the 

other hand, Sugar remains relatively stable to a unit shock in Brent Crude Oil price.

6. Summary and conclusions 

With the recent unusual volatility in the prices of some agricultural commodities and the 

Brent Crude Oil plumbing being often blamed for that, this dissertation aimed to test the 

strength of this correlation and to what extent speculators can use it as a benchmark. 

The dollar strength, being quantified as the US Dollar Index, was also used as an 

independent variable highlighting the possible direct impact that Forex markets can 

cause to these variables which are all quoted in US Dollars on ICE (Intercontinental 

Exchange, inc.).  

First, we started by studying the correlation between the Brent Crude Oil prices and the 

US Dollar Index. We found a cointegrating vector between these two variables (which 

revealed the inverse relationship between them) and, applying the Granger Causality 

test, we found that a change in Brent Crude Oil prices causes a change in US Dollar 

Index.  

A regard over the plot of both time series also highlights this relationship. The recent 

plunge of Brent Crude Oil prices due to Iran´s increasingly oil production after having 

its sanctions lifted, and the slowdown of China´s manufacturing were followed by an 

enormous spike in the US Dollar Index. 

The next step was to study the cointegrating relations between Brent Crude Oil prices, 

the US Dollar Index and each one of the selected agricultural commodities. 

Through the application of the ADF and Johansen trace tests we concluded that all 

variables are stationary of order one and there is one cointegrating vector between all 

the three variables. 

Next, we built vector error correction models and conducted its analysis and the study 

of residuals.

Low statistical significance was found for all coefficients of Wheat and Cotton. A 

feature which may indicate the low dependence of petroleum based inputs in these crops 

and a stable demand and supply of these commodities independently of Forex markets. 

For Cocoa, Soybean, Sugar and Corn we have statistically significant coefficients of 

adjustment (alpha). The low value of alpha for Corn indicates a slow retrace of this 

commodity to equilibrium after a shock. The ARCH test made for this variable also 

indicates that we can´t reject the hypothesis of heteroskedasticity in its residuals for a 

5% significance level.  

The Soybean model was the one with the most statistically significant coefficients. A 

feature certainly related with the increasingly use of Soybean in the production of 

biofuel. 

On the other hand, one of the most unexpected conclusions of this dissertation was the 

lack of correlation between Corn prices and the prices of Brent Crude Oil. 

The use of Corn for the production of ethanol, which can be used as a substitute for both 

crude oil and gasoline, would expectedly create a link between these variables as 

pointed out by Natalenov et al (2013). 

Nevertheless, this type of research must be carefully interpreted, since correlations 

might appear in different periods of time as was already proven by different studies. 

One thing we can be sure: Brent Crude Oil and the strength of the US Dollar do play a 

role in the price variation of agricultural commodities which should not be forgotten by 

both, speculators and agricultural companies who wish to hedge their exposure.
