Resumo 

Desde a sua descoberta e exploração que o petróleo se tornou na força motriz da 

economia mundial e o principal sustento da sociedade moderna, afetando o quotidiano 

de centenas de milhões de pessoas em todo o Mundo.  

Contudo, várias previsões por parte de diversas agências alertam para o esgotamento 

das suas reservas num futuro próximo pois, uma vez que se tratam de um recurso não-

renovável, estas existem em quantidades finitas e não conseguem satisfazer o nível de 

procura atual porque a sua formação natural à escala humana é tão lenta que as 

reservas existentes simplesmente são incapazes de aumentar ou ser reabastecidas 

mais rapidamente do que a taxa a que são extraídas atualmente.  

Além da disponibilidade, existe também o problema do impacto ambiental da exploração 

e combustão de combustíveis fósseis, principalmente as emissões de CO2 para a 

atmosfera que estão estreitamente relacionadas com a poluição e as alterações 

climáticas. 

Devido a todos os motivos supramencionados, é urgente encontrar substitutos que 

satisfaçam as necessidades energéticas mundiais. Entre as diferentes alternativas 

energéticas existentes, os biocombustíveis representam a opção mais favorável ao 

meio ambiente.  

Os biocombustíveis podem ser classificados como primários ou secundários. Os 

primários utilizam material orgânico que é queimado diretamente na sua forma química 

natural e não modificada, utilizado principalmente para o aquecimento e a produção de 

eletricidade. Os secundários utilizam a biomassa processada que existe na forma 

sólida, gasosa ou líquida e podem ser usados para o transporte e em vários processos 

industriais. Os biocombustíveis secundários são ainda classificados como 

biocombustíveis de primeira, segunda e terceira geração. 

Os biocombustíveis de primeira geração são produtos derivados de culturas alimentares 

para consumo humano. No entanto, a utilização de terras agrícolas aráveis para a sua 

produção gera alguma polémica, levando a que muitas agências, particularmente 

organizações agrícolas e alimentares assim como modeladores económicos 

questionem o uso desses biocombustíveis, considerando-os como inviáveis. De modo a 

combater esta controvérsia, a produção de biocombustíveis a partir de biomassa não-

comestível tem sido favorecida.   

Ao contrário dos biocombustíveis de primeira geração, a matéria-prima dos 

combustíveis de segunda geração provém geralmente de materiais lignocelulósicos 

não-comestíveis, não competindo com a produção de alimentos, eliminando assim a 

concorrência com as culturas alimentares. Contudo, estes biocombustíveis não podem 

ainda ser produzidos economicamente em grande escala, uma vez que a conversão de 



 

iv 
 

biomassa lignocelulósica em açúcares para posterior fermentação é um processo 

complexo, necessitando de equipamentos de produção e de processamento mais 

sofisticados, mais investimento por unidade de produção e instalações de grande 

escala. 

Os biocombustíveis de terceira geração utilizam microrganismos como uma alternativa 

às fontes agrícolas e animais, particularmente microrganismos oleaginosos (aqueles 

que têm a capacidade de acumular quantidades significativas de triacilgliceróis como 

materiais de reserva, e apresentam um teor de lípidos superior a 20% do seu peso seco 

em biomassa) para produção de biodiesel, não apresentando as desvantagens dos 

biocombustíveis de primeira e de segunda geração. 

A maior parte dos trabalhos de produção de biodiesel a partir de microrganismos 

oleaginosos focam-se na utilização de microalgas autotróficas. Estas crescem mais 

rápido, apresentam produtividades de biomassa e de lípidos mais elevadas e requerem 

uma menor área de cultivo comparativamente a culturas vegetais. No entanto, tem-se 

assistido a uma transição para culturas de microalgas heterotróficas devido a maior 

facilidade de cultivo e por apresentarem produção mais elevada de ácidos gordos em 

relação a culturas autotróficas. 

Outros microrganismos heterotróficos produtores de óleo, nomeadamente bactérias, 

fungos e leveduras também têm sido considerados como uma fonte promissora de 

biocombustível. 

A levedura Rhodotorula glutinis é uma espécie oleaginosa produtora de carotenóides, 

produtos de reserva com alto valor acrescentado de grande interesse comercial com 

aplicações nas indústrias de alimentação animal, farmacêutica e cosmética.  

A produção de biocombustíveis de terceira geração é um processo complexo e caro, 

pelo que, neste aspeto, não traz vantagem em relação aos combustíveis de 1ª geração . 

Contudo, a coprodução destes compostos intracelulares em conjunto com os lípidos da 

biomassa da levedura pode contribuir para reduzir significativamente os custos de 

produção de biodiesel a partir deste microrganismo. 

Neste trabalho, a levedura Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 (anamorfo de 

Rhodotorula glutinis) foi cultivada num bioreactor de 7 L com um volume de trabalho de 

5 L num sistema semi-contínuo com o objetivo de se otimizar a produção de ácidos 

gordos (para a produção de biodiesel) e de carotenóides. 

A estratégia geral de cultivo consistiu em dois passos distintos. Numa primeira fase, 

após o desenvolvimento da cultura de levedura em regime descontínuo, uma solução 

de nutrientes foi fornecida de modo a prolongar a fase de crescimento da levedura. Na 

segunda fase, assim que a levedura atingiu a fase estacionária, a solução de 

alimentação foi substituída por uma solução de glucose concentrada (600 g.L
-1

) para 



 

v 
 

induzir a síntese de materiais de reserva intracelulares, tais como lípidos e 

carotenóides.  

Foram realizados quatro ensaios no total. Cada ensaio durou, em média, uma semana, 

tendo sido recolhidas, pelo menos, três amostras por dia. Para cada amostra, foram 

analisados vários parâmetros incluindo a estimativa da concentração de glucose 

residual por meio de um teste qualitativo utilizando tiras de medição da concentração de 

glucose, valor de pH e a leitura da absorvência a um comprimento de onda de 600 nm. 

Outros métodos analíticos incluíram a determinação da concentração de azoto e 

glucose residuais, teor de lípidos totais e teor e composição em ácidos gordos.  

A primeira e últimas amostras recolhidas a cada dia também foram analisadas por 

citometria de fluxo, com o objetivo de detetar, em tempo real, o teor de carotenoides 

totais, assim como a viabilidade celular analisando a integridade da membrana 

citoplasmática e o potencial da membrana mitocondrial em simultâneo por medição da 

fluorescência emitida por células de levedura duplamente coradas com os fluorocromos 

iodeto de propídio e 3,3’-dihexiloxacarbocianina [DiOC6 (3)], respectivamente. 

Os dois primeiros ensaios foram realizados a valores de pH constantes. O primeiro foi 

realizado a pH 5,5, enquanto o pH no segundo ensaio foi alterado para 4,0 com o 

objetivo de melhorar a produtividade de biomassa e a produtividade em ácidos gordos.  

A alteração de pH no ensaio II resultou num aumento de 23,08% na concentração 

máxima de biomassa (119,61 g.L
-1

) e um aumento de 10,23% da produtividade máxima 

de biomassa (1,76 g.L
-1

) em comparação com o ensaio I. No entanto, o teor em ácidos 

gordos, percentagem total de lipídios e concentração de carotenóides no ensaio II foram 

menores do que no ensaio I devido a problemas associados à limitação de oxigénio. 

Para os ensaios III e IV, o pH do meio de cultura foi ajustado a 4,0 durante a fase de 

crescimento da levedura e, uma vez que a cultura atingiu a fase estacionária, foi 

novamente ajustado para a 5,0 para promover a acumulação de produtos lipídicos de 

armazenamento, tais como os carotenóides. A única diference entre os ensaios III e IV 

foi a utilização de uma turbina adicional adaptada ao eixo do rotor do bioreactor para o 

ensaio IV, de modo a garantir uma transferência de oxigénio mais eficiente no meio de 

cultura. O ensaio IV foi o que apresentou os resultados mais satisfatórios, obtendo-se 

valores mais elevados da concentração de biomassa (154,21 g.L

), produtividade de 

biomassa (2,35 g.L

Abstract 

In this work the yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 was grown in a 7 L 

bioreactor with a 5 L working volume in a fed-batch system with the aim of optimizing 

production of fatty acids (for biodiesel purposes) and carotenoids, a high-value added 

product with commercial interest. Several different cultivation strategies were studied.  

The first two experiments were performed at constant medium pH. The first fed-batch 

was carried out at a medium pH of 5.5, while the pH in the second assay was changed 

to 4.0, with the goal of enhancing biomass productivity and to further improve fatty acid 

and carotenoids productivities.  

A dual-stage strategy was used in the third fed-batch cultivation, with the yeast growth 

phase conducted at pH 4.0 and the stationary phase, where products accumulation 

occurs, was conducted at pH 5.0. These conditions were kept for the fourth assay, with 

the exception of an additional impeller adapted to the bioreactor’s rotor shaft in order to 

improve the oxygen transference in the broth. 

Assay four achieved the highest biomass concentration (154.21 g.L
-1

), biomass 

productivity (2.35 g.L
-1

.h
-1

), fatty acid productivity (0.40 g.L
-1

.h
-1

), total carotenoid  

concentration (0.29 mg.g
-1

), carotenoid productivity (0.29 mg.L
-1

.h
-1

) and total lipid 

content (41.07%), showing that the dual-stage strategy was successful and also that 

oxygen plays an essential role during the yeast cultivation, particularly in the carotenoid 

synthesis. 

Flow cytometry was used to monitor, in real time, total carotenoid content and cell 

viability (membrane potential and membrane integrity) throughout the yeast cultivations. 

The data obtained revealed a correlation between carbon source starvation, oxygen 

deficiency and damaged yeast’s cells.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Fossil fuel: The issue of peak oil and the need for biofuels 

The exploration and use of fossil fuels by mankind is an ongoing practice that has 

persisted for millennia and increased significantly about 250 years ago during the dawn 

of the Industrial Revolution, becoming the center of growth and trade [1-3]. Several 

major changes in our civilization since the beginning of the 20th century have increased 

dependence on a convenient energy source, mainly crude oil [1].  

Fossil energy has grown from insignificant levels in 1800 to an annual output of nearly 

10.000 million tons of oil equivalents [3] and still remains the driving force of current 

world economy and backbone of modern society, affecting the everyday lives of 

hundreds of millions of people worldwide to a point where it is considered an addiction 

[1]. Nowadays, fossil fuel accounts for 86% of global primary energy demand, with crude 

oil as the greater component, accounting for 36% demand followed by coal and natural 

gas at 27% and 23% respectively [4, 5], of which 58% alone is consumed by the 

transport sector [6].  

Recent forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [7], BP [8] and 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [9] indicate a future increase of 

fossil fuel demand. However, all fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources thus they 

obviously exist in finite quantities and cannot continue to meet this rising demand 

because their natural formation on a human scale is so slow (requires millions of years 

to create) that it simply cannot augment or replenish them faster than the rate at which 

they are currently being extracted [1- 3, 10, 11]. 

Concerns about natural resources depletion is not a recent issue, having been 

discussed since the end of the 18th to mid 19th centuries [12, 13, 14]. However, an 

accurate model for predicting production of finite resources was first published in 1956 

by geophysicist M.K. Hubbert (1903-1989) [15] who, despite great controversy at that 

time [1], correctly predicted that the peak oil (PO) in the US lower 48 states would occur 

in 1970 [1-3, 5]. His theory, now named the “Hubbert Peak Theory”, represents the 

production tendency of non-renewable resources by a symmetric bell-shaped curve [1, 

2, 5, 11, 16] where production initially increases and eventually reaches its maximum, 

represented by a peak or a plateau, after which inevitably starts to decline [4, 11, 16, 

17]. This happens because, initially, the extraction of an abundant and cheap resource 

leads to economic growth and investments increase, promoting further extraction [16]. 

Then, resources gradually become technically, energetically and economically more 

difficult to extract [4] (e.g. due to a fall in oil rig pressure and/or water infiltration [17]) and 

in time, lack of investment and rising prices result in slowed growth and, eventually, 

production starts falling to zero [16]. 



 

2 
 

The concept of PO is now well accepted and Hubbert’s theory continues to be the most 

widespread production prediction method used for fossil fuels [1].  

When the global production peak will exactly happen is still unknown. In 1998 two 

geologists, Jean Laherrère (1931- ) and Colin J. Campbell (1931- ), based on Hubbert’s 

research, published their own prediction of PO [18] which was expected to happen 

before 2010. Its influence led to the foundation of the Association for the Study of Peak 

Oil and gas (ASPO), the first and still the most important international organization which 

focuses on the study of PO [1].   

The ASPO offers a pessimistic view of PO from a geological standpoint [3, 10], 

supporting that oil deposits are fixed and, as a consequence, stocks decrease with 

consumption. It also expresses concern over decreasing production, stating that all the 

largest, therefore easier to locate, reserves have already been explored and future 

discoveries will be made in smaller and more remote areas and criticizes overestimation 

made by producing countries whose political and economic objectives may encourage 

reserve misreporting for their own benefit [2, 10]. According to these statements, the 

effective PO date should not be very distant [1]. 

The opposing, optimistic side is represented by economists [3, 10] who disagree with the 

geologists’ overly pessimistic opinions. Although they don’t dismiss the possibility of PO 

from ever happening, their main argument is that there is no reason to worry because 

available resources are big enough and that it will only occur after several decades [16]. 

It is this lack of consensus that increases speculation as to when PO will actually take 

place, with time periods ranging from 2010 to 2040 [10]. Whichever the calculated date, 

signs of crude oil exhaustion are becoming more evident [1] and sooner or later it will 

completely run out. 

Besides availability, there is also the problem of environmental impact from exploring 

and combusting fossil fuels, mainly CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, which are 

closely related to pollution and climate change, with levels expected to rise in the future 

[2-5, 6-11, 19-22]. Peaking of conventional (fossil) oil also plays a role in the 

environment because scarcity of conventional reserves, which are the most accessible 

and whose production poses less technical challenges [2], will result in production 

switching to dirtier unconventional oils (e.g. tar sands) [16] that have larger emission 

footprints [2, 3] due to their extraction being capital intensive and requiring additional 

energy [2]. 

Due to all the aforementioned reasons, attention has shifted towards development of 

renewable, biodegradable, cheap, sustainable, environmental friendly, freely available in 

nature and efficient alternative energies [6, 19, 20]. 



 

3 
 

Among several fossil fuel substitutes, biofuels, hydrogen, natural gas and synthesis gas 

are seen as the most sustainable [6]. Within these four, biofuels are the most 

environment-friendly choice; hence, biofuels are now being explored [6].  

Biofuels are referred to liquid, gas and solid fuels predominantly generated from 

biological material [6, 20, 22]. The available types of biofuels are bioethanol, renewable 

methanol, biodiesel, biogas, biobutanol and biohydrogen [20] and are the answer to 

reducing both dependence on fossil energy and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions as 

well as providing steady income for farmers [6, 23]. 

 

1.2. First, second and third generation biofuels 

Classification of biofuels falls under two categories: primary and secondary. The first 

category is defined by organic material that is directly combusted in its natural and non-

modified chemical form (e.g. fuelwood, wood chips and pellets, etc.), used primarily for 

heating, cooking and producing electricity. The second comes from processed biomass 

that exists in solid, gas or liquid forms and can be used for transportation and in various 

industrial processes [6, 23]. Secondary biofuels are further categorized in to first, second 

and third-generation biofuels [6, 23]. 

First and second generation biofuels share the same biotechnological background: 

conversion of carbohydrates to alcohol and/or methane gas and biodiesel production 

through fatty acid hydrolysis with methanol in the presence of a catalyst to glycerol and 

long chain alkyl esters (diesel) in a transesterification reaction [24]. The difference 

between the two is the feedstock [24].  

First-generation biofuels are derived from food crops for human consumption (rice, 

wheat, barley, potato wastes, sugar beets etc.) and vegetable oils (soybean oil, 

sunflower oil, corn oil, olive oil, palm oil, coconut oil, rapeseed oil, mustard oil, castor oil 

etc.) [19, 22, 24, 25]. The most well-known first-generation biofuel is bioethanol [6] using 

sugar-cane as a common feedstock, Brazil being the main country that produces and 

uses it [19, 22]. Nonetheless, first-generation biofuels raise some concerns regarding its 

sustainability. With global population steadily increasing, more food will be required to 

meet its needs. As the production capacity of first-generation biofuels increases, so does 

their conflict with food supply due to pressure on agricultural land (e.g. the intensive use 

of land with high fertilizer and pesticide applications and water) leading to environmental 

problems, rise in costs and hunger threats from food shortages, especially in developing 

countries where more than 800 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition [6, 23, 

25-29]. Consequently, many agencies, particularly food and agricultural organizations 

and economic modelers consider the use of these biofuels as unviable [28] and efforts 

are being made to use non-edible biomass for the production of biofuels [6]. 



 

4 
 

Second-generation biofuels emerge as a solution to the food versus fuel controversy 

because, unlike first-generation biofuels, they do not compete with food production as 

their feedstock generally comes from non-edible lignocellulosic rich materials, 

eliminating competition with food crops [6, 22-24, 27]. Examples of different feedstocks 

include Jatropha curcas, lesquerella oil, cotton seed, Pongamia glabra, karanja and 

Salvadora oleoides, linseed oil, forestry residues, switch grass, wood and biomass 

sources [20]. Second-generation biofuels offer a number of advantages. Some feedstock 

species can be grown in largely unproductive areas and are mostly located in degraded 

forest and coastal areas; they are biodegradable and are 15–20% more efficient when 

mixed with petroleum diesel in different proportions without the need to modify engines 

and emit less carbon gases [20]. They also exhibit desirable fuel properties such as high 

cetane number, very high flash point, excellent lubricity and very favorable energy 

balance [20]. However, second-generation biofuels cannot yet be produced 

economically in a large scale, since converting the lignocellulosic biomass into 

fermentable sugars is a complex process [22-24]. Therefore, production of second-

generation biofuels requires more sophisticated processing equipment, more investment 

per unit of production and large-scale facilities [6]. 

Third generation biofuels focus on microorganisms [6] as an alternative to agricultural 

and animal sources [30], particularly oil-accumulating microbes such as microalgae, 

bacteria, yeasts and other fungi [31] whose oil can be extracted and converted into 

biodiesel. Biofuels from microorganisms are devoid of the major disadvantages related 

with biofuels derived from plant crops [6] since their cultivation isn’t dependant on 

seasons and climate, presenting properties similar to vegetable oil [32].  

A microorganism is considered to be oleaginous if it has the capability to accumulate 

significant quantities of storage triacylglycerols (TAGs) [33] and a lipid content exceeding 

20% of their dry biomass weight [30, 34-36]. Lipid accumulation in these microorganisms 

is dependent on nitrogen availability [30]. Once this nutrient is exhausted, the excess 

carbon present is assimilated by the cells and converted into TAGs during the stationary 

phase, when cell growth and division is halted, and lipid accumulates within existing cells 

[30]. 

Third-generation biofuels production mainly focuses on microalgae [23]. Microalgae, as 

a feedstock for third-generation biofuels production, are inexpensive, environmentally 

friendly, fully renewable, and can be used in a wide range of fuel blends such as diesel, 

petrol, and jet fuel and aviation gasoline [20]. Generally they have higher biomass and 

lipid productivities and grow faster when compared to oilseed crops [26]. Species such 

as Chlorella contain around 60-70% lipid content and high lipid productivity (7.4 g.L
-1

.d
-1
 

for Chlorella protothecoides) [22], need much less land area (up to 49 or 132 times less) 



 

5 
 

and can have up to 100 times more oil content when compared to oilseed crops [26, 28], 

reaching 5000 gallons per acre, in contrast with 1000 gallons per acre from common 

vegetable oils. They are able to produce, theoretically, up to a yield of 20,000 gallons of 

feedstock per acre of land, depending on the species [28]. The estimated market size for 

algae is $425 billions, which is more than twice the expected market size for other 

traditional biofuels [28]. 

Microalgae can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic [23]. Autotrophism uses inorganic 

carbon sources, and can be further classified according to the source of energy either in 

to photoautrophism (autotrophic photosynthesis) if using light or chemoautotrophism if 

the energy comes from oxidized inorganic compounds. Heterotrophic microalgae require 

an organic carbon source to grow. Like in autotrophism, they can be categorized 

according to the energy source in to photoheterotrophs or chemoheterotrophs. Some 

strains can combine autotrophic photosynthesis and heterotrophic assimilation of 

organic compounds, called mixotrophs. [6, 23, 29, 37] 

At present, most of the works aiming at microbial biodiesel production use autotrophic 

microalgae [29, 38] to limit cost of input materials [31]. Indeed they are efficient CO2 

fixers, requiring considerable amounts of this greenhouse effect gas to convert it into 

biomass using solar energy, they can be used as a cheaper mode of CO2 sequestration 

in oil and gas facilities and related industrial power plants, and are considered almost 

carbon neutral [26, 28]. However, their growth is much slower than bacteria or fungi. 

Moreover, autotrophic cultures have low biomass and oil yields, due to limitations of light 

and oxygen accumulation [38], are dependent on climate, are easily contaminated by 

other microorganisms and require large areas and high amounts of water [31]. Thus, 

future research should be focused on heterotrophic cultivation [29]. 

Heterotrophic algae cultivation systems are carried out in the absence of light. 

Therefore, it is easy to cultivate them at large scales without depending on light 

requirements [29]. Despite the additional cost from having to provide the culture with the 

carbon source, heterotrophic systems easily compensate for this due to increased oil 

content and cell density in a shorter time [31]. A specific study by Liu et al [39] shows the 

benefits of using heterotrophic algae for biodiesel production, with a 900% increase in 

lipid yield using the heterotrophic Chlorella zofingiensis compared to autotrophic 

conditions.  

In addition to heterotrophic microalgae, other heterotrophic oleaginous microorganisms 

such as bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeasts have been considered as potential 

source oil for biodiesel production, because they can produce appreciable amounts of 

lipids when cultured in conventional bioreactors and under strictly controlled conditions 

(which reduces the risk of contaminations), reaching higher biomass and lipid yields [40].  



 

6 
 

Although bacteria have higher growth rates and shorter growth periods than microalgae, 

most of the species have lower lipid content, on average 20-40% of dry biomass [30]. 

However, only a few strains are known to synthesize lipids and, since they are stored in 

the outer membrane, it is difficult to extract them efficiently [30]. For these reasons, there 

is currently no industrial application of bacterial feedstocks for biofuel production [30]. 

For decades, oleaginous yeasts have been studied as a microbial source of oil [31]. 

Compared to microalgae, conventional microbial bioreactors can be used to cultivate 

these microorganisms, resulting in improved biomass yield and, consequently, lesser 

biomass and oil production costs [35]. 

Of 600 known yeast species [41], over 70 are considered oleaginous and oleaginicity 

screenings are still uncovering new oil producing yeast species [31]. These species are 

generally from, but not limited to, the genera Candida, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, 

Rhizopus, Trichosporon, Lipomyces, and Yarrowia and can accumulate lipids 40-70% of 

their biomass depending on the conditions in which they are grown [41]. 

 

1.3. The yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides 

Species of the genus Rhodotorula date all the way back to Fresenius in 1850 with the 

description of Cryptococcus glutinis [42]. The genus was formally described by Harrison 

in 1928 [43] to include red yeasts that did not produce spores while other pigmented 

yeasts were placed in Chromotorula, a genus that would be later rejected by Lodder in 

1934 [44] who attributed the genus Rhodotorula to all carotenoid producing species.  

In the first edition of the book entitled “The Yeasts, A Taxonomic Study”, Rhodotorula 

yeasts were notable for seldom exhibiting primitive pseudomycelia, synthesizing 

carotenoids and lacking fermentation [45]. Seven species were accepted in this edition. 

Supplementary descriptions were made in the second edition published in 1970, adding 

Rhodotorula’s inability to assimilate inositol and to synthesize starch-like compounds 

[46]. Nine species were recorded in the genus.  

By this time, studies on the sexuality of Rhodotorula confirmed its basidiomycetous 

nature. Investigations by Banno, I. led to the observation that, in Rhodotorula, 

conjugation of haploid cells gave rise to a mycelial stage presenting a dikaryotic 

mycelium with clamp-connections, indicating a correspondence to a secondary 

mycelium of Basidiomycetes, concluding that the Rhodotorula yeasts capable of mating 

are simply the haploid stage of a basidiomycetous fungus [47, 48]. The perfect name 

given to the two sexually compatible strains of Rhodotorula glutinis which Banno studied 

is Rhodosporidium toruloides Banno, the type species of the genus [49]. 

This major finding changed the definition of the genus Candida. Ascomycetous species 

were retained in this genus while the basidiomycetous species were separated based on 



 

7 
 

the composition of cell hydrolyzates [50]. Species with xylose in the cell hydrolyzates 

were placed in Cryptococcus and those which lacked xylose were transferred to 

Rhodotorula [50]. 

The Rhodotorula genus, as currently defined, includes 34 species that comprise a 

polyphyletic group of organisms. Cultures have a coral pink color, are smooth and moist 

to mucoid, with variable growth at 37ºC with a diameter between three to five 

micrometers and grow as ellipsoid, multipolar budding yeast [51]. 

Rhodotorula glutinis is one of the 34 species, classified taxonomically in the super-

kingdom Eukaria, kingdom Fungi, sub-kingdom Dikaria, phylum Basidiomycota, sub-

phylum Puciniomycotina, class Microbotriomycetes, order Sporidiobolales and genus 

Rhodotorula [52]. No family has yet been assigned [53].  

Compared to algae, fungi and bacteria, Rhodotorula glutinis exhibits higher growth rate 

and can accumulate lipids under low-cost substrates [32]. 

Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 is an anamorph of this yeast [54, 55].  

 

1.4. Carotenoids 

Carotenoids are isoprenoids containing a characteristic polyene chain of conjugated 

double bonds and are either acyclic or cyclic with one or two cyclic end groups [56]. 

There is a great variety of carotenoids, with more than 600 different compounds [56-60].  

Carotenoids are important in nature as they confer color to plants and animals 

specifically birds, insects, fish, and crustaceans [57]. The coloration of flamingoes and 

salmon is a common example of pigmentation from the presence of the carotenoid 

astaxanthin [59]. Other carotenoids can also give purple, crimson and burgundy colors to 

feathers of some birds [59].  

Carotenoid synthesis is present in plants, bacteria, fungi, and algae [57]. Animals lack 

this ability, and are therefore only able to incorporate them from their diet [57]. Of all the 

existing carotenoids, about 40 are found in the human diet and less than half of these 

are known to be present in humans [61], with 90% of the carotenoids in the diet and 

human body represented by ?-carotene, ?-carotene, lycopene, lutein and cryptoxanthin 

[58, 60].  

Intake comes primarily from fruits and vegetables [62]. Yellow and orange fruits and 

vegetables and green leafy vegetables contain ?-carotene whilst ?-carotene is mainly 

found in carrots. Tomatoes and tomato based foods account for over 85% of all dieta ry 

sources of lycopene; spinach and kale are a source of high levels of lutein and 

zeaxanthin; orange fruits, such as tangerine and papaya, have large amounts of ?-

cryptoxanthin [58, 62]. Additionally, smaller carotenoid amounts can be obtained from 



 

8 
 

dairy products, egg yolks, and ocean fish and in colorants added to processed foods 

[58].  

Increasing commercial interest of carotenoids is connected to their potential benefits in 

human and animal health [63]. Carotenoids are seen as biomarkers, as they have the 

potential to give an accurate estimate of a person’s overall health [59]. Many clinical 

trials show a positive association between dietary carotenoids and decreased risk of 

several disorders such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, age-related progressive eye 

loss and cognitive decline [57-65] due to their physiological functions such serving as 

vitamin A precursors and antioxidants [57-66].  

Carotenoids are currently used in feed, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries and 

have high commercial value with a global market accounted for 766 million dollars 

expected to increase by 155 million dollars in the current year [67] 

Despite the availability of a variety of natural and synthetic carotenoids, microbial 

sources of carotenoids have received increasing attention because of the restricted rules 

and regulations currently applied to chemically synthesized/purified pigments [65]. 

Among these sources, Rhodotorula sp. is a well known carotenoid producer [63, 65]. 

The 4 main carotenoids produced by this species are torularhodin, torulene, ?-carotene 

and ?-carotene [68] (Figure 1). 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1. Chemical structure of ?-carotene, ?-carotene, torularhodin and torulene, the 4 main 
carotenoids produced by Rhodotorula sp. (Adapted from Moliné et al. [68]). 

Yeasts are better suited than algae or molds for large-scale carotenoid production in 

fermenters, due to their unicellular nature and high growth rate [63]. Besides, yeasts can 

adapt to different environmental conditions and grow under a wide variety of carbon and 

nitrogen sources [68].

1.5. Sustainable production of biodiesel from Rhodosporidium toruloides 

Currently, the production of biodiesel from microorganisms is not economically feasible 

because it is an expensive process compared to first generation fuels [54].  

However, Rhodosporidium toruloides biomass has a high lipid content and is also rich in 

high-value added products such as carotenoids (section 1.4.). The co-extraction and 

commercialization of these two products may help reduce the overall process cost [54, 

55]. 

 

2. Scope of present study 

This work's main objective was to optimize production of lipids and carotenoids by the 

oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 using a bench bioreactor 

operating in a fed-batch regime, with glucose as the carbon source. Different medium pH 

changes strategies were used in order to improve lipids and carotenoids production. 

Flow cytometry (FC) was used to monitor, in real time, various cell parameters such as 

total carotenoids (TC) content and cell viability.  

On a personal level, this work was conducted as part of a master's thesis in order to 

assimilate the maximum of experimental techniques and as much knowledge possible.

table A1 (see annex I.). All equipment will be mentioned along this section. 

 

3.2. Microorganism 

The strain used was Rhodosporium toruloides NCYC 921, supplied by the National 

Collection of Yeast Cultures (Norwich, United Kingdom).  

Yeast cells were kept in Malt Extract Agar (MEA) (in g.L
-1

: agar, 15; malt extract, 30; 

mycological peptone, 5) slants at 4ºC until needed. 

 

3.3. Pre-inoculum preparation 

Pre-cultures were prepared by transferring R.toruloides cells from two MEA slants at 

30ºC for 72 h to 1 L baffled flasks containing 150 mL of sterilized growth medium. The 

glucose solution (35 g.L
-1

) was sterilized separately and mixed aseptically.  

Medium pH was adjusted to 4 before transferring the yeast cells. Shaken incubation was 

performed at 30ºC at 150 rpm (Unitrom Infors, Switzerland) for 24 hours (exponential 

growth phase).  

All pre-cultures were performed in duplicate to account for any possible contamination.

3.5.  Fermentation in a bioreactor 

Fed-batch microbial cultivation trials were carried out in a fermenter (Electrolab Fermac 

310/60 bioreactor, United Kingdom) with a 5 L working volume (total volume 7 L). The 

vessel initially contained 2.85 L of concentrated cultivation media with a salt 

concentration for 5 L, and 35 g.L
-1

 glucose with 1.25 mL trace minerals.  

Temperature control was achieved using a PT100 sensor to measure vessel 

temperature and a low voltage (24 V) control wrap-around heating system with a cold 

finger heat exchange for cooling.  

The pH was monitored by an autoclavable pH electrode and adjusted by automatic 

addition of 5 M HCl or 5 M NaOH using two separate peristaltic pumps (Watson Marlow).  

Dissolved oxygen (DO) was monitored by an autoclavable polarographic DO electrode, 

controlled by stirrer speed, air flow, or combination of both.  

Polypropylene glycol (PPG) was used as an anti-foaming agent, added by an automatic 

peristaltic pump, controlled by a conductivity probe.

The feeding strategy consisted of two distinct steps. In an initial phase, after a previous 

batch culture, a nutrient solution (in g.L
-1

: MgSO4.7H2O, 9; Yeast Extract, 20; Glucose, 

600) was supplied to the yeast to extend its exponential phase. Secondly, once the 

yeast reached the stationary phase, the feeding solution was replaced by 600 g.L
-1
 

concentrated glucose solution
 
to induce the synthesis of intracellular storage materials 

such as lipids and carotenoids.  

Fermentations lasted a week on average, and three samples were collected per day. For 

each sample, several parameters were analyzed including the estimation of the residual 

glucose concentration, by means of a qualitative test using Combur-Test
® 

strips, pH 

value (Consor C3021, Belgium) and absorbency at 600 nm (ThermoSpectronic Genesys 

20). The first and last samples collected per day were also analysed by flow cytometry to 

evaluate at-line cell viability (section 3.8.1) and carotenoid content (section 3.8.2).  

The contents of the three samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 9000 rpm at 5ºC 

(Avanti J-25 I Centrifuge Beckman, USA) and the supernatant stored at -18 ° C for 

further analysis of residual glucose (section 3.6.2) and nitrogen (section 3.6.3). The 

biomass (pellet) was also stored at -18 ° C for further analysis of fatty acids (section 

3.6.4) and total lipids (section 3.6.5). 

 

3.6. Analytical Methods 

3.6.1. Biomass quantification 

Biomass was measured by optical density (OD) at 600 nm wavelength in a 

spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic
®
 Genesys 20, Portugal).  

A linear regression was used to establish the correlation between OD and dry cell weight 

(DCW). This correlation is expressed by the equation: OD600 nm = 0.7062 [biomass] + 

0.4338 (R
2
 = 0.9986). 

 

3.6.2. Residual glucose concentration 

Residual reducing sugar concentration was determined by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid 

(DNS) method [70].  

From a glucose stock solution (1.5 g.L
-1

), six standard solutions were made by 

performing serial dilutions, in distilled water, with concentrations ranging from 1.5 g/L to 

0.75 g/L with a 10 mL final volume (10, 8, 5, 1, 0.5, 0)  in order to establish a calibration 

curve to determine the glucose concentration in the samples. Supernatant samples were 

diluted appropriately so that absorvance values would not deviate from those registered 

in the calibration curve.  

To a 0.5 mL sample volume, 0.5 mL DNS reagent [5g DNS, 8g NaOH and 150g 

potassium sodium tartarate (KNaC4H4O6·4H2O), in 500 mL distilled water] was added. The 



 

12 
 

mixture was vortexed fo 5 seconds, sealed and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, 

followed by 5 min in an ice bath to stop the reaction. The mixture was diluted in distilled 

water (5 mL) and vortexed once more. Sugar concentration was determined according to 

samples' spectrophotometrical readings at a 550 nm wavelength. Standard solutions and 

samples were analysed in duplicate and triplicate, respectively. 

 

3.6.3. Nitrogen quantification 

Quantification of total nitrogen was done according to the classical Kjeldahl method [71].  

Supernatant samples (5 mL) were weighed in Kjeldahl digestion tubes with a 800 mL 

capacity. Conversion of amino nitrogen of organic components present in the samples 

into ammonium sulphate occured for 2 to 3 hours in the presence of 12 M H 2SO4 and a 

catalyst [30g copper sulfate (CuSO4), 30g titanium dioxide (TiO2), 10g stearic acid 

(C18H36O2) and 930 g potassium sulfate (K2SO4)] until samples became pale green, 

indicating complete digestion.  

Ammonia was distilled from an alkaline solution (NaOH 50%) and absorbed in a 4% 

H3BO3 solution containing two drops of pH indicator (2g methyl red and 1g methylene 

blue in 100 mL 95% (v/v) ethanol).  

Ammonia content was determined by titration with 0.1 N HCl, with the indicator's colour 

shifting from green to violet once the pH reached 4.8. Total nitrogen percentage in each 

sample is given by the following equation: 

Equation 1 - Nitrogen content, given in percentage (nitrogen mass / 100 mL sample).  V = 

Volume in mL 0.1 N HCl used in sample titration. m = sample mass expressed in grams. 

 

3.6.4. Derivatization and identification of fatty acids 

Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were obtained according to the method described by 

Lepage and Roy (1986) [72], modified by Cohen et al (1988) [73]. 

Transesterification was accomplished by adding 2 mL methanol/acetyl chloride (95:5, 

v/v) and 0.2 mL internal standard [heptadecanoic acid, 17:0 (5 mg.mL
-1

, Nu-Check-Prep, 

Elysian, USA) to 0.1 g freeze-dryed (Heto
®
 PowerDry LL3000 Freeze Dryer with 

Vacuubrand
®
 vacuum pump) yeast biomass. The mixture was sealed under a saturated 

nitrogen atmosphere and heated at 80ºC for 1 h, protected from light.  

After cooling to room temperature, samples were diluted with 1 mL water to facilitate 

phase formation. Extraction was made with 1 mL n-heptane. The heptanoic (upper) 

phase was filtered through a cotton and anydrous sodium sulphate filter and collected 

into light-protected teflon-lined vials under nitrogen atmosphere. Analysis was performed

in a gas chromatograph (SCION GC 436 with Kombi Moisture/HydroCarbon Filter 

helium, air and hydrogen filters also from Bruker, Germany) equipped with a flame 

ionization detector (FID). Separation of the compounds was carried out on a 30 m long 

Supelcowax 10 (Supelco) capillary column with a 0.32 mm internal diameter and 0.25 

mm film thickness. The initial column temperature was programmed to 200ºC for 20 min 

until it reached a final temperature of 220ºC. Injector and detector temperatures were 

250ºC and 280ºC, respectively. Helium gas was used as carrier at a flow rate of 1.3 

ml/mL. Methyl esters were identified by comparison of retention times of the standard 

components 461 (Nu-Chek-Prep, Elysian, MN, USA).  

Extractions were performed in duplicate and injected twice. Quantification of individual 

fatty acids was done in accordance with the following equation: 

Equation 2 - Quantification of fatty acids. mFA = amount of fatty acid; AFA = fatty acid peak area; 

AIS = area of the peak corresponding to the internal standard (17:0); RFFA = fatty acid response 

factor (RF = 1 for all fatty acids). 

 

3.6.5. Total lipids extraction 

The protocol chosen for evaluation of total yeast lipid content was adapted from a 

standard method for determination of oil content in oleaginous seeds [74].  

Freeze-dryed R. toruloides cells were broken in a ball mill (Retsch
®
 MM 400 ball mill) set 

to its maximum vibrational frequency for 3.5 min using 10 cm diameter metal spheres. 

This process was facilitated by previously grinding and crushing the dry biomass using a 

mortar and pestle.  

One gram of ruptured cells was weighed into a porous cellulose thimble, which was then 

tightly packed and loaded into a Soxhlet apparatus. Continuous extraction lasted for a 

total of 9 hours, with hexane (100 mL) as the organic solvent.  

The solvent containing the oils (noticeable by its bright orange colour) was collected  into 

tared (sonicated for 15 min in regular tap water, then thoroughly washed with deionized 

water, ethanol and acetone prior to being placed in an oven at 100ºC for 16 hours) round 

base flasks. The deoiled biomass left inside the thimble was stored at -20ºC. Oil extracts 

that were cloudy, due to some solid particles that managed to be dragged along with the 

solvent, were filtered through a membrane filter. Dry extracts were obtained removing 

the organic solvent by vacuum using a Rotavapor. All extractions were performed in 

duplicate.

3.6.6. Carotenoids extraction 

Freeze-dryed yeast biomass was ground in ball mill for 3 min at a frequency of 25 Hz 

using 5 cm diameter metal spheres. A quantity of 0.150 g was suspended in 2 mL 

DMSO in tin foil covered plastic test tubes (to prevent carotenoid degradation by 

exposure to light) containing acid-washed 425-600 µm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich
®
). 

The suspension was stirred in a vortex mixer for 1 min and placed in a water bath at 

55ºC for 1 h, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 3900 rpm. These steps were 

repeated once and the supernatants transferred to a separatory funnel.  

The pellet was ressuspended in 2 mL acetone and the extraction was carried out in the 

same way as with DMSO, and repeated several times until the pellet lost all its pigments 

and the acetone became colorless.  

The acetone extract was mixed with the DMSO fraction and serial washed with 2 mL 

20% NaCl solution at 5°C, 5 mL hexane or petroleum ether and 5-10 mL distilled water 

at 5ºC. The immiscible solvent mixture was vigorously shaken for about 30 seconds, 

releasing occasional accumulated vapor pressure inside the separation funnel until the 

colored (upper) phase became translucid. The two immiscible layers were then left to sit, 

after which the aqueous (bottom) phase was discarded and the organic fraction collected 

into a glass flask and evaporated under vacuum using a rotavapor (Buchi
®
 R-200 

Rotavapor with a R-490 Heating Bath and V-800 vacuum controller).  

The dry extract was ressuspended in hexane and passed through cotton and anhydrous 

sodium sulfate in order to remove traces of water then evaporated under a gentle stream 

of nitrogen and resuspended in 3 mL filtered acetone.  This step was performed twice. 

 

a) Quantification by UV-VIS spectrophotometry 

Absorption spectra of extracts were obtained in the visible radiation range (380-700 nm) 

using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV-VIS recording 

spectrophotometer).  

TC were calculated by the Beer-Lambert law using an extinction coefficient 

corresponding to that of beta-carotene in acetone at a wavelength of 450 nm [? = 2630 l / 

(10g.cm)].  

 

b) Identification and quantification by HPLC 

HPLC with a UV-VIS detector set to 450 nm was used to analyze the extracts. The 

system used consisted of a ?-Bondapack C18 reversed phase (250 x 4.0 mm) column 

with methanol [0.1% triethylamine (TEA)]: acetonitrile: ethyl acetate (75:15:10) as the 

mobile phase. Samples were eluted for 12 min at a flow rate of 0.8 mL.min
-1

. Beta-

carotene was identified by comparing retention times of the carotenoid in the sample 



 

15 
 

with the retention time of the standard (Sigma
 
97% ?-carotene, United Kingdom). 

Standard solutions of ?-carotene, with concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 6.5 ?g.mL
-1

, 

were used for the calibration curve (total ?-carotene content (?g.mL-1) = Area x 0.003 + 

0.0022) which was used to determine the total content of ?-carotene. The identification 

of other carotenoids (torulene and torularhodin) was made by comparison of the 

chromatograms obtained with those reported in the literature for a similar system. 

 

3.7. Kinetic Parameters 

In order to characterize growth, lipid and carotenoid production of R.toruloides, several 

kinetic parameters were calculated. 

 

3.7.1. Biomass productivity 

Biomass productivity was calculated using the following equation: 

    
     

     
 

Equation 3 - Biomass productivity [PX (gbiomass.L
-1

.h

)] in relation with t = 0h. Xi (g.L
-1

)= biomass 
concentration at t = i; X0 (g.L

-1
)= biomass concentration at t = 0h; ti = time at i (h); t0 = initial time 

(t = 0h) 

 

3.7.2. Total fatty acid productivity and percentage 

Total fatty acid productivity and percentage were calculated using the following 

equations, respectively: 

         
                    

   
 

Equation 4 - Total fatty acid productivity [PTFA (gTFA.L

)]. PX = biomass productivity (gbiomass.L
-

1
.h

-1
); %TFA (wTFA/wbiomass) = percentage of Total Fatty Acids in relation to the biomass. 

The %TFA was calculated according to the following equation: 

                    
   

       
     

Equation 5 – Total fatty acid percentage [%TFA (wtfa/wbiomass)]; mFA = total fatty acid amount 
(mg); msample = yeast biomass amount (mg). 

 

 

 

 



 

16 
 

3.7.3. Fatty acid composition 

Fatty acid composition was calculated according to the following equation: 

                
    

    
     

Equation 6 – Percentage of each fatty acid in total fatty acid weight. %FAi (Pfa/Ptfa) = percentage 
of fatty acid i; mFAi = fatty acid i weight (mg); mTFA = total fatty acid weight (mg), calculated by 
the sum of all fatty acids weights. 

 

3.7.4. Total carotenoid productivity 

TC productivity was calculated using the following equation: 

             

Equation 7 - TC productivity [PTC (mgtc.L

). 

 

3.8. Flow Cytometry 

A flow cytometer (FACScalibur, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) equipped 

with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm and photomultipliers FL1 (530 ± 30 nm), FL2 (585 

± 42 nm), FL3 (&gt; 670 nm) and FL4 (600 ± 16 nm) was used to monitor the cytoplasmic 

membrane integrity, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic membrane potentials, enzymatic 

activity and to quantify TC content in R. toruloides cells throughout the cultivations.  

 

3.8.1.  Plasma membrane integrity and mitochondrial potential 

Cytoplasmic membrane integrity and potential were simultaneously monitored by 

fluorescence emitted by yeast cells double stained with the fluorochromes propidium 

iodide (PI) (Invitrogen, USA) and 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide [DiOC6(3)] 

(Invitrogen, USA), respectively. 

PI is excluded by viable cells [75], as the stain passes through only damaged cell 

membranes, intercalating with the nucleic acids of injured and dead cells to form a bright 

red fluorescent complex [76, 77]. PI is excited at 536 nm and emits at 623 nm, so the 

fluorescence of cells stained with this fluorochrome can be detected both in FL2 and FL3 

channels [40]. DiOC6(3) is a positively charged lipophilic carbocyanine stain that 

accumulates intracellularly in polarized or hyperpolarized cytoplasmic and mitochondrial 

membranes [54]. DiOC6(3) is excited at 484 nm and the fluorescence of the stained cells 

is measured at 501 nm may be detected in the FL1 channel [40].  

Stock PI solution concentration was 1 mg.mL
-1

 (in filtered milli-Q water) and  

final solution concentration in the cell suspension was 0.5 ?g.mL
-1

. DiOC6 (3) stock 



 

17 
 

solution concentration was 10 ng.mL
-1 

in DMSO, and the final solution concentration was 

5 ng·mL
-1

.  

Samples taken throughout the trials were sonicated (Transsonic T 660/H, Elma, 

Germany) for 10 seconds to avoid cell aggregation, and diluted in phosphate buffer 

saline [PBS, pH 7.3 ± 0.2 (Oxoid, England)] in order to obtain about 800 to 1,000 events 

per second. Next, 0.5 ?L DiOC6(3) were added to 499 ?L diluted sample. The mixture 

was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 5 min, after which 0.5 ?L IP were 

added and cells analysed immediately.  

All buffers and Mili-Q water were filtered through 0.2 µm membrane filters (TPP Syringe 

filter 22, Switzerland and White nitrocellulose membrane filters, Filtres Fioroni, France, 

for buffer solutions and Mili-Q water, respectively) 

Data obtained by multiparametric FC was analyzed in FCS Express 4 Flow Research 

Edition program.  

 

3.8.2. At-line TC analysis 

TC content was determined by measuring the autofluorescence of the yeast cells. To 

this end, we previously established a correlation between the autofluorescence of yeast 

cells read in the FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels and TC quantified by HPLC for the same 

samples. Since the content of carotenoids increases with the aging of the culture [54], 

the correlation was established by analyzing samples taken at different phases of cell 

growth. Thus, it is possible to correlate autofluorescence readings obtained by FC with 

the TC content through a linear regression [54]. 

The samples were sonicated (T Transsonic 660 / H, Elma, Germany) for 10 seconds to 

remove any cell aggregates and ensure individual analysis of cells. Next, the samples 

were diluted in phosphate buffer saline [PBS, pH 7.3 ± 0.2 (Oxoid, England)] in order to 

obtain between 800 and 1,000 events per second. Autofluorescence was then read for 

quantification of TC. 

For the first sample, collected at the beginning of yeast growth, autofluorescence in the 

FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels was adjusted at the first logarithmic decade. This setting 

was used for subsequent readings made throughout the trials. 

 

4. Results and discussion 

4.1. Carotenoid quantification by HPLC 

According to Freitas et al. (2014), the yeast cells autofluorescence can be used for at 

line detection of carotenoid content in yeasts, using FC [54]. However, the correlation 

described in that work, where R. toruloides NCYC 921 was cultivated in shake flasks, 

could not be used in the present work, because it was found that the biomass produced 



 

18 
 

in our bench bioreactor had a carotenoid composition different from the one observed in 

shake flasks. As a result, the yeast cells emitted fluorescence at different wave lengths 

when cultivated in different systems. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a new 

correlation between the TC content determined by the conventional method (extraction, 

and quantification of these compounds by HPLC), and the autofluorescence of cells 

measured by FC (see sections 3.6.6.and 3.8.2.). 

Figure 2 shows the TC content and individual carotenoids (?-carotene, torulene, 

torularhodin) in mgcarotenoids.gdry cell wieght

, determined by HPLC analysis of samples taken 

during assay I. Figure 3 displays the composition of carotenoids, in percentage.

Figure 3. Carotenoid composition (percentage) in R.toruloides NCYC 921 biomass collected 
throughout assay I (section 4.2.1).  
 

Through the analysis of Figures 2 and 3, it can be concluded that torulene was always 

the carotenoid produced in greater amounts, reaching a maximum of 59.00% of TC 

content (corresponding to 0.31 mg.g
-1

). The percentage of ?-carotene decreased during 

the assay. Initially, the yeast biomass contained 40.34% (5x10
-4

 mg.g
-1

) of ?-carotene of 

TC content, and at the end reaches and stabilizes at 14.50% (0.08 mg.g
-1

). Torularhodin 

percentage increased, reaching a maximum at t = 43 h with 31.95% (0.02 mg.g
-1

) and 

decreases slightly to the end of the test, ending at 25.55% (0.13 mg.g
-1

).

4.1.1. Autofluorescence measured by FC 

The autofluorescence of R. toruloides cells detected in FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels show 

similar profiles, with higher autofluorescence values observed in the FL2 channel, as is 

evident in Figure 4. 

 

Figure 4. Autofluorescence of R. toruloides cells detected in FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels, 
throughout assay I (section 4.2.1). 

 

4.1.2. Correlation between autofluorescence and TC 

Correlations were calculated for each autofluorescence measured in FL1, FL2 and FL3 

channels versus TC content. The best correlation was found for TC content versus 

autofluorescence detected in the FL2 channel (Figure 5). 

 

Figure 5. Correlation for the TC content in mg.g

 assessed by HPLC, versus the yeast cells 
autofluorescence detected in the FL2 channel, determined from samples taken during the r assay 
I (section 4.2.1). 

This correlation was used to convert the autofluorescence readings of R. toruloides cells 

during the time course of the fed-batch cultivations, to determine TC content for all 

assays. 

 

4.2. Yeast fed-batch cultivations 

All assays were performed in a bench reactor, operated in fed-batch mode, with the 

objective of maximizing yeast cell growth and lipids and carotenoids accumulation. 

The conditions used are summarized in table 3.

Supply of solution NG began at t = 19.67 h, when the residual glucose concentration 

was low (2.01 g.L

) (Figure 6e). Solution G was added from t = 51.50 h onwards. 

The culture reached the stationary phase 51.00 h after inoculation, with a biomass 

concentration of 61.87 g L

 corresponding to 87 OD, and a biomass productivity of 1.20

 and 137 optical density (OD). The highest 

biomass productivity was reached at 50.00 h (1.58 gL

) with a biomass concentration 

of 79.76 g.L
-1

 (Figure 6a). 

During yeast growth, DO was maintained at values higher than 40% (Figure 6f) in order 

to avoid growth limitations due to oxygen deficiency. DO values decreased from 100% to 

close to 40%, when it rose again close to 87% due to depletion of the carbon source. 

During the addition of solution NG, DO dropped to values close to 50%, indicative of 

cellular metabolic activity. Once solution G was added, DO values remained around 

65%. During addition of solution G, there was an increase in TC and fatty acid 

production, although the TC content increase occurred later than the fatty acid content 

increase (Figures 6b and 6c). 

Stirring rate was maintained at 600 rpm throughout the trial (Figure 6f). 

Residual nitrogen levels decreased from 2.65 g.L
-1
 to values close to zero up to t = 20.00 

h and remained below 0.2 g.L
-1

 throughout the addition of solutions NG and G (t &gt; 19.67 

h) (Figure 6e). 

In this assay, the profile of residual glucose followed the same trend of the residual 

nitrogen profile, although the glucose concentration increased at the end of the test 

(Figure 6e) suggesting that, at the time, the metabolic activity of the cells diminished due 

to exhaustion of a nutrient other than nitrogen, as the cells maintain their activity when 

this nutrient is not present. The feed rates of the NG and G solutions were adjusted to 

maintain the residual glucose levels below 40 g.L
-1

 in order to avoid yeast growth 

inhibition by the substrate and, at the same time, avoiding the lack of carbon in the cells. 

Production of fatty acids followed the biomass profile, peaking at the beginning of the 

stationary phase and decreasing at the end of the test, at 167.00 h (Figure 6c). The 

maximum fatty acid percentage was obtained at 74.00 h corresponding to 27.57% (w/w) 

in relation to the dry cell weight. The maximum fatty acids productivity was obtained at 

74.00 h, with a value of 0.34 g.L
-1

.h
-1

, decreasing until the end of the experiment as a 

result of the decrease in the fatty acid content and biomass productivity during stationary 

phase (Figures 6a and 6c).

Carotenoids synthesis began during the stationary phase, when solution G was added to 

the culture (t = 51.50 h) supplying the carbon necessary for the production of storage 

materials, since the glucose medium was exhausted before this addition. TC content and 

productivity reached their maximums at t = 144.00 h with 0.28 mg.g

 and 0.191 mg.L

The dominant fatty acids were oleic (18:1?9), palmitic (16:0), linoleic (18:2?6) and 

stearic (18:0) acids. The proportions of these fatty acids are in the range of those 

published by Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) [78]  for the same yeast with the exception of 

palmitic acid (16:0), which presents with higher percentages (16:0: 13-16%; 18:0: 4-41% 

, 18:1?9: 18-42% and 18:2?6: 15-29%). 

At the end of the cultivation (t = 163.00 h), oleic acid (18:1?9) was in larger quantity with 

31.48% of the total fatty acid content, followed by linoleic (18:2?6), palmitic (16:0) and 

stearic (18:0), with values of 27.48%, 26.40% and 6.62%, respectively. After the addition 

of solution G (t = 51.50 h), the percentages of oleic acid (18:1?9), palmitic acid (16:0) 

and stearic acid (18:0) decreased slightly until the end of the experiment (from 34.33% 

to 31.48%, from 28.95% to 26.40% and from 8.45% to 6.62%, respectively), whereas the 

percentage of linoleic acid (18:2?6) increased from 21.59 % to 27.97%. 

Myristic acid (14:0) varied between 0 and 1.57% throughout the experiment and linolenic 

acid (18:3?3) between 4.32% and 11.41%. Palmitoleic acid (16:1?9) acid was detected 

in smaller quantities only at 74.00 h with a total content of 0.70%. 

According to the European standard EN 14214 (European Standard that describes the 

requirements and test methods for biodiesel) [79], due to linolenic (18:3?3)  acid’s 

propensity to oxidize [80] its presence is restricted to percentages below 12% and

maximum polyunsaturated fatty acids with four or more double bonds are limited to 1%. 

The results displayed in Figure 7 show that the R. toruloides fatty acid composition 

meets the European standard requirements. 

Figure 8 shows the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty 

acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) throughout this assay.

SFA are in greater proportion with a maximum at t = 74.00 h corresponding to 39.68%, 

followed by MUFA with a maximum at t = 19.00 h corresponding to 35.99%, and finally 

the PUFA, with a maximum at t = 26.00 h corresponding to 35.17%. 

SFA increased during the addition of solution NG (from 30.61% to 39.11%), continuing 

to rise during the addition of solution G up to 74 h, and then decreasing until the end of 

the test (34.30%).  

PUFA have the opposite behavior of SFA, decreasing during the addition of solution NG 

(from 33.40% to 25.32%) and increased during the addition of solution G to the end of 

the test (34.21%). 

MUFA remain approximately constant during the addition of solution NG (ranging from 

35.99% to 35.57%), decreasing during the addition of solution G to the end of the trial 

(31.48%).  

At the end of the assay, percentages are close to each other (34.30% for SFA, 31.48% 

for MUFA and 34.21% for PUFA).

4.2.2. Assay II 

Contrary to the works published by Pan et al. (1986) [69], parallel studies within our 

project concluded that the optimum pH for R. toruloides biomass production is 4.0 and 

not 5.5 (unpublished results). 

We therefore carried out this second assay at pH 4.0 with the aim of increasing R. 

toruloides biomass productivity since this is closely related to the products productivity in 

the study. The other conditions were the same as the previous assay. 

Figure 9 shows the profiles of the biomass concentration, OD, biomass productivity, the 

natural logarithm of the biomass, DO, stirring rate, residual glucose and nitrogen 

concentrations, fatty acid percentage and productivity, TC concentration and productivity 

for this assay.

The addition of solution NG extended the yeast’s active growth phase, with a specific 

growth rate of 0.05 h
-1

 (R
2
 = 0.98) for the NG addition phase (Figure 9d). 

Addition of NG solution to the bioreactor started at 20.08 h when residual glucose 

concentration levels were low (5.62 g.L
-1

) (Figure 9e). Solution G was added to the 

bioreactor at t = 52.58 h. 

The culture entered the stationary phase at t = 52.50 h with a biomass concentration of 

69.64 g.L
-1

 corresponding to 98 OD and a biomass productivity of 1.31 g.L
-1

.h

 (Figure

The maximum biomass concentration was 119.61 g.L
-1

 at t = 96.5 h with a biomass 

productivity of 1.23 g.L

.h
-1

 and 168.8 OD (Figure 9a). 

The maximum biomass productivity was reached at t = 47.00 h (1.76 g.L
-1

.h
-1

) with a 

biomass concentration of 83.48 g.L
-1

 (Figure 9a). 

As expected, changing the pH to 4.0 resulted in a maximum biomass concentration 

increase to 119.61 g.L
-1

. This increase in biomass concentration resulted in an increased 

oxygen consumption, with levels initially dropping from 100% to values close to 0.5%, 

when it began to rise again to a value near 79% due to the depletion of the carbon 

source (Figure 9f). During the addition of solution NG, DO values decreased to 23% (t = 

52.58 h) indicating cellular metabolic activity. After addition of solution G, DO values 

continued to decrease until it remained in the 1-4% range (Figure 9f). 

The stirring rate was maintained at 600 rpm until t = 45.50 h, when the DO level was 

21% (Figure 9f). From this point onward, the air flow was increased to 3 L.min
-1 

and
 
the 

bioreactor was set to an automatic input so that the stirring rate would automatically 

increase whenever DO values decreased below 40%, in order to keep the percentage 

above this threshold, to prevent oxygen limitation. From t = 79 h, the stirring rate 

remained at 1400 rpm until the end of the trial. Unfortunately, DO levels kept decreasing 

and stabilized at a very low percentage, thus unable to ensure oxygen sufficient 

conditions to the yeast cells, as it can be seen in figure 9f. 

Residual nitrogen levels decreased from 2.43 g.L
-1

 to 1.03 g.L
-1

 up to t = 20.00 h, 

decreasing throughout the addition of solution NG and increasing slightly until t = 51 h 

(0.98 g.L
-1

), right at the end of the addition of solution NG. Residual nitrogen 

concentration decreased once more after adding solution G and remained below 0.5 g.L
-

1
 during the entire assay with the exception of t = 94 h with a nitrogen concentration of 

0.72 g.L
-1

 (Figure 9e). 



 

27 
 

Residual glucose levels decreased from 56.33 g.L
-1

 to 5.62 g.L
-1

 during the batch phase 

(Figure 9e). During the addition of solution NG, from t = 23 h to t = 43 h, glucose 

concentration remained in the 2.16-2.72 g.L
-1
 range after which the peristaltic pump rate 

was increased resulting in increasing glucose concentration levels, reaching 7.17 g.L
-1

 at 

the end of solution NG addition (Figure 9e). After switching to solution G, concentration 

levels increased steadily and the pump rate was decreased to 0.4 rpm at t = 67.75 h and 

to 0.2 rpm shortly after (t = 70 h) (not shown)  to prevent glucose concentration from 

exceeding 40 g.L
-1 

and consequential substrate inhibition.  

However, residual glucose concentration exceeded 40 g.L
-1

 after t = 66.75 h and at the 

end of the assay (Figure 9e). This can be attributed to the fact that the peristaltic pump 

feed rate should have been set at a lower speed rate than 0.3 rpm from 94 h onwards, in 

order to prevent glucose accumulation in the medium thus substrate growth inhibition. 

This factor, coupled with the lack of oxygen during the remaining hours of the assay 

(Figure 9f) and suspicions that the glucose test strips stopped giving accurate qualitative 

estimates up to a certain concentration, resulted in the accumulation of glucose in the 

culture medium above the desired values. 

The accumulation of fatty acids follows the same profile of biomass concentration up to 

the stationary phase (Figures 9a and 9c) and slightly increased during the addition of 

solution G. The maximum total fatty acid content in the stationary phase was obtained at 

t = 117.67 h corresponding to 26.19% relative to the biomass (Figure 9c). The highest 

fatty acid productivity was obtained at t = 96.5 h corresponding to 0.32 g L
-1

.h
-1

. While 

the total fatty acid content remained stable until the end of the assay (25-26%) fatty acid 

productivity decreased along with biomass productivity (Figures 9a and 9c). 

As in the previous assay, carotenoids began to be accumulated when solution G was 

added to the culture during the stationary phase (t = 52.58 h) (Figure 9b). TC content 

increased throughout the cultivation, especially during the stationary phase, peaking at 

the end of the test with 0.15 mg.g
-1

.

Oleic (18:1?9), palmitic (16:0) and linoleic (18:2?6) acids were dominant. 

The percentages of oleic acid (18:1?9) are in the range of those published by 

Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) [78] for R. toruloides (18:1?9: 18-42%). As in assay I, the 

proportion of palmitic acid (16:0) was higher than the values reported by these authors 

(16:0: 13-16%). Linoleic acid (18:2?6) percentages are in the range of published values 

(18:2?6: 15-29%) with the exception of t = 19.00 h and t = 26.00 h, with slightly higher 

percentages. 

At the end of the assay (t = 118.5 h), oleic acid (18: 1?9) presented a higher percentage 

(31.48%) of total fatty acids, followed by linoleic (18: 2?6) and palmitic (16:0) acids with 

27.65% and 26.82%, respectively. 

The percentages of oleic (18:1?9) and palmitic acid (16:0) increased until the addition of 

the solution G (t = 52.58 h), from 31.07% to 36.13% and 18.72% to 29.19%, 

respectively. After addition of solution G, the proportion of both fatty acids decreased by 

the end of the test (t = 118.5 h) to 31.48% and 26.82%, respectively. 

Linoleic (18: 2?6) and linolenic acid (18:3?3) showed the opposite profile, decreasing 

during the addition of solution NG (from 31.88% to 20.56% and 14.31% to 4.33%, 

respectively) and then increased until the end of the assay (to 27.65% and to 5.45%, 

respectively). 

Stearic acid (18:0) was detected with percentages lower than 10%, increasing from 

4.02% to 8.27% until the addition of solution G. After the addition, the proportion of 

stearic acid (18:0) decreased reaching values lower than 1% and was not detected at 

the end of the assay. The percentages of stearic acid (18:0) are in the range of values 

published values Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) before adding solution G. After addition, the

acid can be found with lower values than those reported by these authors (18: 0: 4-

41%). 

Myristic acid (14:0) and palmitoleic acid (16:1?9) reached 1.52% and 7.91%, 

respectively, at t = 67.67 h, values which are not present in yeast biomass obtained 

during assay I at pH 5.5 and are in accordance with Jeenor et al. (2006) [81] who state 

that oxygen limited conditions modifies the activity of elongases, enzymes involved in 

the synthesis of long chain fatty acids..  

Linolenic acid (18: 3?3) percentage was below 12%, except at t = 19.00 h with 14.31%. 

No polyunsaturated fatty acids with four or more double bonds were detected. Therefore, 

the yeast biomass fatty acids profile for this assay fulfills the European standard 

requirements. 

Figure 11 shows the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty 

acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) throughout this assay.

At the end of the assay, MUFA present the highest percentage (38.81%), followed by 

PUFA and SFA with 33.10% 28.09%, respectively. MUFA have a maximum at t = 67.75 

h with 42.59%, PUFA at t = 19.00 h with 46.19% and SFA at t = 49.50 h corresponding 

to 38.98%. 

MUFA ranged between 31.07% and 42.59% throughout the assay, increasing from 

29.29% to 36.13% during the addition of solution NG. MUFA continued to increase 

during the addition of solution G until t = 67.75 h (42.59%), decreasing to the end of the 

assay (38.81%). 

SFA ranged between 22.74% and 38.98% throughout the test, increasing during the

24.89%) and increasing until the end of the experiment to 33.10%. 

 

4.2.3. Assay III 

Despite problems from oxygen deprivation, the results from assay II confirmed that the 

optimum pH for the production of yeast biomass is 4.0. The same parallel studies that 

led to this conclusion also revealed that the optimum pH for carotenoids and fatty acids 

production by R.toruloides is 5.0 (unpublished results).  

In this assay, we used the same system and feeding strategy used in assays I and II. 

In this assay, we adjusted the pH to 4.0 during the yeast’s growth phase and, once the 

culture reached the stationary phase, at which growth cell division slows down, we 

adjusted the pH of the culture medium to 5.0 to promote the accumulation of lipidic 

storage products such as carotenoids. In this assay we set the speed rate depending on 

the DO readings, so that above the threshold of 40% DO the speed rate increased in 

order to increase the kLa (volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient) thus the oxygen 

availability in the system. The air inflow was also increased.  

Figure 12 shows the profiles of the biomass concentration, OD, biomass productivity, the 

natural logarithm of the biomass, DO, stirring rate, residual glucose and nitrogen 

concentrations, fatty acid percentage and productivity, TC concentration and productivity 

for this assay.

The addition of solution NG extended the yeast’s active growth phase, with a specific 

growth rate of 0.05 h
-1

 (R
2
 = 0.93) for the NG addition phase (Figure 12d). 

Addition of solution NG began at 19.5 h when residual glucose concentration levels were 

low (1.23 g.L
-1

) (Figure 12e). Solution G was added to the bioreactor at t = 49.5 h. The 

pH was changed from 4.0 to 5.0 at t = 92 h. 

The culture entered the stationary phase at t = 64 h with a biomass concentration of 102 

g.L

 corresponding to 144.5 OD and a biomass productivity of 1.59 gL
-1

.h

 (Figure 12a). 

The maximum biomass concentration was 128.26 g.L

 at t = 159 h with a biomass yield 

of 0.80 g.L

.h
-1

 and 181 OD (Figure 12a). 

The maximum biomass productivity was reached at t = 44.00 h (1.94 g.L
-1

.h
-1

) with a 

biomass concentration of 86.06 g.L
-1

 (Figure 12a). 

The glucose added to the pre-inoculum was consumed as shown by the DO profile 

dropping from 100% to levels close to zero then increasing to 86.25% right before 

adding solution NG (Figure 12f). Feeding the bioreactor with solution NG (from t = 19.5 

to t = 46.5 h) decreased DO levels once again due to yeast cells’ metabolic activity. 

From t = 46.5 h to the end of the assay, the same problem from the previous assay 

occurred, with oxygen levels dropping and staying below 40% (Figure 12f).  

Residual nitrogen levels decreased from 2.34 g.L
-1

 to 0.89 g.L
-1

 up to t = 20.00 h, 

decreasing throughout the addition of NG and G solutions until t = 67.5 h when it started 

to increase until t = 164 h to 0.60 g.L
-1

 (Figure 12e). This increase was due to inaccurate 

ammonia titrations when determining residual nitrogen. 

Residual glucose levels decreased from 66.81 g.L
-1

 to 1.23 g.L
-1

 during the batch phase, 

remaining in the 1.23-3.69 g.L
-1

 range from t = 20 h to t = 46.5 h (Figure 12e). When 

solution G was added, the residual glucose concentration attained 40 g.L
-1

 at t = 67.5 h. 

At this time, the pump speed rate was decreased to 0.3 rpm, after which residual 

glucose concentration decreased to 18.48 g.L
-1
 at t = 70.5 h, increasing again to a 

concentration level close to 40 g.L
-1

 (35.70 g.L
-1
) at t = 87 h. Decreasing the pump’s 

speed rate to 0.2 rpm (not shown) managed to keep residual glucose concentration 



 

32 
 

below 40 g.L
-1 

until the end of the cultivation (Figure 12e). It is worth noting that at t = 92 

h, when the pH in the bioreactor was changed to 5.0, glucose levels decreased. When 

analyzing figure 12b, one can see that even though carotenoid accumulation began after 

supplying the yeast cells with the concentrated glucose solution, it increased even 

further after the pH changed, reaching a peak at t = 159.5 h with 0.18 mg.g

value was higher than the previous assay, the same as observed with the maximum

 at t = 120 h). Fatty acids also show an increase 

after the pH change, reaching a peak at t = 183 h with 27.88%. Although fatty acid 

productivity was lower (0.29 g.L

h

) than in assay II, the maximum productivity in this 

assay was reached earlier and also after the pH change (t = 93.50 h). The 

aforementioned results are consistent with our conclusions that pH 5.0 is the optimum 

value for the production of carotenoids and fatty acids. 

Figure 13 shows the fatty acids composition obtained during this assay.

Like in the two previous assays, oleic (18:1?9), palmitic (16:0) and linoleic (18:2?6) 

acids were the most prevalent fatty acids. 

Once again, oleic acid (18:1?9) presents percentages consistent with those published 

by Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) [78] for R. toruloides (18:1?9: 18-42%). As in assay I and 

II, the proportion of palmitic acid (16:0) was higher than the values reported by these 

authors (16:0: 13-16%). Linoleic acid (18:2?6) percentages are in the range of published 

values (18:2?6: 15-29%) with the exception of t ? 159.5 h.

At the end of the assay (t = 184 h), linoleic acid (18:2?6) presented a higher percentage 

(32.29%) of total fatty acids, followed by oleic (18:1?9) and palmitic (16:0) with 29.61% 

and 24.24%, respectively. 

Oleic acid (18:1?9) percentage increased until the pump’s speed rate was adjusted to 

0.8 rpm (not shown), from 29.78% to 35.93%. 

Palmitic acid (16:0) increased until the addition of the concentrated glucose solution (t = 

49.5) from 21.69% to 29.00%. After supplying the culture medium with the concentrated 

glucose solution, the proportion of both fatty acids decreased to the end of the test (t = 

187 h). 

Linoleic (18:2?6) and linolenic acid (18:3?3) showed the opposite profile, decreasing 

during the addition of solution NG (from 29.05% to 20.33% and 11.89% to 4.90%, 

respectively) and increased until the end of the assay (to 32.29% and to 6.52%, 

respectively). 

The percentages of stearic acid (18:0) remain somewhat stable throughout the whole 

assay and are in the range of values published by Sawangkeaw et al. (2013) [78]. 

Palmitoleic acid (16:1?9) was not detected in this assay. 

Linolenic acid (18:3?3) stayed below 12% and no polyunsaturated fatty acids with four 

or more double bonds were detected, therefore  R. toruloides fatty acids for this assay 

also fulfill the European standard requirements. 

Figure 14 shows the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty 

acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) for this assay.

SFA and MUFA show very similar patterns and close percentages, both increasing 

during the addition of solution NG (with the exception of MUFA from t = 40 h to t = 46.5 

h) and decreasing during the addition of the concentrated glucose solution (with the 

exception of MUFA from t = 46.5 h to t = 64 h) until the end of the assay. 

Just as in the previous assay, PUFA decreased during the addition of solution NG (from 

40.95% to 25.23%) and increasing until the end of the assay to 38.82%. 

 

4.2.4. Assay IV 

The same strategy from the previous assay was used. The only changes made were the 

use of a second impeller to the bioreactor’s rotor shaft and increasing air supply even 

further (5 L.h
-1

), in order to avoid limiting yeast growth and reserve products 

accumulation due to oxygen deficiency.

productivity, the natural logarithm of the biomass, DO, stirring rate, residual glucose and

The specific growth rate for the NG addition phase was 0.05 h

 (R

Addition of solution NG began at t = 15 h and solution G was added to the bioreactor at t

increased to 5 L.h

oscillating during the addition of NG and G solutions until the pH was changed to 5.0 

when it started to increase and oscillating again at the end of the assay (Figure 14e). 

Once more, this increase was due to inaccurate ammonia titrations when determining 

residual nitrogen.  

Residual glucose levels decreased from 58.54 g.L

 during the batch phase 

(Figure 14e). At the end of solution NG addition period, levels started rising until the pH 

change indicating that the culture reached the stationary phase. Then it decreased until t 

= 113 h increasing afterwards until the end of the assay when it reached levels close to 

40 g.L

(Figure 14e). 

The use of two Rushton impellers gave positive results. Although DO readings reached 

percentages below 40% from t = 81.84 h to t = 97 h and t ? 161.55 h, the overall 

percentages were much higher and were maintained for much longer periods when 

compared to the previous assays (Figure 14f). The effects of a higher oxygen availability

Once more, oleic (18:1?9), palmitic (16:0) and linoleic (18:2?6) acids were dominant. 

Oleic acid (18:1?9) percentages are in the range published by Sawangkeaw et al. 

(2013) [78] for R. toruloides (18:1?9: 18-42%). Palmitic acid (16:0) percentages are 

above the range given by these authors (16:0: 13-16%). Linoleic acid (18:2?6) 

percentages are in the range of published values (18:2?6: 15-29%) with the exception of 

t ? 160 h. Stearic acid (18:0) percentages are in the range of published values. 

At the end of the assay (t = 255 h), linoleic acid (18:2?6) represented the majority of 

total fatty acids with 36.89%, followed by oleic (18:1?9) and palmitic (16:0) acids with 

27.65% and 22.21%, respectively. 

Oleic acid (18:1?9) percentage increased until t = 63 h, from 30% to 35.76%, then 

decreasing up to t = 255 h to 27.65%. 

Palmitic acid (16:0) increased until t = 39 h from 20.66% to 29.28%, decreasing 

afterwards until the end of the assay to 22.21%. 

Linoleic (18:2?6) increased slightly up to t = 20 h (from 28.44% to 30%) and then 

showed the same profile as linolenic acid (18:3?3), decreasing during the addition of 

solution NG (from 30% to 20.61% and 14.66% to 4.50%, respectively) and increasing 

until the end of the assay (to 36.89% and to 6.98%, respectively). 

Palmitoleic (16:1?9) and myristoleic (14:1) acids were both detected in this assay at t = 

113 h with very low percentages (0.49% and 0.52%, respectively). 

With the exception of t = 15 h, linolenic acid (18:3?3) remained below 12% and no 

polyunsaturated fatty acids with four or more double bonds were detected, therefore the

PUFA show the highest percentage (43.87%). SFA and MUFA show proximate 

percentages, with 28.48% and 26.65%, respectively. PUFA have a maximum at t = 15 h 

with 43.11%, MUFA at t = 63 h with 35.76% and SFA at t = 45.5 h with 39.76%. 

SFA and MUFA both increased during the addition of solution NG (from 26.33% to 

39.74% and from 30.57% to 35.13%, respectively) and decreased during the addition of 

the solution G until the end of the assay. PUFA decreased during the addition of solution 

NG (from 43.11% to 25.11%) and increased until the end of the assay.

When comparing the parameters calculated for all four assays, one can conclude that 

there are two important factors influencing these values: oxygen availability and medium 

pH.  

The pH used in assay II resulted in a 23.08% increase in the maximum biomass 

concentration and a 10.23% increase in maximum biomass productivity compared to 

assay I. The maximum biomass concentration obtained for assay II, as well as in assays 

III and IV, were higher than the concentration reported by Li et al. (2007) (106.5 g.L
-1

) 

using Rhodosporidium toruloides Y4 grown in 15 L bioreactors in fed-batch cultivations 

with glucose as the carbon source [82].  

Fatty acid and total lipid percentages and carotenoid concentration in assay II were 

lower than in assay I. The lack of oxygen in the culture may explain this reduction 

compared to the previous trial. However, even with this limitation, the maximum fatty 

acid concentration in assay II was higher than the previous assay, possibly due to higher 

biomass productivity, which is tightly related to fatty acid synthesis [54]. 

The results in assay IV, due to a more efficient oxygen distribution to the culture, are in 

agreement with those from Saenge et al. (2011b) who reported a significant increase in 

the biomass concentration and lipid production and a slight increase of carotenoid 

production after increasing the aeration rate in Rhodotorula glutinis fed-batch cultures 

[83]. Other authors have also reported the positive effects of aeration on carotenoid 

content [84-86]. 

However, carotenoid values for assay IV were relatively low compared to the results 

obtained by Saenge et al. (2011a; 2011b) [32, 83]. In contrast, the total lipid 

concentration values obtained by these authors were much lower than the results 

obtained in all assays. Observing the decrease of the maximum fatty acid percentage 

and fatty acid concentration in assay IV, it might suggest that fatty acid and carotenoid 

production are inverse to one another. This can be explained by the fact that fatty acids 

are, as previously mentioned, a product uniquely associated with the yeast’s growth [54] 

while carotenoids are a mixed product (associated with the growth and also produced in 

the stationary phase, as reserves) [54, 87]. 

Assays I and IV show higher fatty acid productivity than the productivity obtained by 

Zhao et al. (2011) [88] for a fed-batch system with intermittent 30 g.L
-1

 glucose feed 

(0.36 g.L
-1

.h
-1

). The fatty acid productivity obtained in assay IV was higher than the value 

reported by the same authors but with continuous 30 g.L
-1

 glucose feed (0.39 g.L
-1

.h
-1

). 

Total lipid content in the biomass for all assays was lower than the percentages given by 

Wiebe et al. (2012) [89] when using glucose (48 - 75%) in their nitrogen restricted 

medium used to cultivate Rhodosporidium toruloides in batch and fed-batch cultures in 

0.5 L bioreactors at pH 4. With the exception of assay II, total lipid content of yeast 



 

40 
 

biomass for the other assays are in the range of those observed by Wiebe et al. (2012) 

when using xylose as the carbon source (36 - 45%), and higher than the percentages 

obtained when using arabinose (15 - 19%) [89]. 

All assays presented fatty acid compositions fulfilling EN 14214 requirements (with the 

exception of t = 19 h in assay II and t = 15 h in assay IV, with 18:3?3 percentages above 

12%). 

Low amounts of PUFA and SFA are required to ensure good quality biodiesel with 

satisfactory properties [90], therefore the fatty acid composition from assay II is the one 

that guarantees the best biodiesel properties due to its high MUFA content. The higher 

levels of PUFA in R. toruloides oil found in assay IV gives its biodiesel lower oxidative 

stability [32]. However, this is not impeditive to obtain a good quality biodiesel if 

associated with other oils [91]. 

 

4.4. Flow Cytometry 

In this study we used FC to detect cell viability during the development of all cultivations. 

This technique also allowed us to quantify the TC content produced by R. toruloides 

(Section 3.8.2.) and monitor cell viability by detecting the integrity of the cytoplasmic 

membrane and mitochondrial membrane potential (Section 3.8.1.), in real time. Previous 

subpopulation controls were performed by Freitas et al. (2014) for R. toruloides [54] 

(Annex II). 

Figures 18 to 21 show the sub-populations profiles obtained from the density plots of R. 

toruloides cells double-stained with DiOC6(3) and PI, harvested during assays I – IV, in 

different physiological states.

Generally, all assays show an increase in depolarized cells during the batch phase. This 

increase is attributed to cell stress induced by starvation from the yeast cells’ metabolic 

activity when consuming the glucose present in the pre-cultures at the end of the batch 

phase. 

Particularly in assay I, at the end of the batch phase, the proportion of intact cells with 

polarized membranes reached 65%, and the proportion of cells with intact and 

depolarized membranes was 35% (Figure 17). When solution NG was added, the 

proportion of intact cells with polarized membranes increased and stabilized at values 

close to 88 % during the G solution feeding period. Intact cells with depolarized 

membranes remained at around 6% (Figure 17) during the addition of the concentrated 

glucose solution while cells with permeabilized membranes stayed at very low 

percentages throughout the whole assay.  

Assay II displays the highest percentage of stressed cells and the lowest proportion of 

intact and polarized cells compared to other assays. The sharp drop in the polarized 

cells proportion and the simultaneous increase in the depolarized cells proportion at t = 

44 h (Figure 18) was coincident with the drop in DO and glucose concentration during 

this assay (Figure 18). 

Assay III presents 49.6% of permeabilized cells at the end of the batch period. The 

percentage of intact cells with depolarized membrane increased after switching to the 

concentrated glucose solution, ranging between 12-13.0% until the end of this assay, 

while the proportion of normal cells remained at about 83% during the feeding period 

(Figure 19). 

Once again, the effects of aeration in assay IV can be seen when looking at the profiles 

displayed in figure 20, showing the highest percentage of intact and polarized cells out of 

all assays. In contrast, cells with depolarized membrane and permeabilized membrane 

remained at very low percentages, the former never exceeding 13% while the latter 

always remained below 6%. 

 

5. Conclusions and future prospects 

This work’s aim was to implement a suitable strategy for the improvement of lipids and 

carotenoids production by the red yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 grown in 

a fed-batch bench 7L-reactor under various conditions.  

Working with a medium pH of 4 gave the highest biomass concentration and biomass 

productivity compared to our first assay with a medium pH of 5.5. However, as a result of 

selecting the most suitable pH for high density growth, the production of storage 

materials was diminished. Failure to predict how much the dissolved oxygen in the 



 

43 
 

medium would decrease at the time, due to increased cell growth, also contributed to the 

poor results in this assay, due to oxygen limiting conditions. 

Changing the pH medium from 4 to 5 during the stationary phase was successful, as 

biomass, lipid and carotenoid productivities increased. Still, it was not until we provided 

more efficient aeration that we observed oxygen was indeed fundamental during the 

yeast cultivation, giving the highest productivities out of all assays.  

FC proved to be an useful tool for monitoring yeast cells near real time, giving us instant 

quantification of TC as well as observe their physiological states as the cultivation 

conditions in the bioreactor changed, allowing us to immediately control the entire 

process to best suit the yeast’s needs to ensure the best results. This would have not 

been possible if we had used time consuming traditional microbiological techniques that 

would have only given results long after the entire process had ended.  

Using FC, we found that mitochondrial activity and integrity of the cytoplasmic 

membrane of R. toruloides cells are affected by lack of nutrients and oxygen. 

Having already found a way to improve lipids and carotenoids production, the next step 

in our work will focus on the process optimization. It is expected that the scale-up step 

using low-cost industrial by-products such as carob pulp syrup as a carbon source 

(using a 35 L reactor) will make the process more cost-efficient.

Annex II – Cell viability controls 
 
Figure A2 shows the flow cytometric controls for R. toruloides subpopulation 

identification. 

 
 

 

These controls allowed us to identify R. toruloides physiological states throughout 

assays I, II, III and IV. 

 

 

 

Figure A2. Flow cytometric controls for R. toruloides cells stained with PI and DiOC6(3). Density 
plot (I) represent yeast cells grown under nutrient excess and density plot (II) stands for stressed 
cells due to starvation. Gray squares correspond to yeast cells stained with PI. Subpopulation A 
[DiOC6(3)

-
 PI

-
] corresponds to cells with intact cytoplasmic membrane, but with depolarized 

mitochondrial membrane; Subpopulation B [DiOC6(3)
+
 PI

-
] corresponds to cells with an intact 

cytoplasmic membrane and polarized mitochondrial membrane; subpopulation C [DiOC6(3)
+
 PI

+
]  

shows the permeabilized yeast cells.(Adapted from Freitas et al. (2014) [54])
