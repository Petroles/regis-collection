agradecimentos 

 
First and foremost I want to thank the FAME program for the opportunity of 
studying and obtaining a degree abroad and huge acknowledgment is given to 
Prof. Ana Barros for the coordination at Universidade de Aveiro. Furthermore, I 
express my gratitude to Prof. João Rocha for the supervision of this Master thesis 
project, but more importantly, for being my mentor. His open-door policy always 
let me feel welcomed for a talk in his office. His, commitment and down-to-earth 
mentality are admirable and something from which everyone can take an 
example. Moreover, I acknowledge Prof. Rui Silva and Dr. Felipe Almeida Paz 
for working in their laboratories and their helpful advice. Furthermore and in 
particular, I want to thank Dr. Ricardo Silva for his enormous contribution to this 
work in all the technical and experimental aspects. I could always count on his 
practical experience with the ALD reactor and his wise instructions. I highly 
appreciated the pleasant and encouraging working atmosphere with him every 
day. Moreover, great acknowledgement has to be given to the support in the 
great amount of characterization methods by Ana Violeta Girão, Rosário Soares, 
Maria Celeste Azevedo and Sara Fateixa. I want to thank all of the 
aforementioned persons for the fruitful discussions and suggestions. Without 
their help and advice, this work could not have been realized. I could profit from 
all of them during my learning process as a Master student. Finally, I want to 
thank all my friends who made my year abroad in Portugal an unforgettable 
experience. Wherever my future path will bring me, I will rest with good memories 
for the time in Aveiro. Last but not least, I could always trust in the support from 
my family back home. Thank you.

resumo 
 

 

A técnica de deposição por camada atómica (ALD) permite a deposição de 
filmes finos em fase de vapor de alta qualidade com um controlo de espessura 
à nano-escala. No presente trabalho foi demonstrado a deposição de filmes finos 
de óxido de zinco (ZnO) por ALD de elevada uniformidade em diferentes 
substratos, incluído nano-estruturas como por exemplo, nanotubos de carbono. 
Demonstrou-se por difracção de raio-X que o processo de deposição do ZnO 
originou a formação da estrutura da hexagonal, na fase wurtzite, com uma taxa 
de crescimento por ciclo de 1.9 Å. A deposição de filmes finos de natureza 
inorgânica (e.g. óxidos metálicos) por ALD está bem estabelecida 
contrariamente à emergente deposição por camada molecular (MLD) de filmes 
finos puramente orgânicos. Actualmente, a combinação de ALD/MLD começa a 
ganhar importância na criação de estruturas híbridas do tipo orgânica-
inorgânicas. Nomeadamente, através da selecção adequada dos precursores, é 
possível obter diferentes arquitecturas funcionais em forma de filme fino, 
incluindo nano-laminados, superestruturas e redes metalo-orgânicas (MOFs) 
nano-porosas. A deposição de MOFs por ALD/MLD surge como uma alternativa 
para superar as desvantagens dos métodos convencionais de deposição de 
filmes finos baseados em soluções. Este trabalho contempla também a revisão 
da literatura no que diz respeito à síntese de este tipo de filmes finos obtidos em 
fase de vapor. Procedeu-se à reprodução dos resultados da literatura tendo 
como objectivo a síntese de filmes finos híbridos orgânico-inorgânicos 
(e.g. MOFs). Numa primeira fase efectuou-se a transformação vapor-sólido de 
um filme de ZnO crescido por ALD por exposição ao vapor de 2-metilimidazol. 
Posteriormente usou-se um processo ALD/MLD com o propósito de depositar 
uma estrutura do tipo zeólito (ZIF-8) a partir da reacção do dietilzinco (DEZ) e o 
2-metilimidazol. Finalmente realizou-se a síntese de dois sistemas de filmes 
finos híbridos com base no ácido tereftálico como precursor orgânico e os 
seguintes precursores organometálicos: DEZ e Eu(TMHD)3. Para o caso do 
sistema DEZ/TPA, a formação da ligação Zn-TP nos filmes híbridos, foi 
observada por espectroscopia de FTIR.

abstract 

 
Atomic layer deposition is a state-of-the-art vapor phase deposition method for 
the creation of high quality thin films with nanoscale thickness control. As 
demonstrated in this work by the deposition of ZnO with a home-built reactor, 
ALD enables uniform and conformal film deposition even on complex 
nanostructures like carbon nanotubes. Deposition of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO 
proven by GIXRD with a growth-per-cycle of 1.9 Å, determined from XRR 
thickness measurements, was demonstrated. While the ALD synthesis of 
inorganic thin films, such as metal oxides is widely established, the organic 
counterpart molecular layer deposition (MLD) is still emerging. Recently, 
combining ALD/MLD has attracted great interest for the creation of organic-
inorganic hybrid structures. By choice and adaptation of suitable precursors a 
great versatility of functional thin film architectures is achievable, spanning from 
novel multilayer nanolaminates and superstructures for thermoelectrics, over 
luminescent lanthanide hybrid films for optical application to even crystalline, 

nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as low-? dielectrics in 
microdevices. Especially in the field of MOFs, a clean and precise synthesis route 
by ALD/MLD is desirable for device implementation in order to overcome the 
drawbacks of conventional, solution-based thin film deposition techniques. In this 
work, recent advances towards these vapor-processed hybrids are reviewed. 
Then, the reproduction of literature results leading to the deposition of organic-
inorganic hybrid thin films (e.g. MOFs) was studied. The feasibility of a vapor-
solid transformation of a sacrificial ALD-grown ZnO film by exposure to 2-
methylimidazole (HMIM) and a direct ALD/MLD method using HMIM and 
diethylzinc (DEZ) towards a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) have been 
attempted. Finally, the synthesis of two different hybrid films was studied 
involving the organic precursor terephthalic acid (TPA) combined with the 
organometallic precursors DEZ or Eu(TMHD)3. In case of the DEZ/TPA system, 
the deposition of a hybrid thin film with Zn-terephthalate bondings was evidenced 
by FTIR spectroscopy.

INTRODUCTION 1 

1 Introduction 

Since the beginning, mankind has explored new ways to exploit the synergistic effects of mixing 

different materials. The objective is to profit from enhanced properties or to wipe out undesired 

features.1 This concept is employed in modern composites like glass or carbon fiber reinforced 

polymers or cermets, which gain superior mechanical properties. In these examples different material 

classes (polymers, metals, ceramics etc.) are combined on a macroscopic level with a filler in a matrix 

material. This approach would be rather considered as materials engineering. In contrast, chemists 

have always dealt with molecules and have recently brought the concept of composites to a nanoscale 

(Figure 1). In the last few decades hybrid materials have become a rapidly growing trend and have 

revolutionized design possibilities to create novel material structures. Hybrid materials are composed 

of at least two components, usually an organic and inorganic component, that are molecularly 

dispersed.2 The birth of these hybrids is closely related to the development of Sol-gel processes in the 

1980s, which use the reaction of molecular precursors in a liquid phase to form bulk materials. This 

synthesis route has been an inspiring playground for material scientists and has, for instance, created 

the class of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with plenty of envisioned applications. As the 

miniaturization trend has caught wide fields of science, and has created a new field called 

“nanotechnology”, also the processing of these hybrid materials has been improved. Thin film 

deposition of hybrid materials is demanded by the microelectronics industry and is driven by the 

technological progress, for instance in vapor-phase deposition methods.

OBJECTIVES 3 

2 Objectives 

The main task of this Master project is to review recent advances in the thin film deposition of organic-

inorganic hybrids by Atomic and Molecular Layer Deposition (ALD/MLD) and to perform some 

experiments in this area. A special focus is given to an emerging class of porous hybrids, namely metal-

organic Frameworks (MOFs). The following chapter will give an introduction into ALD and MLD. 

The historic development and main features of these advanced thin film growth techniques including 

benefits and limitations will be summarized. Furthermore, MOFs will be introduced and discussed 

with regard to synthesis routes, challenges and potential applications. Subsequently, in an 

experimental part, an understanding of the ALD/MLD process was gained by working with a non-

commercial, home-built ALD reactor. In early stage experiments, experience about the ALD technique 

was gathered by deposition of purely inorganic ZnO by sequential use of the precursors H2O and 

diethylzinc (DEZ). These films were consecutively exposed to gaseous 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) 

targeting a vapor-solid transformation of the sacrificial ZnO into a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-

8). Feasibility of a direct ALD/MLD route towards this ZIF-8 was moreover studied. Finally, it has 

been attempted to reproduce some recent literature results concerning terephthalate hybrid thin films 

involving precursors, such as terephthalic acid (TPA), DEZ and the lanthanide containing 

Eu(TMHD)3. These first studies with the here used ALD/MLD reactor system explore thin film 

deposition of organic-inorganic hybrid structures on the road to vapor-based MOF synthesis.





 

ALD/MLD 5 

3 Atomic and Molecular Layer Deposition (ALD/MLD) 

The origins of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) date back to the early 1970s and were initiated by the 

works of Suntola et al., in Finland.4-7 The development was mainly driven by the microelectronics 

industry searching for solutions for depositing high-? dielectrics, such as metal oxides, namely in the 

field of electroluminescent flat panel displays (TFEL). The fact that a first EU patent in 1974 was 

followed by the first research paper in 1980 shows that the development of the ALD technique was 

application driven. ALD was referred as Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) in the early years. The great 

success of ALD is mirrored by the large increase of publication numbers shown in Figure 2. Since the 

breakthrough around 2000 the technique has become an established thin film vapor phase deposition 

method among others like for example Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Chemical Vapor 

Deposition (CVD). In the following years it has not just been exploited by microelectronics, but has 

been used as a mainstream technology in wide fields ranging from nano- to biotechnology.

The material range has been widely broadened in the 1990s (Figure 3) by the introduction of organic 

precursors for Molecular Layer Deposition (MLD). As shown in Figure 4 molecules are grown in a 

sequential layer-by-layer fashion. Recently, in the late 2000s the combined ALD/MLD deposition of 

organic-inorganic hybrid thin films has become popular.8 This opened various possibilities for fine-

tuning of thin film properties by creating hybrid mixtures, superstructures and nanolaminates (Figure 

5). Electronic, optical and mechanical properties, porosity, crystallinity degrees, surface roughness or 

refractive indices can be influenced by the choice and sequence of precursors. The book of Pinna and 

Knez7 and the reviews of George9, 10 give complete overviews about various aspects of inorganic ALD 

and its organic counterpart MLD. The paper of Sundberg and Karppinen8 especially provides a broad 

review of organic-inorganic hybrid thin films and a collection of used organic precursors. Moreover, 

van Bui reviews the novel application fields of combined ALD/MLD “off the beaten track”.11

Figure 4: An ALD/MLD cycle consisting of four steps: (1) the 
first pulsed (inorganic) precursor reacts with the surface species, 
(2) the excess precursor and possible byproducts are removed 
from the reactor, either by purging with inert gas, such as N2 or 
Ar, or by evacuation, (3) the second (organic) precursor is pulsed 
to the reactor and it reacts with the surface species, and finally 
(4) the excess precursor/possible byproducts are removed from 
the reactor. In an ideal case a monolayer of a hybrid inorganic–
organic material is formed. The cycle is repeated to reach a 
targeted film thickness. Taken from Sundberg and Karppinen.8

The main feature of ALD/MLD is the sequential and self-limiting deposition character at moderate 

temperatures that is fundamentally different from other vapor-based methods such as PVD, which is 

purely physical and does not involve reactions, or the continuous gas phase reaction of CVD. In 

ALD/MLD different gaseous precursors are injected into the reaction chamber in a cyclic manner 

including purging steps in between. In an ideal process at any time there is only one precursor species 

present in the chamber that fully saturates and reacts with the surface and there is no self-reaction of 

the precursors.  Step coverage of atomic or molecular layers and the self-terminated surface reaction 

are typical for ALD/MLD. Therefore, the growth of thin films and their thickness can be controlled 

on the nanoscale. 

 

The prototype ALD/MLD process uses at least two precursors, but in principle more precursors may 

be used for multicomponent or multilayer systems. The precursor requirements comprise high vapor 

pressure, which means high volatility at the deposition temperatures, in order to saturate the reaction 

chamber volume. Good thermal stability is needed in order to avoid decomposition before surface 

reaction. Organic precursors with stiff backbones in MLD can prevent multiple or bridging reactions. 

Chemisorption on the substrate and fast and complete reaction are necessary and may require a 

substrate surface preparation.  Potential by-products should not etch the surface. The choice of suitable 

precursors is indeed one of the most important factors for a working deposition process.7 

 



 

ALD/MLD 7 

The ideal, self-limiting growth affords sufficiently long precursor pulsing and purging steps. In 

practice, surface saturation in the pulsing steps is often only partially achieved. Therefore a growth 

rate for the average increase in film thickness during one growth cycle is introduced. This growth-

per-cycle value (GPC) is also an important measure with regard to the growth mode. If the GPC stays 

constant during the deposition cycles, the growth is linear. Especially in the beginning during the 

nucleation process, growth can be inhibited or enhanced by the chemical compatibility of the substrate 

surface leading to an initially increasing or decreasing GPC. The GPC is dependent on growth 

parameters, such as temperature, pressure or precursor pulsing time and flow as shown in Figure 6. 

For a linear process the growth parameters define a so called “ALD window” with constant GPC. 

Outside the window the GPC can be lower due to insufficient reactivity at low temperatures or 

precursor desorption at high temperatures; Or the GPC can be higher due to strong precursor 

condensation at low temperatures or precursor decomposition at high temperatures. The precursor 

pulse time can also influence the GPC. Too short pulse times may not be sufficient to saturate the 

surface. Too long pulsing time can also lead to precursor decomposition and increasing GPC or time 

can be given to etching reactions that decrease the GPC. However, a growth in the ALD window is 

not necessarily a prerequisite for a well-functioning process.8

from Pinna and Knez.7 

 

To summarize, the benefits of the ALD/MLD method are the nanoscale thickness control, uniformity 

of thin film composition, film conformality even on complex structures, high film quality without 

pinholes, large area capability and the vast possibilities for multilayer structures design. These features 

are highly interesting for nanodevices fabrication. The limitations are the low deposition rates 

compared to CVD or PVD due to the slow deposition in sequences with a distinct growth-per-cycle 

value in the range of only a few Ångstroms. The choice of well-behaving precursors together with a 

suitable substrate lead to limitations in the material selection. A lot of research is still needed in finding 

optimal combinations, in particular in combined ALD/MLD. Precursor specific limitations, like 



 

ALD/MLD 8 

agglomeration behaviour for metallic films (Cu, Pt, Au) or non-sharp interfaces with Si have to be 

considered in ALD. In particular in MLD, steric hindrances of long organic molecules can lead to 

imperfect growth for example. Encountered difficulties with organic precursors are discussed by 

George et al.,10 Reactive byproducts can etch the surface, precursors can decompose before reacting 

with the surface or precursor diffusion into the growing film might add a non-ideal, unwanted CVD 

character to the actually sequential ALD/MLD process.



 

MOFs 9 

4 Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) 

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly topical class of nanoporous, crystalline coordination 

networks held together by strong bonds.12-14 These frameworks contain interconnected polytopic 

organic linker molecules and metal-based nodes as schematically shown in Figure 7.  As a matter of 

fact, a new class of materials needs its own terminology and consequently many efforts were done for 

an exact classification. This included many controversial discussions between different scientific 

communities coming from different backgrounds.15 IUPAC categorizes MOFs as a subset of 

“coordination networks”, which are another subset of the most general term “coordination 

polymers”.16, 17 As a “coordination network” a MOF requires “repeating coordination entities in 1 

dimension with cross-links between two or more individual chains, loops or spiro-links, or a coordination 

compound extending through repeating coordination entities in 2 or 3 dimensions”.  However, in a more 

general scientific language MOFs are often related to the more fashionable, broadly used, but arguable 

term “organic-inorganic hybrid materials”. This definition emphasizes the fact that MOFs necessarily 

contain organic and inorganic moieties and highlights the contrast between covalent and ionocovalent 

bonds. Thus, a terminology distinction is drawn relatively to other porous materials like the purely 

inorganic zeolites or the purely covalent organic frameworks (COF).  

 

 

 

Figure 7: Schematic representation of a MOF formed by 

inorganic connection points (metal centers) and organic 

linker molecules. Organic coordination polymers offer 

large variability (length, shape, branching etc.) in 

isoreticular chemistry for designing the pore interior. 

Additionally, functionalized linkers can enable properties 

such as catalytic activity. Taken from Ma et al.19 

 

Figure 8: MOF structures (1D, 2D, and 3D) 

reported in the Cambridge Structural Database 

(CSD) from 1971 to 2011. The trend shows a 

striking increase for all structure types. In 

particular, the doubling time for the number of 3D 

MOFs (inset) is the highest among all reported 

MOF structures. Taken from Furukawa et al.14 

  

The connectivity between metal nodes and organic linkers follows various coordination geometries 

(tetrahedral, octahedral etc.) and leads to structures of different dimensionality (1D chains, 2D sheets, 

3D networks).18 For instance, this coordination chemistry is dependent on preferred coordination 

numbers and geometries of metal ions and the flexibility and (multi)functionality of the organic linkers. 



 

MOFs 10 

Furthermore, the synthesis conditions, such as temperature or pH and thermodynamic and kinetic 

factors play an important role in the formation of these frameworks. The assembly of repeatedly linked 

structures is controlled on purpose by combining building units and is referred as reticular chemistry. 

In the last years the MOF research has created a large variety of new structures as pictured in Figure 

8. This structural flexibility is due to the diverse combination and design possibilities of organic linkers 

and metal centers. Therefore, MOFs have a high chemical mutability for functionalization and 

potential for fine tuning structure-property relationships.  

In the IUPAC recommendations is stated that MOFs have to fulfil the criteria of “potential voids”, but 

do not require physical measurements of porosity per se.17 However, permanent porosity and the 

physical and chemical properties arising from it are a characteristic feature on which MOF research is 

mainly based on. Accordingly, IUPAC gives terminology recommendations for the classification of 

porous materials.20 Microporous materials contain pores below 2 nm, mesoporous materials contain 

pores between 2 and 50 nm and macroporous materials have pore sizes larger than 50 nm. Despite 

these recommendations, but naturally from a linguistic point of view, the term nanoporous is 

frequently used to classify MOFs as materials with nm-sized pores. The porosity as a main MOF 

attribute can be engineered due to reticular framework chemistry. Series of isoreticular frameworks of 

same topology with tuneable pore size are synthesized by variation of linker length or 

functionalization. One of the most prominent and influencing works in this field was presented by 

Eddaoudi et al., in 2002 for the prototypic MOF-5 as illustrated in Figure 9.21 Pore sizes from 

0.39 to 2.88 nm were reported for topologically similar frameworks. 

 

Figure 9: Single crystal X-ray structures of isoreticular series of the three-dimensional MOF-5 framework with 

tuneable pore sizes from 0.39 to 2.88 nm reported by Eddaouidi, O'Keeffe, Yaghi et al.21 This structural versatility 

is possible by use of several organic, carboxylic linkers (C: black, O: red) interconnecting the Zn-center that form 

coordination polyhedra (blue). Yellow spheres visualize the pore volume. Hydrogen atoms are omitted. 

 

Another prototypic class of MOF structures are zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) which are 

topologically similar to zeolites. ZIFs are composed of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal


 

MOFs 11 

like Fe, Co, Cu, Zn connected with imidazolate type linkers. Solvothermal synthesis of various ZIF 

structures were presented by Park et al., and exhibit permanent porosity combined with high thermal 

stability up to 550 °C and chemical resistance to boiling alkaline water and organic solvents.22 Among 

these frameworks the ZIF-8, which contains 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) linkers, is the most 

prominent and shows pore diameters of 1.16 nm and a theoretical specific surface area of 1947 m²/g 

based on calculations on the single crystal X-ray structure as illustrated in Figure 10.

framework structure is topologically similar to zeolites and formed by the illustrated building units. The three 

images show a stick model (left), a tiling model (center) and the framework structure containing HMIM linkers 

(C: black, N: green) and forming ZnN4 tetrahedra in blue (right). Yellow spheres visualize the pore volume. 

Hydrogen atoms are omitted. Taken from Park et al.22  

 

The pore interior is a unique property that allows for incorporation of molecules and makes MOFs 

ideal candidates for host-guest structures. In the beginning, MOF research focused mainly on 

application fields like catalysis, gas adsorption and storage or molecular separation.14, 23 Hence, for a 

long time the design of open structures and exceptionally high internal surface area and adsorption 

capacities was the driving force in the field. Furthermore, host-guest interactions can be realized due 

to the MOF porosity. In the review of Ricco et al., it is emphasized on biotechnological applications in 

drug release and delivery, biological sensing and imaging and highlights the use of MOFs as 

crystallization matrices.24 MOF matrices can be used as crystal hosts for structural analysis of 

nanogram quantities by X-ray diffraction (XRD), for macromolecule encapsulation, as protecting 

environment for enzyms in biocatalysis or for biomimetic mineralization.  

Two approaches are followed to tailor the functional properties of MOFs. Firstly, the structure-

property relation of the MOF framework itself can be adapted by choice of suitable metal nodes and 

linkers with desired features. As a good example, the multifunctional properties of lanthanide MOFs 

(LnMOFs) were emphasized in some highly cited papers stating out the porous, luminescent and

lanthanide ions act as metal centers with intense photoluminescence. By the antenna effect proper 

organic coordination ligands can improve the luminescent properties through optical excitation,

energy transfer from the ligand to the lanthanide centers and the final distinct, optical emission by the 

rare earth ions. Secondly, the host property of MOFs is exploited by adding guests with functional 

properties into the framework. For instance, Falcaro et al., review the integration of metal and metal-

oxide nanoparticles@MOFs.29 This enables and enhances a wide range of applications in sensing, 

plasmonics, pollutant sequestration, separation, fuel production or biomedical solutions. 

Based on the great versatility of MOFs the aforementioned trends in a variety of fields demonstrate 

the dynamic and fast developments of an emerging community. After a long research period on the 

traditional topics gas adsorption or catalysis, recently, research on MOF focuses also on electrical and 

ionic conduction, energy harvesting and emission or magnetic, dielectric and mechanical properties. 

This is justified by the great interest of the microelectronic industry to integrate organic-inorganic 

hybrid materials – and in particular MOFs - into microdevices, such as active sensor coatings, low- ? 

dielectrics or tuneable conductors.30 In the review of Stassen et al.,3 some case studies for MOFs in 

electronic devices like FETs or resistive memories are presented. In addition, applications of MOFs in 

mass sensitive, chemical and opto-electronic sensors are highlighted. A final SWOT analysis 

(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) assesses the value of MOFs for use in electronic devices. 

The challenge in this research field is finding an optimal route for thin film deposition that adequately 

fits the everlasting miniaturization trend.31 Thin film deposition methods have been widely studied for 

this reason, but mainly by solution based methods.32 Despite the promising properties and applicability 

of MOF thin films for various purposes mainly the paradigm of this solution-based synthesis methods 

for MOFs prevented device implementation up to now.3 Conventional chemical solution deposition 

(CSD), also referred as sol-gel methods, typically rely on the reaction of a metal salt precursor with a 

linker either at room temperature33 or under hydro- or solvothermal conditions at increased 

temperatures up to 220 °C as reviewed by Lee et al..34 Various precursors, reaction sequences, substrate 

pre-treatments and deposition conditions have been reported. The benefit of the simple, flexible and 

effective CSD approach is the cheap and easy implementation on the labscale. However, numerous 

drawbacks of this wet chemical practices have to be considered after Stassen et al.35 Especially surface-

tension-related phenomena like incomplete wetting or meniscus formation play an important role in 

liquid systems. Consequent substrate swelling or dissolution are main issues of wet chemistry 

approaches. Compared to vapor-based methods wet chemistry faces upscaling problems as the 

handling of larger solvent amounts creates more waste and therefore cost and sustainability concerns. 

Furthermore, working with large volumes of toxic solvents can be hazardous. Moreover, wet chemical 

methods are disadvantageous because of contamination risks. As CSD typically uses metal salts, 

containing for example nitrates or chlorides, reaction chambers are exposed to corrosion problems 

and, above all, sample impurities are not tolerable in electronic devices. The use of high purity solvents 

could address a cleaner process, but would be very costly. Surprisingly, up to now not much attention 

has been given to clean vapor-phase based methods in MOF synthesis.

5 Review of vapor-based MOF synthesis 

A long time MOF research focused on tuning chemical and physical bulk properties for fields like gas 

adsorption or catalysis. Due to great versatility and developments in MOF synthesis, recently, novel 

application fields in the microelectronic industry become interesting. The aforementioned drawbacks 

of conventional powder synthesis have to be overcome and primarily justify the aim of finding a clean 

vapor-based route for MOF synthesis, preferably in a clean room environment. For device integration 

a paradigm shift has to follow and is seen as the key for implementation of MOFs into electronic 

devices. This evolution is formulated in the consecutive roadmaps of Allendorf et al., (2011) and Stassen 

et al., (2017). Microfabrication of MOFs by thin film deposition and patterning are highlighted.  

 

In the following review recent advances of vapor-based techniques for the synthesis of MOFs will be 

illustrated with concrete examples. Synthesis routes of the latest publications will be categorized and 

discussed. Research potentials and challenges will be summarized.  Recently, Stassen et al.,35 have 

already identified state-of-the art approaches and directions that have been used in a few number of 

publications involving vapor-based methods as shown in Table 1.

It has to be emphasized, that from all the five presented synthesis routes only number (3) and (4) with 

the two publications of Stassen et al.,30 and the work of Ahvenniemi and Karppinen36 are completely 

based on vapor-phase approaches. Following the summary in Table 1 in more detail, several multi-

step methods can be classified into sacrificial metal oxide methods, and in organometallic precursor 

routes. In the first category a metal oxide like ZnO is deposited by ALD or PVD, and then transformed 

into a MOF in a subsequent step. This conversion can either be of (1) solvothermal nature using a 

linker containing solution, or promoted by a (2) melted linker phase, or (3) by a vaporized linker in a 

CVD process. These sacrificial methods are all multi-step methods and only the MOF-CVD approach 

is completely based on vapor-based techniques. The second category focuses on the layer-by-layer 

ALD/MLD deposition of MOFs by use of organometallic and organic linker precursors. First trials 

of MOF-ALD/MLD by Salmi et al., used zinc acetate (ZnAc2) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid 

(terephthalic acid)  to form MOF–537 thin films or ZnAc2 and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid to form 

IRMOF-838 thin films. In both cases non-porous, amorphous films were deposited and could be 

crystallized as a porous MOF by a subsequent two-step treatment. In case of the MOF-5 thin film, the 

crystallization of a non-porous structure was firstly achieved in moist air for 72 h under 60% humidity, 

followed by a second, solvothermal treatment with dimethylformamide (DMF) at 150 °C for 60 min 

in an autoclave to obtain a porous MOF-5. Unfortunately, film continuity got lost during 

crystallization as shown by SEM and a surface roughening was observed. The match with MOF-5 was 

demonstrated by XRD and FTIR. The XRD diffractogram showed a high intensity 2? reflection at 

9.8°, typical for the MOF-5 (220) planes of the large unit cell shown in Figure 11. FTIR spectra 

showed characteristic bands for the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of COO- 

coordinating the zinc nodes.39

In the following, a closer look is given to the Nature Materials paper of Stassen et al.,30 in which thin 

films of ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate framework) were synthesized as depicted in Figure 12. Complete 

transformation of an ALD deposited, sub-10 nm sacrificial ZnO film into a uniform MOF film by a 17 

times thickness expansion is reported when exposed to gaseous 2-methylimidazole (HMIM). 

Crystallinity of the ZIF-8 film was confirmed by XRD and homogeneous composition throughout the 

whole film was proven by TOF-SIMS. The surface roughness determined by AFM was shown to be 

much smoother compared to similar films synthesized by solvothermal methods. The characteristic, 

permanent porosity of MOFs was demonstrated by gas adsorption isotherms. Furthermore, the high 

conformity of the initially deposited ZnO film enabled equally conformal ZIF-8 coatings even on 

complex nanopillar structures as shown in Figure 13. The formed water in the vapor-solid conversion 

of the ZnO to ZIF-8 is assumed to play a major role as a mobility-enhancing liquid. As confirmed by 

real-time XRD monitoring the crystallization rate decreased when water was extracted by a dry N2 

gas flow compared to an increased crystallization rate when a humid N2 flow was used. Also the 

increase of conversion temperature from 115 °C to 130 °C had a significant influence on the 

transformation rate due to faster neutralization reaction kinetics.  The exceptional thermal and 

chemical stability of ZIF-8 has to be highlighted.14, 22 Furthermore, additive lithography (lift-off 

patterning) using a photoresist was demonstrated. As no solvents were involved there was no risk of 

photoresist distortion, dissolution or danger of collapsing the fragile pillar arrays. This proves the 

applicability of vapor-based methods for industrial nanofabrication standards and leaves solution based 

methods behind. In summary, the work of Stassen et al., can be seen as a milestone in MOF-CVD 

synthesis for device integration of the prototypic, microporous and crystalline ZIF-8 structure.

Additionally and in particular, the work of Ahvenniemi and Karppinen36 has to be highlighted as it 

reports for the first time a direct MOF build-up in a ALD/MLD layer-by-layer manner in contrast to 

the two-step approach of Stassen et al., Crystalline Cu(II)terephthalate (Cu-TP) thin films with 

characteristic paddlewheel structure as shown in Figure 14 were formed bottom-up in a narrow

A linear ALD/MLD process with constant GPC and saturative surface reactions are reported for the

process was shown to be reversible upon heating to 200 °C for 2 days. Lattice expansion during water 

uptake could be imaged by a 2? peak shift to lower values and a peak broadening due to inhomogeneous 

H2O distribution. In addition to Cu-TP36, also crystalline Ca-TP50, crystalline Li-TP51 and amorphous 

Eu-TP52 hybrid films were reported by Karppinen et al., showing the versatility of this ALD/MLD 

approach. In particular interesting, the Eu-TP thin film yielded a red luminescence under UV 

irradiation and an antenna effect of the organic ligand. Very recent works of Mai et al., (2017) 

demonstrate an ALD/MLD route using an organometallic Er guanidinate precursor in combination 

with the organic 3,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid, where the organic ligand is an optimized luminescence 

sensitizer.53 By use of other vapor-based methods, thin films of luminescent lanthanide containing 

imidazolate networks were also reported in two publications54, 55 by Müller-Buschbaum and co-

workers both in a CVD aided process and a PVD route enhanced by Pulsed Laser Depositon (PLD). 

 

In conclusion, the potentials and challenges of the recently grown research of vapor-synthesized 

MOFs are the following. It has been discussed that traditional MOF synthesis processes are based on 

powder preparation and wet chemical solvothermal routes that are incompatible with the demands of 

the microelectronics industry. Issues are chemical contamination, corrosion and insufficient size 

control down to the nanoscale. Furthermore, producibility and cost concerns inhibited the 

implementation into electronic devices. As a consequence new synthesis routes are demanded and 

vapor phase based deposition processes are seen as the answer. The advances in the deposition of 

organic moieties in the last decade open up the possibility to produce MOFs in a cleaner, precise way 

in order to fulfil industrial requirements for quality, scalability, cost and nanofabrication standards. By 

use of several precursors and the sequential, self-terminating character of ALD/MLD processes multi-

layered MOF structures with tuneable properties can be created. Vapor deposition also offers the 

opportunity to conduct post-synthetic vapor-solid modification on existing MOFs35. Moreover, CVD 

with organometallic precursors was also used to load open framework structures with nanoclusters, 

for instance by use of DEZ in order to form a ZnO@MOF-5 nanocomposite.39  Luminescent hybrids 

and LnMOF were identified as a highly interesting class which have already been synthesized 

involving vapor-based methods. Because of the complex chemistry of MOF crystallization many 

challenges can be identified for the development of vapor deposition techniques. Nevertheless, first 

promising synthesis routes were reviewed in this chapter. Further in-depth research should focus on 

the understanding of growth mechanisms and the optimization of film quality parameters. A high 

crystal quality must be achieved without an increase in surface roughness and loss of film continuity 

as it has been reported in several multi-step methods that needed a post-crystallization treatment.  

Moreover, precise film thickness, grain boundary and porosity control has to be reached. Finally, 

technological aspects like the development of ALD/MLD reactors have to be addressed. Reactors must 

be designed for the smooth transport of organic precursors from the evaporation source until the 

sample surface. Scalability and large-area uniformity have to be guaranteed by the deposition device.

6 Characterization Methods 

In this work a wide range of characterization methods (SEM, EDX, STEM, AFM, GIXRD, XRR, 

FTIR, Raman, UV-Vis, TGA) was used to analyze the fabricated thin films. Thus, these techniques 

deserve a few words in this document. The main literature sources are given at the beginning of each 

chapter.  

6.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Scanning Transmission 
Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray 

spectroscopy (EDX) 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) applies a focused electron beam to scan the surface of a sample. 

The interactions of the electrons with the sample allow for imaging its topography or analysing its 

composition.  A summary of the interaction signal that can be used for analysis is shown in Figure 15. 

For a comprehensive understanding of electron microscopy the reader is referred to the books of 

Goodhew, Humphreys and Beanland56 or Hawkes and Spence57, which were the sources for this 

chapter. 

The setup of a SEM includes the components and function principles described in the following. 

Conventionally, the whole setup is in vacuum to avoid interaction of electrons with gas molecules. An 

electron source emits free electrons by thermionic emission in a tungsten filament, a lanthanum 

hexaboride cold cathode or by a field emission gun (FEG). FEGs are increasingly being used for high 

resolution imaging due to brilliant electron beams with small diameters in the range of 1 to 10 nm. 

Then, high voltage in the range of typically 1 to 30 kilovolts accelerates the electrons towards the 

sample. Inductive coils act as electromagnetic lenses and focus and deflect the electron beam in order 

to scan the sample surface line by line. The interaction of the electron probe with the sample includes 

for instance creation of secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE) which can be 

captured by suitable detectors.

CHARACTERIZATION METHODS 20 

SE with energies in the range of several eV are created by the primary electrons in the sample surface 

within a depth of a few nanometers. They can be detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which is 

placed aside of the sample or an InLense detector, which is placed above the sample in an annular 

manner around the electron beam axis. SE images mainly exhibit a topographical contrast of the 

surface morphology as the SE extraction depends on the incident angle and diameter of the electron 

beam. Due to the so-called edge effect more SE can leave the sample at edges and lead to an increased 

brightness in these areas as shown in Figure 16. Pictures with high depth of field and plastic 

appearance can be produced. Moreover, but to a lesser extent the extraction of electrons is dependent 

on the atomic number, chemical bondings and charging effects leading to a material contrast. Images 

with increased material contrast can be obtained by use of the signal of the BSE with energies in the 

range of keV. This is based on the fact that heavy elements backscatter more than light elements and 

appear brighter in the image.

surface at edges and lead to a brighter image in these areas compared to a flat surface perpendicular to the 

electron beam. Taken from the “Electron Microscopy Site” of ETH Zürich.A  

 

Electrical conductivity is a requirement for SEM samples in order to avoid an electrical charging. 

Sample charging can lead to sample movement due to electrostatic interaction with the electron beam. 

Imaging of isolating samples can be enabled by coating with a conductive layer. For this purpose 

sputter deposition of gold or a carbon coating by means of a carbon evaporator are commonly used. 

Besides the imaging function most of the commercial SEMs nowadays have also the possibility for 

chemical microanalysis by means of electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) or Auger 

electron analysis (AES). The electrons from the incident beam excite and eject electrons from the inner 

shells of the sample atoms into higher energetic states. This process leaves a “hole” behind, which can 

be filled by an electron coming from an outer, higher energetic shell under emission of characteristic 

X-rays. Alternatively, the hole can be filled by an electron from an upper shell under simultaneous

emission of another, so-called Auger electron. Due to the distinct, characteristic electronic structure 

of each element these electron transition processes are material dependent and therefore can be used 

for compositional analysis of a sample. 

Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy uses a scanning electron beam like SEM and many 

instrumental aspects in STEM are similar to SEM. This is in contrast to the static electron beam in 

conventional TEM. However, the signal of the electrons transmitted through the sample is used for 

imaging as shown in Figure 15. Considerably higher acceleration voltages of usually 100 to 300 kV 

are being used to let the electrons pass a sufficiently thin specimen.  The precondition for samples with 

thicknesses typically below 100 nm arises from the fact that electrons get elastically and inelastically 

scattered at the sample atoms. Therefore advanced and often complicated sample preparation methods 

are afforded to achieve suitable specimens. For instance, milling by means of a focused ion beam (FIB) 

or electro polishing are used for preparing thin sample slices. Nanostructured materials (nanoparticles, 

nanowires etc.) often allow an easier preparation by bringing them into suspension and placing them 

onto special TEM grids. 

There exist two operation modes for TEM, which define the contrast mechanisms for imaging and 

content of information that can be obtained: bright-field mode and dark-field mode. In the bright field 

or transmission mode the unscattered beam is detected by a centered aperture in the optical axis for 

sample imaging. Contrast arises from differences in sample thickness and density. Thick and dense 

parts appear darker in the image as they inhibit electrons to pass through. In well oriented crystalline 

samples atomic columns can be imaged and fringes from the lattice planes get visible. Furthermore, a 

diffraction contrast appears as electron scattering in particular crystal orientations is greatly increased 

so that scattered electrons will not be detected in the optical axis. Moreover, crystal defects can be 

detected due to this diffraction contrast and, additionally, a compositional contrast arises from the Z-

dependent inelastic scattering of electrons. The second TEM operation mode is the dark-field mode. 

The internal structure of thin samples can be revealed due to the aforementioned scattering of 

electrons. In the dark-field the aperture is placed aside from the optical axis in order to catch the 

diffracted electrons. Diffraction patterns can be observed in order to study the crystal structure.  

A speciality of STEM compared to conventional TEM with a fixed electron beam is the possibility of 

spectroscopic mapping. Compositional analysis by EDX or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) 

can be correlated to the imaging data. Furthermore, Z contrasts can be imaged effectively by use of 

high-angle annular dark field detectors (HAADF). Modern spherical aberration corrected STEMs use 

computer controlled lenses to achieve probe sizes&amp;lt;0.1nm and allow analysis on the subatomic level.

6.2 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) 

This chapter is fully based on the extensive book of Voigtländer about Scanning Probe Microscopy.58 

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a type of scanning probe microscopy with nanoscale resolution, in 

which a nanometer sharp probe tip scans the sample surface and detects the interaction forces with a 

specimen. Piezoelectric elements are used for precise movement of the tip, which is placed on a flexible, 

micrometer long cantilever. By interaction with the surface atoms of the specimen the cantilever is 

bent due to the vertical movement of the tip. This bending can be detected by several methods. For 

instance, the deflection of a laser beam that is reflected from the back of the cantilever can reveal the 

vertical movement and therefore information about the surface topography (Figure 17).  

There exist mainly three different operation modes in AFM: Contact mode (1), tapping mode (2) and 

non-contact mode (3). In the contact mode the tip is in constant contact with the sample surface. 

Signals can be obtained either in constant height of the cantilever by measuring varying forces or 

measuring the varying height at a constant force. This process is controlled by electronic feedback 

loops for instance with proportional-integral controllers.  In the tapping mode an oscillation of the tip 

is externally excited with a constant frequency near the resonance frequency of the cantilever. An 

intermittent sample contact of the tip changes the oscillation amplitude due to interaction with the 

sample. In non-contact mode the measured signal arises from resonance frequency modulation or 

amplitude modulation due to the interaction with the sample surface. The last two modes have the 

advantage that a constant mechanical contact with the sample is avoided and, thus, the risk of tip 

sticking and tip damage. Moreover, non-contact and tapping mode are preferred for the analysis of 

soft samples.

6.3 X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR) 

This chapter is based on the technical review of Yasaka which gives a brief and comprehensible 

introduction for new users of X-ray reflectometry (XRR)59. More detailed descriptions and derivations 

of the physical principles can be found in the book of Fewster.60 Early studies were done by Kiessig61 

(1931) and Parratt62 (1954).  

XRR is a non-destructive technique used for thin film analysis. Parameters like the film thickness, 

density and surface and interface roughness of single- or multilayer structures on flat substrates can 

be determined. Thin films with thickness of around 3 –to 300 nm and roughness up to 3 nm can be 

measured with a precision of 0.1 to 0.3 nm.63 This technique is not based on diffraction phenomena and 

the analyzed material can be single crystalline, polycrystalline or amorphous.63 In Figure 18 a typical 

XRR curve is given with designation of the information that it can provide. From the critical angle 

the density of the thin film material can be derived. The film thickness information is included in the 

oscillation of the Kiessig fringes61 and the amplitude reveals the density contrast between substrate 

and thin film. Surface and interface roughness can be deduced by the oscillation and intensity decay at 

higher angles.

of the provided information of its profile. Taken from Yasaka.59

material surface with changes in the grazing angle

Importantly, a difference in refractive index (difference in electron density) between thin film and 

substrate material is required. The complex refractive index n of a material for the special case of 

monochromatic X-rays is smaller than one and can be described by formula (1).64

? = 1 ? ? ? ?? (1) 

Here ? is the dispersion and ? is the absorption of the medium with magnitudes of ? ? 10-5 and      

? ? 10-6 for X-rays with wavelengths around 1 Å. For the measurement an incident X-ray beam with 

a glancing angle of typically 0° to 5° is used. For incident angles smaller than the critical angle ?c the 

X-ray beam is totally reflected as illustrated in Figure 19. This critical angle is material dependent 

and a function of the electron concentration and layer density. For angles larger than the critical angle 

the X-ray beam penetrates the thin film. For the assumption of neglected absorption the 

critical angle ?c can be determined from the dispersion in equation (2). 

?? ? ?2? (2) 

The dispersion ? in this formula is dependent on the classical electron radius re, the wavelength of the 

incident X-ray, the Avogadro number NA, the material density ?, and the molar fractions xi, atomic 

numbers Zi and the molecular weight Mi of species i as presented in equation (3).

The layer thickness t is determined from the oscillation period between fringe maxima or minima of

incident X-ray beam is considered. As described by Fewster60 an approximative formula for the film 

thickness of a single layer can be derived by using the Bragg’s equation combined with the Snell’s rule 

and is given in formula (5). The previously introduced notations are used.

6.4 Grazing Incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) 

This chapter is based on a general understanding of diffraction methods. The reader is referred to the 

classical literature about crystallography and X-ray diffraction like the book of Hammond58 or the 

introduction to X-ray physics of Als-Nielsen57. 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a non-destructive technique for the structural analysis of crystalline 

materials. Incident X-rays penetrate the sample and get scattered at the sample atoms into all 



 

CHARACTERIZATION METHODS 25 

directions. In the case of a crystal, diffraction occurs due to the periodic arrangement of the sample 

atoms. Considering the wave nature of X-rays, this means that high intensities of the diffracted beam 

can be detected at specific exit angles where constructive interference of electromagnetic radiation 

occurs. At these distinct angles the Bragg condition in equation (6) is fulfilled.   

?? = 2???? ? sin (???? ) (6) 

Herein n is a positive integer, ? is the wavelength of the incident X-rays,  dhkl is the interplanar lattice 

distance of a family of crystal planes (hkl) and ?hkl is the corresponding Bragg angle. The Miller indices 

h, k , l are used. In a typical diffractogram the intensity of the diffracted beam is commonly plotted over 

the angle 2?. The appearance of a diffraction pattern with characteristic Bragg peaks is specific for a 

certain crystal structure. Due to the concept of reciprocal space, Bragg peaks at low 2? angles 

correspond to large crystal lattice parameters and Bragg peaks at large 2? angles to small lattice 

parameters.  

Grazing Incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) is a special type of XRD for analysing the crystalline 

structure of thin films and nanostructures. X-rays under grazing incidence are used to enhance the 

surface sensitivity in order to accentuate the thin film signal compared to the substrate signal.  

Experimentally, mostly an asymmetric measurement setup as shown in Figure 20 is chosen in contrast 

to the symmetric Bragg-Brentano geometry that is conventionally used for structural analysis of bulk 

materials in powder diffraction. This means, that the incident angle of primary X-rays in GIXRD is 

fixed and the diffracted beams are by a moveable detector. Soller slits on the detector side are used for 

collimation. For further reading about structural analysis of thin films and chapters about GIXRD it 

is referred to the literature.63, 65

6.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) 

This brief overview is based on the review of Coats and Redfern.66 

In a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) the weight, or differential weight change respectively, of a 

sample is measured as a function of temperature which is linearly increased over time. Often the 

relative weight with regard to the initial weight in percent is used. For the measurement the sample 

is placed on a microbalance in a heatable analysis chamber. Inside this oven a temperature profile can 

be programmed and is controlled by a thermoelement. A purging gas can be used to simulate different 

atmospheres. The weight changes of the sample at characteristic temperatures are a sign for chemical 

or physical processes like evaporation, sublimation, adsorption and desorption processes, 

decomposition or oxidation or reduction reactions. Thus, conclusions about the sample composition 

can be drawn. With regard to the analysis of ALD/MLD precursors TGA can help to choose the 

temperature to which the canisters have to be heated for precursor evaporation.  

 

6.6 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 

The following is based on the chapter about infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the book of Yadav.67 

In IR spectroscopy the interaction (absorption, transmission or reflectance) of radiation in the infrared 

(IR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum with a solid, liquid or gaseous sample is observed. 

Absorption of IR radiation leads to quantized vibrational or rotational energy changes in the analyzed 

substance. Figure 21 shows an example for two types of stretching vibrations. Consequently, IR 

spectra are often referred as vibrational-rotational spectra. The energy transfer leading to these 

excited molecular modes creates absorption bands in the corresponding spectra. Absorption bands 

appear in characteristic ranges and are therefore specific for bonding types or functional groups. 

Therefore IR spectroscopy is widely used for structural analysis and for identification of compounds. 

For further reading the reader is referred to the literature like the book of Nakamoto68 which presents 

an extensive work about spectroscopy of inorganic and coordination compounds, while Yadav67 gives 

a brief introduction for spectroscopy of organic compounds.

CHARACTERIZATION METHODS 27 

In an IR spectrum typically the absorbance or transmittance of IR light is plotted on the vertical axis. 

On the horizontal axis an energy equivalent of the spectral range is represented, which can be the 

wavelength in µm, frequency in s-1 or most commonly the wavenumber in cm-1. Usually a spectral 

range in the ordinary infrared from around 4000 to 667 cm-1 is investigated. The region below 1500 

cm-1 is called fingerprint region in which compounds are identified due to their unique absorption 

pattern. While conventional, dispersive IR spectrometers obtain the spectrum by successive variation 

of a narrow wavelength range, modern Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers use 

Michelson-interferometers and can deliver high resolution by recording a wide spectral range at once. 

Interferograms are instantly converted into spectra by Fourier transformation. This fast and precise 

data acquisition is the reason why mostly FTIR spectrometers are used nowadays. The sample 

preparation depends on the aggregate state of the specimen. Solid powders can be mixed and pestled 

together with a dry KBr powder. The mixture is then pressed into a transparent pellet with a special 

dye. Alternatively, thin films can be deposited on bare KBr discs. KBr shows no absorption in the IR 

spectrum and therefore does not influence the measurement result of the analyte. 

 

6.7 Raman spectroscopy 

Likewise the previous paragraph the following is based on the book of Yadav.67 

Raman spectroscopy is another technique dealing with transitions in vibrational and rotational energy 

levels of molecules upon absorption of electromagnetic radiation. Thus, it has a close relation to IR 

spectroscopy. However, different methods of excitation are used and the absorption mechanisms are 

based on different spectroscopic selection rules. While IR absorption bands indicate change in dipole 

moments of bonds, Raman intensity signifies a change in polarizability of bonds. Consequently, 

electrically symmetrical bonds are without dipole moment do not absorb in the IR region (IR inactive), 

but do absorb in Raman spectroscopy (Raman active). Therefore, IR and Raman spectroscopy are 

complementary techniques. In Raman spectroscopy typically a laser is used as monochromatic 

irradiation source with wavelength in the near UV, visible or near IR region of the electromagnetic 

spectrum. The laser light is scattered when it passes a transparent sample. The scattering process can 

be either elastic (Rayleigh scattering) or inelastic. The inelastically scattered light has a characteristic 

wavelength shift. The scattered light can be either shifted to lower wavelengths by an energy loss 

(Stokes scattering) or to higher wavelengths by an energy uptake (Anti-Stokes). The Stokes and Anti-

Stokes lines are symmetrically displaced in wavenumbers around the parental Rayleigh line. However, 

the Stokes transition is more probable than the Anti-Stokes and, thus, Stokes lines have higher 

intensity than the Anti-Stokes lines. Therefore, only the Stokes side is usually presented in Raman 

spectra in which the Raman intensity is typically plotted versus the wavenumber. Raman shifts appear 

in the IR region from about 100 to 3000 cm-1. Complementary to IR spectroscopy these characteristic 

shifts can be used for identification of organic compounds as a fingerprint. 



 

CHARACTERIZATION METHODS 28 

6.8 Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) 

This paragraph is mainly based on the respective chapter about UV-Vis spectroscopy in the book of 

Yadav.67 For the part concerning Tauc-gaps the reader is also referred to the book of Stenzel about 

“The Physics of Thin Film Optical Spectra”.69 

Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis) analyzes the absorption, transmission or reflectance 

of electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet spectrum with wavelengths from about 10 to 400 nm 

and visible spectrum with wavelengths from about 400 to 800 nm. In these regions characteristic 

excitations of valence electrons take place. UV-Vis spectroscopy is therefore a standard 

characterization method in organic chemistry for analysis of electronic transitions from lower to 

higher molecular orbitals and can be used to detect conjugated multiple bonds. In the field of 

semiconductors UV-Vis is also applied to characterize the optical properties of thin films on wafers 

and determine optical bandgaps.69 

A spectrophotometer measures the intensity of light before and after passing the sample in order to 

obtain the relative transmittance. Transparent liquids in cuvettes can be measured like that. Solids can 

be measured in diffuse reflectance where the reflected intensity of a powder for instance is compared 

to the reflected intensity of an ideally reflecting reference material, such as a white tile made from 

BaSO4. Often spectrophotometers are double beam systems for the purpose of the reference 

measurement. As light sources often a deuterium arc lamp is used to cover the UV region and a halogen 

lamp for example can be used to cover the visible spectrum. Monochromators with diffraction gratings 

allow for stepwise selection of the wavelength to scan through the spectrum. Photomultiplier tubes or 

photodiodes detect the transmitted or reflected light. 

UV-Vis spectroscopy can be used for the determination of semiconductor bandgaps as electrons absorb 

a characteristic energy h? when excited from the valence to the conduction band. It is referred to the 

technical instruction of Shimadzu about the “measurements of band gap in compound 

semiconductors”.B Originally deduced by Tauc for amorphous semiconductors the following 

equation (7) is valid.69-71 

(???)1/? = ?(?? ? ??) 
(7) 

Here ? is the optical absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h? is the photon energy, h is Planck’s 

constant, ? is the frequency, Eg is the optical bandgap and n is ½ for a direct band gap semiconductor. 

In case of acquiring the UV-Vis spectrum in diffuse reflectance mode, commonly Kubelka-Munk units 

are used to convert the measured reflectivity R? into an absorption signal. This can be realized by use

If (h?F(R?)² is plotted over h? the optical absorption spectrum has a distinct absorption edge with a 

linear regime marking the absorption edge. In a so-called Tauc-plot an extrapolation of this linear part 

onto the abscissa obtains the optical bandgap energy Eg.





 

EXPERIMENTAL 31 

7 Experimental 

The experimental part includes a technical description of the used ALD reactor, depiction of the 

utilized precursors and the several ALD/MLD routes followed. ALD synthesis of ZnO thin films was 

performed including their exposure with HMIM aiming at a vapor-solid transformation into a ZIF-8 

MOF. Furthermore, ALD/MLD experiments for direct gas-phase deposition of a ZIF-8 MOF and 

deposition of terephthalate hybrid films are described. In the experimental details, where literature 

results are attempted to reproduce, the choice of parameters is compared and justified with the former 

works. 

 

7.1 Description of the ALD reactor 

The reactor used for thin film deposition in this work is a non-commercial, home-built cross-flow 

reactor, as shown in Figure 22. Therefore the system can be easily modified and adapted to the 

requirements of a specific ALD/MLD process. Three reservoirs (e.g. stainless steel canisters as shown 

in Figure 23) can potentially enable the sequential use of up to three precursors. The samples are 

placed in the heatable reactor chamber, in which the precursors are injected with a programmable 

sequence order for deposition at controlled temperature. N2 serves as the carrier gas for the precursors 

and the flow can be adjusted with a mass flow controller. In the purging steps N2 flow and dry scroll 

pump are used for evacuation of the reactor chamber. Heating mats around the gas tubing are used for 

elevated temperatures throughout the whole system. The temperature is controlled by various 

thermocouples in the reactor chamber, at the gas lines and the evaporation sources. Main features of 

the system are a deposition temperature up to about 450 °C, theoretically possible by the heating 

elements, and an evacuation base pressure down to 4.4 × 10-1 Torr. High speed pneumatic valves for 

precursor injection allow pulsing times in the range of milliseconds.

are replaced by heating jackets in the frame of a system upgrade. 

 

 

Figure 23: Precursor canister with a manual 

valve and a VCR cap. The refilling of these 

canisters is performed inside a glovebox. 

In general the ALD system has to guarantee the three main steps (1) evaporation of precursor, (2) 

transport of gaseous precursor into the reaction chamber, and (3) deposition on solid sample surface. 

The sequential ALD cycle (precursor A injection/inert gas purge/precursor B injection/inert gas 

purge) is described for the classical example of ZnO deposition by means of the reactor scheme in 

Figure 24. Sequential injection of water (H2O) and diethylzinc (DEZ) with intermediate purging steps 

is performed. The HMIM canister is neglected in this process. One ALD cycle is exemplarily described 

in the following: 

1) V2 open, V1/V3/V4 closed

2) V4 open, V1/V2/V3 closed

EXPERIMENTAL 33 

 

Figure 24: Simplified gas flow scheme of the used ALD reactor. N2 gas is used as carrier gas to transport gaseous 

precursors into the reactor chamber where the sample is placed. N2 has also the role of the purging gas after each 

precursor pulsing, in order to remove the surface reaction by-products and unreacted precursors. The high speed 

pneumatic valves V1, V2 and V3 can be opened and closed independently for sequential precursor injection. The 

temperature control in the reactor chamber and in the stainless steel tubes is guaranteed by heating mats around 

the gas tubing and by various thermocouples. A Pirani gauge is used for pressure monitoring. A dry scroll pump 

evacuates and cleans the chamber from excess precursors in the purging steps. A trap with a zeolite filter protects 

the vacuum pump from accumulation of excess precursors or by-products. 

 

In the current state of the ALD system the temperature control with the applied heating mats is not 

optimal for long run depositions at elevated temperatures. In an introduced system modification 

heating mats are replaced step-by-step by heating jackets with integrated thermocouples to ensure a 

more uniform heating and temperature control in the gas tubing. This upgrade, enables the system to 

be more user friendly for removing and further refilling the precursor canisters in a glovebox. 

 

7.2 Used precursors and their thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 

Precursors have to be well chosen in terms of volatility, thermal stability and reactivity. They can be 

solid or liquid and have to be evaporated for vapor deposition. By simple thermal heating the vapor 

pressure is increased. In Table 2 the here used precursors are listed. The precursors were stored in a 

glovebox under inert atmosphere to avoid any contamination or chemical modification. This means 

that the precursor canisters have to be refilled inside the glovebox. For the solid powder precursors 

this has the advantage that moisture adsorption can be prevented and the flowability of the powder 

particles is guaranteed for an easy refilling process. 

All of the precursors have been reported for use in ALD or MLD before. For ZnO deposition the 

conventional precursor pair diethylzinc (DEZ; Sigma-Aldrich) as Zn source and milli-Q H2O as 



 

EXPERIMENTAL 34 

oxygen source were chosen.72 DEZ is a liquid metal-organic compound and reacts with water. 2-

methylimidazole (HMIM; Sigma-Aldrich 99%) and terephthalic acid (TPA; Sigma-Aldrich 98%) are 

organic precursors that are common linker molecules in organic-inorganic hybrids or MOFs, 

respectively. The terephthalate moiety is the organic linker of the aforementioned MOF-537 or other 

terephthalate hybrids reported by Karppinen36, 50-52 and the imidazole is part of the zeolitic imidazolate 

framework ZIF-8 reported by Stassen30. The volatile Cu(TMHD)2 and Eu(TMHD)3 chelates are  

commercially available metal sources for ALD processes (Strem Chemicals Inc.) and their synthesis 

was reported elsewhere.73, 74

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the solid precursors was performed in order to determine the 

onset of sublimation and thermal stability. This helps to define the experimental parameters in terms 

of temperature range for the ALD process avoiding premature precursor decomposition. For this 

purpose HMIM, TPA, Cu(TMHD)2 and Eu(TMHD)3 powders were analyzed in a SHIMADZU TGA-

50 device. A temperature profile with 5 °C/min up to 400 °C was ramped. A N2 gas flow of 20 ml/min 

was used in accordance to the fact that N2 would also be the carrier gas in the ALD/MLD process. 

 



 

EXPERIMENTAL 35 

7.3 ALD of ZnO thin films 

ZnO thin films with increasing number of ALD cycles (10, 25, 50, 100, 200) and, therefore, increasing 

thickness were deposited on 500 to 550 µm thick boron doped Si(100) wafers (Siegert Wafer GmbH, 

Germany) with dimension ? 1x1 cm² in order to study the GPC. In order to verify the conformality 

of the ALD process, nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs, in the following 

denoted “N-CNTs”) forests were also coated. The N-CNTs were CVD-grown in-house in a quartz-

tube furnace reactor, as reported elsewhere.75, 76  

Before deposition, the Si(100) substrates were cleaned in a Piranha solution with a 3:1 mixture of 

sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), rinsed with distilled water and dry-blown with 

compressed air. Piranha solution is a strong oxidizing agent used to clean substrates from organic 

residues. Moreover, it allows terminating the substrate surface with OH-groups facilitating the initial 

surface reaction for the subsequent ZnO deposition.77 A conventional ALD route based on the reaction 

of milli-Q H2O and diethylzinc Zn(C2H5)2 was used.72, 78, 79 In formula (10) the * marks the surface 

species.

The precursors H2O and DEZ were sequentially injected into the reactor chamber by pneumatic high-

speed valves from external canisters which were kept at room temperature (RT). The precursors were 

transported by a N2 carrier gas flow of 100 sccm through the gas delivery tubing, which was heated 

to 100 °C in order to avoid condensation. The reactor chamber was heated to a deposition temperature 

of 100 °C. The pulsing, residence and purging times for one ALD cycle are summarized in Table 3. 

Long residence times of the precursor in the chamber after injection were used to ensure a complete 

surface reaction and long purging times were used to guarantee a full removal of unreacted precursors 

and that only one precursor at a time was present in the reactor chamber.

The ZnO thin films on Si(100) and N-CNTs were analyzed by SEM and EDX in a Hitachi FE-SEM 

SU-70 at 15 kV acceleration voltage equipped with a field emission gun. Additionally, some ZnO 

coated N-CNTs were prepared on a HC300-Cu holey carbon film as a TEM grid by dry adhesion 

(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, USA) for further analysis in a FE-STEM/SEM Hitachi HD-

2700. Film thickness and density measurements by XRR and structural analysis by GIXRD were 

carried out in a Philips X’Pert MRD diffractometer (Cu K? @ 45 kV, 40 mA). AFM images were 



 

EXPERIMENTAL 36 

acquired in a Multimode SPM Nanoscope IIIA AFM (Veeco Instruments Inc., USA) in tapping mode 

using an ultra-sharp silicon tip SSH-NCH (Nanosensors, USA). The freeware image software WSxM 

4.0 Beta 8.5 was used for data processing of the AFM images.80 Image correction was performed by 

“plane” and “flatten” and another “simple flatten” with subtract type “parabola”. 

 

7.4 Attempts towards ZIF-8 MOF thin films 

In an effort to synthesize ZIF-8 MOF thin films on Si(100) two routes were followed. Firstly, the 

transformation of a sacrificial ZnO film into ZIF-8 by a MOF-CVD process was conducted. Secondly, 

a direct gas-phase process by MOF-MLD was studied. 

 

7.4.1 MOF-CVD of sacrificial ZnO films 

Following the strategy of a vapor-solid reaction and transformation of a ZnO thin film into a ZIF-8 

MOF by Stassen et al.,30 a post-treatment with 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) was performed on ZnO 

samples as processed in 7.2. ZnO films with 50 ALD cycles with a corresponding film thickness of 

18 nm were used, similar to the 15 nm ZnO films reported by Stassen. Different ZnO thin films were 

exposed to HMIM vapor at several temperatures (100 °C, 110 °C and 130 °C) with treatment processes 

as shown in Table 4. Several pulsing/purging sequences with different cycles and effective treatment 

durations were tried. The HMIM canisters were kept at evaporation temperatures between 100 and 

110 °C, similar to be reported by Stassen. However, the HMIM injection had cycled character, in 

contrast to the continuous vapor treatment of Stassen. The effective HMIM treatment duration was 

chosen to be at least 30 min as reported by Stassen. In a process shown in Table 5 the transformation 

reaction was extended to an even longer exposure duration at higher exposure temperature of 130 °C 

and under humid condition which was provided by additional pulsing of water.

Samples were analyzed by SEM/EDX in a Hitachi FE-SEM SU-70 at 15 kV acceleration voltage and 

by Raman spectroscopy in a Bruker RFS-100/S (1064 nm laser, 400 mW) in a range from 

100 to 4000 cm-1 with the objective to detect the organic moiety. Structural analysis by GIXRD was 

performed in a Philips X’Pert MRD diffractometer (Cu K? @ 45 kV, 40 mA) in a 2? scan range from 

10° to 80°. 

 

7.4.2 MOF-ALD/MLD by DEZ and HMIM 

Vapor-phase deposition of ZIF-8 on Si(100) and N-CNTs by a direct ALD/MLD route using DEZ as 

Zn source and HMIM as imidazolate linkers was studied. Deposition temperatures between 100 and 

130 °C were used. As shown in Table 6 different pulsing/residence/purging schemes and deposition 

cycles (200, 300, 400) were applied in order to create a MOF thin film from DEZ and HMIM. The 

HMIM canister temperature was kept between 100 and 110 °C. In another attempt the sequential use 

of three precursor sources DEZ, HMIM and H2O was applied as shown in Table 7.

Additionally, N-CNT samples were prepared by dry adhesion on a HC300-CU holey carbon film as a

Hitachi HD-2700. Raman spectroscopy in a Bruker RFS-100/S (1064 nm laser, 400 mW) in a range 

from 100 to 4000 cm-1 was performed for Si(100) substrates in order to detect if the organic moiety 

was deposited. 



 

EXPERIMENTAL 38 

7.5 Direct routes towards terephthalate hybrid thin films 

The following attempts to the synthesis of hybrid thin films using terephthalic acid (TPA) as the 

organic moiety are based on the previous work of Karppinen et al. (references are given in the 

experimental section).  

7.5.1 ALD/MLD by DEZ and TPA 

The precursors DEZ and TPA were sequentially injected into the reactor chamber from external 

canisters. The DEZ canister was kept at room temperature (RT). The TPA canister temperature was 

fixed at 190 °C according to thermogravimetric analysis. This is in the same range of 180 °C36, 50, 185 

°C51 and 212 °C52 used by Karppinen et al., for TPA sublimation. A N2 carrier gas flow of 100 sccm was 

applied. Depositions with 200, 300 and 400 cycles were performed and 150 °C, 175 °C and 200 °C were 

tested as deposition temperatures. The pulsing, residence and purging times for one ALD cycle are 

summarized in Table 8. Again, long pulsing and residence times were chosen for a saturated surface 

reaction. Long purging times ensure the removal of residual precursor after each injection step. 

Deposition on several substrates like Si(100),  Si with around 200 nm thermal oxide SiO2 (Siegert 

Wafer GmbH, Germany) and the in-house grown N-CNTs was performed. 

Table 8: ALD/MLD sequence of pulsing and residence times, tpulse and tresidence, of the precursors DEZ and TPA

The Zn-TPA hybrid thin films on Si(100) and N-CNTs were analyzed in top-view by SEM and EDX 

in a Hitachi FE-SEM SU-70 at 15 kV acceleration voltage equipped with a field emission gun. For 

some samples SEM cross-section views were prepared.  Coated N-CNT samples were imaged in a FE-

STEM/SEM Hitachi HD-2700. Structural analysis by GIXRD was performed in a Philips X’Pert 

MRD diffractometer (Cu K? @ 45 kV, 40 mA). Finally, FTIR spectroscopy of Zn-TP films that were 

deposited on KBr pellets was conducted in a Bruker Tensor 27 for identifying organic components. 

FTIR scans in the range between 350 and 4000 cm-1 with a resolution of 4 cm-1 resolution were 

performed. As the thin films on Si substrates yielded only a weak FTIR signal, the idea of directly 

depositing on the IR transparent KBr pellets occurred. In particular, a Zn-TP film that formed inside 

the deposition chamber and not on the substrate was scratched from the reactor wall and mixed 

together with KBr and pressed into a pellet for FTIR analysis in transmission. Moreover, pure TPA 

in a KBr pellet was measured as a reference. Furthermore, UV-Vis spectroscopy was carried out in a 

Jasco V-560 with an ISV-469 integrated sphere attachment in a wavelength range between 

250 to 850 nm for films deposited at 150, 175 and 200 °C. A white BaSO4 tile was used as reference. 



 

EXPERIMENTAL 39 

Spectra were obtained already converted to Kubelka-Munk units from the measurement software. 

Bandgaps were determined from Tauc-plots. AFM images were acquired in a Multimode SPM 

Nanoscope IIIA AFM (Veeco Instruments Inc., USA) in tapping mode using an ultra-sharp silicon tip 

SSH-NCH (Nanosensors, USA). The freeware image software WSxM 4.0 Beta 8.5 was used for data 

processing of the AFM images.80 

 

7.5.2 ALD/MLD by Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA 

Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA were used as precursors following the routine of the previous depositions of 

DEZ and TPA. Three attempts of deposition with the parameters summarized in Table 9 were 

completed when handing in this manuscript. In a first attempt, the TPA sublimation temperature was 

fixed at 190 °C as in chapter 7.5.1 and the Eu(TMHD)3 sublimation temperature at 140 °C as reported 

by Giedraityte et al.52 These authors investigated a deposition temperature range between 240 and 

340 °C with a reported ALD window between 260 and 300 °C. As Giedraityte found evidence for a 

crystalline film at 300 °C, this deposition temperature was chosen in the first attempt. During film 

deposition a similar working pressure of 1.6 – 1.8 torr (2.1 – 2.4 mbar) compared to the 1.5 – 3 torr (2 

– 4 mbar) used by Giedraityte was maintained. Giedraityte used the following ALD/MLD sequence 

in comparison: 1 s Eu(TMHD)3 / 2 s N2 purge / 2 s TPA / 4 s N2 purge. As no film formation was 

observed after the first attempt, other deposition parameters as shown in Table 9 were tried. The 

300 °C of deposition temperature in the first run led to degradation of the Silicone VMQ O-ring 

(Eriks nv) used for sealing the chamber and forced lower deposition temperatures in the subsequent 

runs.

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 42 

8.1 Thermogravimetric analysis of solid precursors 

Before the ALD/MLD deposition experiments the thermal evaporation and stability properties of the 

used precursors were studied by TGA as shown in Figure 26. In the top graph an overview of the 

curves is given over the whole temperature range of data acquisition. Horizontal plateaus indicate 

constant weight. The decreasing relative weights (negative differential weight changes) in the curves 

are related to weight loss due to thermal evaporation of the precursors. HMIM evaporates first, 

followed by Cu(TMHD)2, Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA. The scaling in the top graph prevents a precise 

detection of the beginning of weight loss for each curve. Therefore, in the bottom graph an inset is 

given to determine the onset of evaporation of the solid precursors and to choose the canister 

temperature for the ALD/MLD process. Canister temperatures that were used in literature are 

presented in Table 10. The evaporation temperatures are verified by the here presented TGA result. 

However, and in particular for the case of TPA, higher temperatures can be used for creating more 

vapor pressure. HMIM, Cu(TMHD)2 and TPA are completely evaporated before reaching their 

boiling/decomposition points, that are collected in Table 10. Their relative weights decrease 

continuously until 0%.  In contrast, the relative weight curve of Eu(TMHD)3 shows a transition into 

a plateau after reaching the decomposition temperature at 275 °C. Steps in the Cu(TMHD)2 curve 

around 100 °C could be related to evaporation of water. Although the powder samples are stored in a 

glove box under inert conditions, it is possible that the powder caught humidity during sample 

transport. Relative weights of more than 100 % in the TGA curves could be caused by the additional 

or unstable N2 flow that influences the weight measurement of the microbalance. For an improvement 

a weight calibration with N2 flow should be done before the experiments. Further thermal analysis 

could be carried out by methods such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), for example to 

determine vapor pressure curves.

8.2 ALD of ZnO thin films 

In this chapter the successful growth of homogeneous, polycrystalline ZnO thin films is demonstrated 

both on Si(100) and nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) by use of SEM/STEM for imaging 

and EDX for composition analysis. Wurtzite crystal structure of the forming ZnO nanocrystallites 

was proven by GIXRD. A GPC of 1.9 Å deduced from XRR film thickness measurements was found 

for the ZnO layer growth and is according to the literature. 

 

8.2.1 SEM/EDX/STEM of ZnO films 

The following top-view SEM images show the growth of ZnO thin films both on flat Si(100) surfaces 

as well as on N-CNTs. From Figure 27 to Figure 32 the evolution of the growing film from the bare 

Si and N-CNT substrates, over 50 cycles to 200 cycles of ZnO deposition is illustrated for a deposition 

temperature of 100 °C from top to bottom. All pictures were taken at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV 

by use of a secondary electron (SE) detector.  



 

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 45 

Compared to the bare Si substrate in Figure 27 the forming ZnO film in Figure 28 and in Figure 

29 exhibit a brighter material contrast due to the heavier Zn metal ions containing in the film. 

Furthermore, the rough surface is revealed by the topographical contrast due to the edge effect 

shown in the theory chapter 6.1 in Figure 16. While for the 50 cycles of ZnO deposition in Figure 

28 the ZnO crystallites are still small and look round from above, they develop to be more elongated 

for 200 cycles in Figure 29. This more needle-like morphology is probably related to the anisotropic 

c-axis crystal growth of the wurtzite ZnO structure that is reported in the literature.78 However, 

for a deposition temperature of 100 °C the crystallite orientation is randomly distributed as 

additionally confirmed later by GIXRD in chapter 8.2.3. It has to be considered that a top view can 

only give a 2D limited information. Jeon et al., present top-view SEM images for ZnO films grown 

at 90 and 110 °C.81 At 90 °C the morphology looks also granular from above, but XRD 

measurements reveal a preferential c-axis crystal growth in the (100) direction. Hence, the ZnO 

columns are grown perpendicular to the Si substrate surface at 90 °C. At 110 °C they also observe 

randomly oriented, elongated crystallites. The deposition, here at 100°C, could be in a transition 

region where temperature deviations could either lead to the one or the other morphology.81 

In Figure 33 an EDX mapping was performed on the 200 ALD cycles ZnO film on Si(100). The 

homogenous distribution of Zn (red) and O (green) is visualized qualitatively. An EDX spectrum 

shown in Figure 34 was recorded from the same sample. The EDX spectrum qualitatively proves 

the presence of ZnO by the Zn L?, Zn K? and O K? lines. The C K? signal is due to the carbon tape 

that was used to mount the sample on the sample holder. The Al sample holder creates an Al K? 

signal. However, the strongest signal Si K? comes from the ?500 µm thick Si substrate. Figure 35 

shows a corresponding EDX spectrum of 200 ALD cycles ZnO on N-CNTs. Intense Zn and O 

signals are observed, besides the low signals from the Fe catalyst from CVD growth of N-CNTs, Al 

sample holder and the Si substrate.

The ZnO films on the nanotubes from Figure 30 to Figure 32 demonstrate that ALD is a powerful 

technique to create uniform coatings on nanoscale substrates with complex geometries. After 50 

ALD cycles of ZnO deposition the N-CNTs are already coated in conformal manner as shown in 

Figure 31. The ZnO films grown on the N-CNTs are also polycrystalline as visible in the contrast-

rich images of the coated N-CNTs. Brighter appearing parts of the bare N-CNTs or the coated N-

CNTs are mainly caused by the edge effect in bent sections of the nanotubes as marked in Figure 

32. STEM images in Figure 36 and Figure 37 show secondary electron (SE) and transmission 

electron (TE) in bright-field mode of a single N-CNT coated with 200 ALD cycles ZnO. The 

polycrystalline film morphology can be seen here in more detail. In particular, the TE images that 

reveal the lattice fringes of ZnO crystallites were analyzed by the freeware software ImageJ.C The 

lattice plane distances d were directly measured in Figure 37 b) for differently oriented crystallites 

and can be related to the results from GIXRD measurements in chapter 8.2.3., from which lattice 

plane distances dhkl of the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO could be determined (d100 = 2.8 Å; 

d002 = 2.6 Å). However, the precision of the image analysis does not allow to state whether d100 or 

d002 distances are observed.

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 52 

ALD growth of ZnO nanoparticles and polycrystalline thin films with a H2O/DEZ process on multi-

walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)82 and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)83, 84 have 

already been reported before. In the first publications the non-uniform deposition in form of the 

decoration of isolated ZnO nanoparticles was reported, but continuous coatings of ZnO layers were 

only occasionally observed. The initial nucleation of ZnO on the CNTs was recognized to be extremely 

sensitive to surface conditions. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the untreated CNTs there was seen 

a need for surface functionalization with oxygen containing reactive sites. Moreover, it was  reported 

that the degree of surface functionalization defines the growth mode of deposited metal oxide films on  

CNTs.85, 86  In the work of Pal et al., SWCNTs were activated with an ozone treatment for uniform 

ZnO film growth.84 The here used CNTs are nitrogen-doped N-MWCNTs. The nitrogen plays an 

active role for the nucleation of ZnO films and explains the here reported conformal coatings. 

Silva et al., demonstrated Zn-N bonding at the interface between N-CNTs and ZnO films by means of 

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).76 ZnO coated CNTs were proposed for application as UV 

photodetectors or as ambipolar thin film transistors. Moreover, a switchable behaviour of the 

wettability under UV irradiation was shown altering from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic.84 

 

8.2.2 XRR of ZnO films 

The thickness t and density ? of the ZnO films with 50, 100 and 200 ALD cycles of deposition were 

analyzed by XRR measurements as shown in Figure 38 and are summarized in Table 11. The GPC 

was simply derived from the thickness divided by the number of cycles. 

In Figure 38 it can be seen qualitatively that the fringe distance is increasing with decreasing number 

of cycles of deposition. This meets the expectations as the film thickness decreases with less deposition 

cycles. The thickness t was calculated from equation (5) in chapter 6.3 from adjacent fringe positions 

that are designated in the XRR curves. The XRR curves for 100 and 200 ALD cycles show clear 

fringes and the mean thickness was determined from several fringe pairs. For the 50 cycles the fringe 

positions could only be vaguely determined from the fringes adumbrated in grey. Especially for low 

film thicknesse an inhomogeneous thickness and roughness of the sample can lead to superimposed 

fringe patterns. Film densities ? were calculated by equation (4) with xZn = xO = 0.5, the molar weights 

MZn = 65.38 g/mol and MO = 16 g/mol and the atomic numbers ZZn = 30 and ZO = 8. The results are 

presented in Table 11. The density of bulk ZnO is 5.61 g/cm³. Varying critical angles can be noticed 

by comparing the three XRR curves. This effect is probably not related to the ZnO thin films which 

should approximately have the same critical angle and, thus, density. Uncertainties in densities derived 

from XRR have been reported to be very sensitive to sample alignment and beam calibration by 

Klepper et al.87 In a simple error approximation as shown in equation (11) it can be seen that an

inaccuracy of ??c = 0.05° due to the squared contribution of the critical angle in the density 

formula (4) leads to large deviations for the determined densities.

Table 11 shows the linear trend of thickness increase with the number of cycles. This is important for 

an ideal ALD process in order to predict and control the thickness of the deposited film. A linear 

process over a wide range of cycles signifies the ideal, self-limited growth behaviour without, for 

example, nucleation hindrance, precursor condensation or CVD influence. The determined GPC of 1.9 

Å is in excellent accordance to the values reported for various ZnO ALD processes summarized in 

Table 12. Moreover, the ZnO growth mechanism was studied in detail by Yousfi et al., in an in situ 

analysis of the mass variation for individual ZnO deposition cycles by means of a quartz balance. The 

mass uptake was reported to be around 0.1 to 0.12 mg/cm² corresponding to a thickness per cycle of 

1.75 to 2.1 Å, which further confirms the here found GPC.

8.2.3 GIXRD of ZnO thin films 

Structural analysis by GIXRD was carried out on the samples with 50, 100 and 200 ALD cycles of 

ZnO deposition on Si(100) substrates. The corresponding diffractograms are shown in Figure 39.

Figure 40: Wurtzite ZnO structure with designated (100) and (002) planes. Taken from Malm et al.79 

 

The ZnO deposition at 100 °C was found to yield uniform nanocrystalline films. Diffraction peaks 

related to the wurtzite ZnO structure represented in Figure 40 were distinguished. With decreasing 

cycles the peak intensities are decreasing due to the lower film thickness and the smaller volume that 

is probed by the X-ray beam. For the 50 cycles sample only the (110) peak is left to be clearly 

distinguishable from the background. 

Almost similar intensities for the (100) and (002) peak for the 200 ALD cycles sample show that the 

grown ZnO crystallites have no preferential orientation. This confirms the observations of the SEM 

analysis in chapter 8.2.1 and for a deposition temperature of 100 °C this is in accordance with literature. 

Indeed, it was reported that deposition temperature can be used to control the preferred grain 

orientation as reviewed by Tynell and Karppinen.72 For low deposition temperatures below 70 °C ZnO 

films were reported to be highly c-axis oriented along the (002) direction as shown in Figure 41.79 

Above 70 °C a-axis orientation along the (100) direction becomes more prominent and c-axis 

orientation becomes less prominent, so that in the range around 90 to 160 °C ZnO thin films are not 

textured.78, 81, 89-91 The here produced films confirm this for 100 °C. Between 160 to 200 °C grains are 

predominantly oriented along the a-axis and above 220 °C an evolution towards preferred c-axis 

orientation can be observed again. A more detailed texture analysis of the ZnO film could be performed 

by means of XRD pole figures as reported by Pung et al.78 In their paper the motivation for a textured 

film along the c-axis is the use as a seed layer for the controlled directional growth of ZnO nanowires. 

Moreover, the chemical composition, physical structure and electrical properties can be tuned and 

optimized by the deposition temperature and hence film morphology. The latter is important for 

micro- and optoelectronic applications.81

In general the peak width in a diffractogram is mainly a result of the folding of apparative parameters. 

Furthermore, in case of nanocrystalline materials with crystallite sizes below 150 to 200 nm a peak 

broadening effect can also be observed due to the finite object size.63 The linear dimension L of the 

crystallite size can be determined from the width of a peak arising from a family of planes (hkl), the full 

width at half maximum (FWHM) by means of the Scherrer formula represented in equation (12).63 The 

Scherrer formfactor K = 0.89 and the wavelength of the incident X-ray (Cu K? = 0.154 nm) are 

constants. The angular position of the analyzed Bragg peak is ?hkl. The error ?L is given by an 

uncertainty propagation of the errors ??hkl and ?FWHM in equation (13).

The crystallite size was determined for the 200 ALD cycles of ZnO deposition on Si(100), that was

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 59 

Different crystallite sizes derived by the Scherrer equation between 12 and 28 nm were obtained in 

Table 13 for manual fitting with Origin and automatized fitting with HighScore Plus. Considering 

the film thickness of 36 nm determined by XRR of the 200 ALD cycles ZnO, the values derived 

manually with Origin are arguable. The crystallite sizes determined by HighScore Plus are probably 

more accurate due to an optimized fitting routine. The here reported crystallite sizes between 12 

and 15 nm are valid for the grown ZnO films on Si(100) at 100 °C by 200 ALD cycles. Verifying this, 

Chiang et al., report a mean grain size of 13.7 nm for films grown at 100 °C on Si(100) and 17.7 nm at 

200 °C derived by the Scherrer equation.92 Pal et al., report wedge-shaped crystallites with a mean 

grain size of 21.2 nm for 230 ALD cycles ZnO grown at 200 °C on Si(100). Yuan et al., report grain 

sizes of 15.6 nm 17.1, 18.1 and 19.5 nm for ZnO thin films grown at 50, 70, 100 and 200 °C, 

respectively.89 As a conclusion it can be stated, that ALD grown ZnO films exhibit nanocrystallites 

with sizes around roughly 15 nm. The grain size, morphology and texture is dependent on the growth 

temperature as discussed above. Higher temperatures promote grain growth and thicker films contain 

larger grains as more time is given to coarsening.  

From the (100) and (002) peaks the lattice parameters a and c of the hexagonal wurtzite structure can 

be deduced by means of the Bragg’s law in equation (6). The wavelength of the incident Cu K? 

radiation with ? = 0.154 nm is used. For the hexagonal crystal systems the interplanar distance dhkl is 

related to the lattice parameters a and c by the following equation (14).93

From the peak positions of the (100) and (002) peak the lattice parameters a and c are calculated from 

the peak positions of the Origin fit (Figure 42, Table 13) by equations (15) and (16). Propagated 

incertainties are given by the merely statistical error of the peak position ??hkl as depicted above. The 

interplanar distances are d100 = 2.8 Å and d002 =2.6 Å. The lattice parameters a = 3.25 ± 0.03 Å and 

c = 5.21 ± 0.04 Å are in agreement with the data from the ICDD fileG (a = 3.25 Å; c = 5.21 Å). These

8.2.4 AFM of ZnO films 

The sample of 200 ALD cycles of ZnO on Si(100) was observed by AFM in tapping mode and the 

corresponding topography images for scanning areas of 1 µm x 1 µm and 0.5 x 0.5 µm are presented 

in Figure 43. The image areas were randomly chosen to be representative for the sample. The AFM 

images show light contrast spots with diameters up to more than 100 nm and marking heights up to 

around 30 nm. These islands can be considered as clusters of ZnO nanocrystallites that were found in 

the previous SEM and GIXRD analysis. Besides the roughness originated in the polycrystalline film 

morphology, these clusters have the main influence on the overall surface roughness of the samples 

shown here. The root mean square (RMS) roughness values deduced for the different scanning 

windows are reported in Figure 44. As the determined RMS roughness for the 5 µm x 5 µm section 

covers the largest area it can be considered as the most representative value for the overall film 

roughness. More cluster islands are taken into account than in the smaller scanning windows.

µm (left) and 0.5 µm x 0.5 µm (right). Heights are given according to the color scale bars.  

 

The here found roughness values of ALD ZnO films are compared with the literature in Figure 44. 

The choice of different scan areas in various references has to be considered. The main influence on 

the roughness is the deposition temperature and number of cycles as these parameters directly 

influence the grain growth (size and orientation) of the polycrystalline films. It has to be considered 

that the roughness increases with the deposited film thickness and increasing grain size.77, 94 

Additionally, the type and roughness of the substrate affect the final film roughness. Moreover, Pung 

et al., showed that a recrystallization by a post-annealing at 800 °C has a significant effect on the surface 

morphology, thus, leading to an increase in surface roughness.78 The here reported roughness values 

are in agreement with the literature when identical growth parameters and image areas are compared. 

Around 100 °C deposition temperatures the highest roughness values are observed. Below 100 °C and

above 200 °C the lowest roughness values are obtained. The roughness values reported for ALD 

deposited films are smaller than for solution based deposition methods. Weng et al., report RMS 

roughness values between 36 and 122 nm for electrodeposited ZnO films.95 Smooth film morphologies 

are beneficial for the performance of electronic devices, such as solar cells, in which ZnO films can be 

used as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers. The formation of smooth, conformal films by ALD 

is therefore interesting for optoelectronic applications.94

compared to literature results. Values from different authors are marked with different colors (Elam et al.,77 Yuan 

et al.,89 Pung et al.,78, Pal et al.,94 Chiang et al.92). Number of cycles and reported scan areas (5 µm x 5 µm: ?; 1 

µm x 1 µm: ?; 0.5 µm x 0.5 µm: ?) are given as additional information as they influence the result of the measured 

roughness.  

 

8.3 Attempts towards ZIF-8 MOF thin films 

In this chapter the synthesis of ZIF-8 MOF thin films on Si(100) was studied by following two different 

routes. Firstly, the transformation of a sacrificial ZnO film into ZIF-8 by a MOF-CVD process was 

attempted. Secondly, a direct gas-phase process by MOF-MLD was tried. Neither of the two studied 

routes could demonstrate the formation of a MOF thin film. Nevertheless, the experimental procedure 

and findings are explained and motivations are discussed. 

 

 



 

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 62 

8.3.1 MOF-CVD of sacrificial ZnO films 

As the successful ZnO deposition was demonstrated in this work, it was a consequent step to further 

exploit this capability by using ZnO thin film samples for a post-treatment as reported by Stassen et 

al.30 Within the given possibilities of the here used ALD equipment it was attempted to reproduce this 

work. In the work of Stassen, the solid-vapor conversion of ALD ZnO thin films with thickness 

between 3 and 15 nm by exposure to HMIM vapor at 100 °C for 30 min was proved. Here,  ALD ZnO 

thin films with thickness 10 nm (50 ALD cycles) and 18 nm (100 ALD cycles) were used and exposed 

to HMIM at 110 °C.  Upon transformation Stassen et al., report a thickness increase of a planar ZnO 

film by a factor of 17 as visible in SEM cross-sections. Here, in SEM images of ZnO coated N-CNTs 

on which the HMIM treatment was applied, no significant thickness increase of the layer could be 

observed. Thus, a transformation of the ZnO film can definitely be argued. Although similar 

parameters (thickness of initial ZnO thin films, treatment temperature and duration etc.) were kept 

similar, the integration of imidazolate linkers by the HMIM and transformation into a MOF could not 

be demonstrated. In an effort to force a vapor-solid transformation the exposure temperature was 

increased to 130 °C and humid conditions by additional H2O injection were employed. The idea for 

this attempt was based on the findings of Stassen that a temperature increase from 115 °C to 130 °C 

and a humid N2 flow facilitated the transformation reaction in a mixture of ZnO and HMIM powder 

as shown in Figure 45.

flow humidified to 33% relative humidity (right). Taken from Stassen et al.30 

 

In the presented graphs the weight fractions of forming ZIF-8 increase sigmoidally with exposure 

time. However, even with the intensified exposure parameters and an effective exposure time of 80 min 

no evidence for a film conversion was observed by comparing SEM images and EDX spectra before 

and after the HMIM exposure as shown in Figure 46 and Figure 47.

In Figure 46 c) the Zn and O signals diminish in the EDX spectra and the top-view SEM image 

(Figure 46 b) shows no contrast after exposure. The SEM image after exposure looks like the image 

of a bare Si(100) substrate as seen in Figure 27. In Raman spectroscopy of the exposed samples (not 

shown here) only a characteristic Raman band at 520 cm-1 of the used Si substrate was detected.96 The 

GIXRD diffractogram (not shown here) of the exposed film showed a weak intensity ZnO pattern 

similar to the one for a 50 ALD cycles ZnO film that was shown in Figure 39. No characteristic ZIF-

8 peaks as reported by Stassen et al., were observed.30

Also in Figure 47 diminishing EDX signals for Zn and O are observed after exposure. Furthermore, 

in the SEM images the light contrast of the heavy Zn on the N-CNTs is reduced after exposure. 

Evaluating Figure 46 and Figure 47, it can be even assumed that the HMIM/H2O treatment removes 

the ZnO film rather than transforms it.  However, the results of Stassen could not be reproduced. 

It has to be mentioned that the here used injection of HMIM and H2O into the reactor chamber was 

done in a cycled manner and interrupted by intermediate purging due to the used ALD reactor. This 

is fundamentally different to Stassen’s work, where the ZnO thin film sample was suspended top-down,

5 cm above a heated bed of HMIM powder. Hence, the ZnO films were continuously exposed to the 

HMIM vapor. Stassen et al., strongly emphasize on the necessity of a continuous transformation 

reaction, because experiments with halted and resumed HMIM exposure showed decreased fractions 

of transformed ZIF-8 compared to a continuous treatment. Stassen relates this observation with a 

suggested conversion mechanism, in which an important role is given to the water during the 

neutralization reaction.30 Water is assumed to retain at the transformation interface and keeping the 

MOF building blocks mobile for framework self-assembly. Moreover, the liquid-like character might 

enable the protonation of the organic linker and hydratation of the ZnO. In this hypothesis, a halted 

transformation could lead to dehydration and immobilization of the surface layer and prevent a 

restarted reaction. In conclusion, this could explain that no conversion was observed due to the cyclic 

exposure by HMIM pulses in this work. 

 

8.3.2 MOF-MLD by DEZ and HMIM 

In addition to the reproduction of a 2-step MOF-CVD route a direct ALD/MLD method towards 

producing a ZIF-8 MOF was tried. The sequential injection of DEZ and HMIM aiming at a bottom-

up thin film formation was expected to adequately exploit the ability of the here used ALD reactor in 

contrast to the MOF-CVD route. Furthermore, the finding of a direct gas-phase route was more in 

the scope of this work than a 2-step strategy depending on a post-treatment. However, neither on 

Si(100) nor on N-CNTs a significant thin film deposition by DEZ/HMIM injection or in the three 

precursor route DEZ/HMIM/H2O could be observed in SEM images. In case of the deposition 

attempts on N-CNTs (not shown here) weak Zn signals were found and in a subsequent STEM/EDX 

analysis small evidence was found for nucleation. A corresponding secondary electron STEM image 

is shown in Figure 48. The light contrast seen on the nanotubes could be a sign for nucleation. Further 

XPS studies could clarify if a successful N-Zn linkage characteristic for a ZIF-8 was achieved. 

Nevertheless, Raman spectra yielded no characteristic bands apart from the characteristic N-CNT 

signal and the two attempted processes seem not to yield a significant coating given the STEM image.

8.4 Direct routes towards terephthalate hybrid thin films 

In this chapter experimental works towards producing terephthalate hybrid thin films are presented. 

ALD/MLD deposition of the organic precursor terephthalic acid (TPA) in combination with the metal 

sources DEZ was studied and attempted with Eu(TMHD)3, aiming at a luminescent hybrid film. 

Eventually, Zn-terephthalate (Zn-TP) hybrid thin films could be successfully synthesized on Si(100), 

Si/SiO2 and N-CNT substrates. FTIR measurements confirmed the bonding between the organic 

bicarboxylate and the Zn. Eu-TP thin films could not be synthesized up to now.  

The motivation for using TPA lies in the fact, that TPA is an easily available and commonly utilized 

organic precursor for hybrid frameworks due to its rigid aromatic structure and thermostability. For 

instance, terephthalate linkers interconnect the inorganic ZnO4 units in the prototypic MOF-5 

structure as shown in Figure 11. In terms of chemical composition the use of DEZ/TPA justifies an 

attempt to potentially synthesize a MOF-5 or similar hybrid structure in an ALD/MLD deposition. 

In related studies DEZ was used together with the also bifunctional phenol hydroquinone to create 

superlattice structures with potential application as thermoelectrics. 97-99 ZnO interdispersed with 

single layers of hydroquinone and variable ZnO-hydroquinone layer ratios were reported. Moreover, 

in works by Klepper et al., amorphous organic-inorganic hybrid thin films were formed by the widely 

used organometallic precursor trimethylaluminium (TMA) together with TPA among other various 

linear and aromatic carboxylic acids.87, 100-102  



 

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 67 

8.4.1 ALD/MLD by DEZ and TPA  

Deposition of thin films by use of DEZ and TPA precursors was demonstrated on various substrates 

like Si(100), Si with thermal oxide (Si/SiO2) and N-CNTs in order to investigate the film formation 

and nucleation behaviour on different surfaces. A first remarkable feature of the thin film samples in 

this chapter was the observation of view angle dependent coloration as shown in Figure 49. This was 

different compared to the ZnO film samples that were deposited in previous experiments and is related 

to the comparably larger film thickness. The coloration can be explained with optical interference 

effects of the thin films in the visible region of light, which is for instance dependent on the film 

thickness. For instance, this property was exploited in solution-processed ZIF-8 based Fabry-Pérot 

devices reported by Lu103 and shows the versatility of applications for MOF in the field of thin film 

optics. The function principle of the reported selective chemical vapor sensor devices used changes in 

the refractive index and interference properties upon gas adsorption in the open framework structure. 

However, this example is a side note for this work. As presented in the following the Zn-TP thin films 

deposited at various temperatures were extensively characterized by SEM/EDX, GIXRD, FTIR, UV-

Vis and AFM.

Si(100) and Si/SiO2 substrates at different temperatures. Some samples were broken for cross-section analysis 

in SEM. 

 

8.4.1.1 SEM/EDX/STEM of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films 

In Figure 50 SEM images with top-views and cross-sections of thin films deposited at 200 °C by 300 

ALD/MLD cycles of DEZ/TPA. Images for deposition on Si/SiO2 and Si(100) substrates are shown 

for comparison. In the top-views of the films a flake-like morphology can be observed for the film 

forming on Si/SiO2, whereas a needle-like morphology is observed for the film forming on Si(100). 

The cross-section reveals a significantly higher film thickness of 195 nm for deposition on the Si/SiO2 

substrate compared to the 118 nm thickness in case of the Si(100) substrate. The comparison reveals 

the influence of the substrate type for thin film growth and indicates that Si/SiO2 seems to promote 

the film nucleation by enhanced chemisorption.

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 69 

Considering the number of cycles and film thickness, the GPC for thin films deposited at several 

temperatures can be easily approximated from the SEM cross-sections. In case of the thin film grown 

on Si/SiO2 at 200 °C, a GPC of 6.5 Å can be determined.  Compared to inorganic metal oxides like 

ZnO with the demonstrated GPC of 1.9 Å, this is a remarkably high value and is a strong indication 

that the organic terephthalate moiety was incorporated into the film. Salmi et al., used zinc acetate 

(ZnAc2) and TPA as precursors and report a similar GPC of 6.5 Å at 225 °C for as-deposited 

amorphous films.37  

In Figure 51 GPCs determined from film thickness of Zn-TP films are shown for various 

temperatures. The data from Salmi et al., is given as a reference. These workers observed an increasing 

trend for the GPC with decreasing deposition temperature and related this to TPA condensation. 

Precursor condensation increases the GPC as shown in Figure 6 in the ALD/MLD theory part. In 

other works of Karppinen TPA condensation was also assumed to induce a CVD-like character of the 

ALD/MLD process. The here reported value for DEZ/TPA deposition on Si/SiO2 fits to the data of 

Salmi. Surprisingly, thin films deposited below 200 °C seem not to follow the trend of increasing GPC 

with decreasing temperature. In order to draw a conclusion more data is needed for a complete study 

of the here reported ALD/MLD process. However, the deposition temperature has an important 

influence on the GPC. Figure 52 shows top-view SEM images for hybrid thin films deposited on 

Si(100) at various temperatures. It can be observed that the varying deposition temperatures also lead 

to different surface morphologies. This could also be related to different film thicknesses and growth 

stages. From 150 °C to 200 °C the grains develop from granular to needle-like morphology. For 250 

°C a fine-grained structure evolves. All the here observed morphologies for deposition on Si(100) look 

different compared to the flake-like morphology for deposition on Si/SiO2 as previously shown in 

Figure 50 a). In summary, the substrate and deposition temperature influence the film growth in terms 

of thickness and surface morphology. 

Apart from deposition on flat Si and Si/SiO2 substrates, the SEM and STEM images in Figure 53 and 

Figure 54 demonstrate the successful growth of thin films on N-CNTs. From the STEM image the 

film thickness can be deduced film to be around 23 nm for 300 ALD/MLD cycles. The excellent 

conformality and uniformity of the Zn-TP hybrid thin films is highlighted. The ALD/MLD process 

is an ideal technique for fabrication of various organic-inorganic hybrid thin films regardless the 

geometry of the substrate and therefore the design of novel functional materials that involve micro- 

or nanoscale control of dimensions.

8.4.1.2 AFM of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films 

AFM measurements of randomly chosen sample areas of a Zn-TP hybrid thin film deposited by 

300 ALD/MLD cycles at 200 °C. Images of scanning areas 5 µm x 5 µm and 0.5 µm x 0.5 µm are 

presented in Figure 55 and corresponding RMS roughness values are given in Table 14. The images 

show a rough surface with island-like grown granules with appearing voids in between them. This is 

in accordance to studies of Karppinen et al.,36, 50, 51 in which the high roughness was related to the 

crystalline nature of the thin films. In the work of Karppinen et al., surface roughness was determined 

by XRR measurements with reported values of 7 to 8 nm for Cu-TP (MOF-2) and 6 nm for Ca-TP. 

However, Karppinen et al., report entirely crystalline hybrid films, whereas here only ZnO as a 

crystalline component was proven in the thin films as shown in the subsequent chapter 8.4.1.3. Despite 

of the different number of ALD cycles, the AFM studies reveal that the as-prepared Zn-TP hybrid film 

present distinct surface morphology features that are different compared to the ZnO film (chapter 

8.2.4), which can be due to the incorporation of the organic component.

8.4.1.3 GIXRD of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films 

Diffractograms of thin films deposited by DEZ and TPA at 200 °C are shown in Figure 56 and Figure 

57. For MOFs it is common to see diffraction peaks at low 2? angles below 20° due to the large unit 

cells. Such peaks are not visible in Figure 56 and also not in another scan with lower step size in a low 

angle range as double-checked in Figure 57, neither on Si(100) nor on Si/SiO2 substrates. Thus, no 

crystalline MOF-5 or related structure with large unit cell was directly deposited from the vapor-

phase. This is in analogy to the work of Salmi et al., in which an as-deposited thin film was of amorphous 

nature.37 However, by a 2-step post-treatment with a first crystallization step in humid conditions 

followed by second solvothermal DMF treatment in an autoclave a recrystallization into MOF-5 was 

achieved. This indicates that an as-deposited amorphous framework already exists, but has to be 

stabilized by introduction of molecules into the pore interior.37, 38 Such a post-treatment of the here 

deposited Zn-TP films could be part of further studies. However, a single-step gas phase method 

towards a crystalline hybrid would be much more interesting from a technological point of view. In 

another work of Karppinen et al., a narrow deposition temperature window between 180 and 190 °C is 

reported for direct deposition of crystalline Cu-TP (MOF-2),36 which could motivate a more detailed 

GIXRD study of ALD/MLD deposited Zn-TP at several temperatures in the follow-up of this work.

Interestingly, the diffractogram exhibits a diffraction pattern that matches with the hexagonal 

wurtzite ZnO pattern, earlier seen in chapter 8.2.3. This proves that the thin film contains crystalline 

ZnO, but GIXRD can make no conclusion about possible coexisting amorphous phases that do not 

appear in a diffractogram. Diffraction patterns of ZnO were seen by Salmi et al., only after 

decomposition of MOF-5 thin films at temperatures as high as 400 °C, but could evidence a conversion 

mechanisms that also played a role in the vapor-solid transformation of ZnO into ZIF-8 reported by 

Stassen et al.30 In a related study Hermes et al., formed ZnO@MOF-5 nanocomposites on purpose by 

loading the open framework by penetration and hydrolysis of DEZ inside the pore interior. These 

examples point out the complex chemistry involved. At this state the exact structure and composition 

of the here deposited Zn-terephthalate films stays unclear. Nevertheless, from here it is still probable 

that the film exhibits a hybrid nature, for instance by coexistence of amorphous Zn-terephthalate and 

crystalline ZnO in a hybrid film. For identification of the organic moiety and the linkage towards Zn 

further FTIR spectroscopy was performed in the subsequent chapter 8.4.1.4.   



 

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 75 

8.4.1.4 FTIR of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films 

In order to prove the existence of an organic-inorganic hybrid, the presence of the terephthalate in the 

thin film and its coordination towards the Zn was investigated in FTIR. Figure 58 shows the 

corresponding FTIR spectrum in transmittance for thin films deposited by DEZ and TPA at 150, 175 

and 200 °C and for a film that formed during several depositions on the reactor wall.  

 

 

Figure 58: FTIR spectra of Zn-TP hybrid thin films deposited by 400 ALD/MLD cycles at various temperatures 

(150, 175, 200 °C) on KBr pellets. A Zn-TP film that formed on the chamber wall was also analyzed. A TPA 

spectrum is given as reference and band assignments are given according to Yadav.67 An inset of the interesting 

region of carboxylate stretching vibrations is given in Figure 59 below.  
 

The interesting region is between around 1300 and 1700 cm-1 (Figure 59), where the symmetric (?s) 

and asymmetric (?as) carboxylate (COO-) stretching vibrations can be found.37 After Yadav these 

stretching vibrations are generally located between 1300 and 1400 cm-1 (?s) and between 1550 and 

1650 cm-1 (?as), respectively. 67 The COO--Zn bond can be either of type I (unidentate), type II 

(bidentate) or type III (bridging) according to Table 15. The type is determined from the 

characteristic splitting ??= ?as – ?s. For all the Zn-TP hybrid films the symmetric stretching can be 

clearly found at around 1385 cm-1. For the asymmetric stretching several absorption bands at 1508, 

1543 and 1560 cm-1 can be considered for the films deposited at 175 and 200 °C. The film deposited at 

150 °C does not yield sharp bands. However, the found bands lead to splittings ?? that are

The results are summarized in Table 16 and compared with FTIR studies of other ALD/MLD 

processed terephthalate hybrids reported by Karppinen et al.,36, 50, 51 and the MOF-5 structure reported 

by Salmi et al.37 Further analysis of the FTIR spectra reveals bands in the range between 2500 and 

3000 cm-1, that are characteristic for -OH stretching.67 The existence of these bands in the thin films 

could be an indication for inclusions of unreacted TPA precursor in the film, possibly due to 

condensation at the here utilized low deposition temperatures. Furthermore, Li et al., explained a band 

at 1636 cm-1 with H2O adsorption on ZnO, which can also be found here. The absorption bands at 

around 415 cm-1 in Figure 58 can be attributed to a Zn-O stretching vibration. As reference 

Salmi et al.,37 report a Zn-O stretch at 520 cm-1 and Civalleri49 at 511 cm-1 in a MOF-5 structure. 

However, it was reported in studies about ZnO particles that the position of these Zn-O bands 

underlies a strong dependence on shape morphology of the ZnO particles and can appear in a broad 

range between roughly 400 and 500 cm-1.104, 105 In particular, IR spectra exhibited characteristic bands 

around 420 cm-1 in correspondence to the here found result. This is also an indication for the 

coexistence of ZnO particles in the here reported thin films. With decreasing deposition temperature 

this absorption evolves to be more intense. This could be related to the different film morphologies

In conclusion, the FTIR characterization of the thin films deposited by DEZ and TPA confirmed the 

hybrid Zn-terephthalate linkage. Herein, the FTIR analysis is supported by literature findings about 

similar hybrid structures examining the typical bands of carboxylate stretching vibrations. As matter 

of fact, this type of Zn-TP hybrid films can exhibit distinctive properties in contrast to their inorganic 

counterparts due to the inclusion of organic components.

8.4.1.5 UV-Vis of Zn-terephthalate hybrid films 

In Figure 60 the UV-Vis spectra of Zn-TP hybrid films are given that were deposited at 150, 175 and 

200 °C. The graphs were corrected by the absorption contribution of the substrates. For all of them a 

sharp absorption edge can be observed from which the bandgap can be determined from a Tauc-plot. 

The intersection of the extrapolated linear regimes with the horizontal axis results in an optical 

bandgap Eg?3.2 eV. The ZnO reference film shows a bandgap of around 3.1 eV. These values are in 

agreement with the 3.1 to 3.3 eV reported elsewhere for the bandgap of ZnO.106 Apart from the GIXRD 

and FTIR results the presented UV-Vis spectra are another clear evidence for the presence of ZnO in 

the hybrid films. Moreover, it can be observed that with decreasing deposition temperature the 

absorption intensity increases. This trend was also observed for the Zn-O absorption bands in the 

FTIR analysis in the previous chapter 8.4.1.4 and could be related to the different observed 

morphologies seen in the SEM. Changing optical properties of ZnO thin films with different 

morphologies and textures were also reported by Chiang et al.92 It can also be assumed, that the unclear 

reaction mechanism leading to ZnO formation is more pronounced at lower temperatures. 

Nevertheless, it remains challenging to provide direct experimental evidence confirming the structural 

ordering of organic and inorganic moieties in the hybrid thin film.

RESULTS &amp;amp; DISCUSSION 79 

8.4.2 ALD/MLD by Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA 

As described in the experimental part, this attempt followed closely the previous works from 

Giedraityte in which the successful deposition of luminescent, lanthanide hybrid thin films was 

demonstrated on Si(100).52 Although the same precursors Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA and similar process 

parameters with even extended precursor pulsing times were utilized, up to now, no hybrid film was 

obtained with the here used setup. In SEM images no film deposition, neither on Si(100), Si/SiO2 nor 

on N-CNTs, was visible and a fluorescence test under UV light (365 nm and 254 nm), being suitable 

for excitation of the Eu absorption, was negative.  

The work by Giedraityte shows the principle feasibility of this precursor combination leading to 

amorphous hybrid films. Nevertheless, a challenge of this system are to evaporate sufficient amounts 

of two solid precursors and transporting them through the gas tubing into the reactor chamber where 

they have to react. Thus, a fundamental issue, e.g. a lack of gaseous precursor arriving to the substrate 

surface, can be assumed and could explain that no film formation was observed. As the previous 

experiments using TPA (chapter 8.4.1) were successful, the issues seem to be related to the evaporation 

and transport of the Eu(TMHD)3 precursor.





 

SUMMARY 81 

9 Summary 

In a first theoretical part of this work an introduction into ALD and MLD was given. Then, recent 

advances in the application of vapor-based synthesis methods for inorganic-organic hybrids, and in 

particular MOFs, were reviewed and motivations explained. In summary of this review, two decades 

with mostly solution based approaches towards MOF formation have been able to synthesize a large 

variety of different structures with manifold applications in wide-spanning fields from gas adsorption 

to biomedical usage in drug release. Furthermore, a key trend is seen in the microelectronic industry 

for device integration of organic-inorganic hybrid materials like MOFs. According to this, roadmaps 

have been formulated in 2011 and have recently been updated in 2017.3, 31 However, the important step 

towards implementation of these hybrid materials could not be adequately addressed by conventional, 

solution-based synthesis routes. Vapor-phase techniques, such as ALD/MLD, have therefore caught 

great attention and are seen as the key to answer the high demands of the electronic industry. 

Remarkable first attempts have been already done and were reviewed here30, 35, 36, but this research is 

just in the beginning phase and needs much feasibility assessment in finding well-behaving precursor 

pairs, understanding of process parameters and growth mechanisms in the field of organic-inorganic 

hybrid thin films. The step towards crystalline organic-inorganic hybrid structures has only been 

reported by a handful of publications. Therefore this topic offers great research potential and, in 

particular, for finding a direct ALD/MLD route towards MOFs. 

 

In the experimental part of this work, firstly, a step back to ALD deposition of purely inorganic ZnO 

was done. The common precursors H2O and diethylzinc (DEZ) were utilized. These early stage 

experiments had a learning process as primary objective. A fundamental understanding of the ALD 

technique was obtained by a well-established system and first experience with the here used, home-

built ALD reactor was gathered. Eventually, ZnO deposition was demonstrated on various substrates, 

such as flat Si(100) wafers or the more complex geometries of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon 

nanotubes (N-MWCNTs). Hence, the ability of ALD to produce conformal coatings and the 

compatibility with the high demands of the microelectronic industry were shown. The evolution of 

ZnO film growth for different ALD cycles was imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 

the growth-per-cycle (GPC) of the process was deduced from thickness measurements by means of X-

ray Reflectivity (XRR). A GPC of 1.9 Å was found to be in excellent accordance to literature results. 

Homogeneous ZnO film composition was shown in elemental mappings by Energy-Dispersive X-ray 

Spectroscopy (EDX). Furthermore, a structural analysis of the polycrystalline thin films was 

conducted by Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) and obtained typical diffraction patterns 

of the hexagonal wurtzite structure with lattice parameters of a = 3.25 ± 0.03 Å and c = 5.21 ± 0.04 Å. 

The films deposited at 100 °C showed no preferential grain orientation. However, it was found in 

literature that control over the film morphology and growth of textured films is possible by variation 



 

SUMMARY 82 

of the deposition temperature. Driven by the interest of the opto-electronic industry a lot of studies 

exist to tune the optical properties of ZnO thin films. Peak width analysis of the GIXRD diffractograms 

and application of the Scherrer equation yielded a crystallite size of around 15 nm. Finally, a RMS film 

roughness of 7.4 nm was determined from AFM measurements (5 µm x 5µm image). Besides the ZnO 

deposition on Si(100), the conformal coating of N-CNTs was observed in SEM and Scanning 

Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) images.  

 

After the successful ZnO deposition experiments it was returned to the initial aim of this work, that is 

to demonstrate a vapor-phase route for the synthesis of a MOF. In a first attempt, and following the 

pioneering work of Stassen et al.,30 the previously acquired ZnO thin films were now exposed to HMIM 

vapor with the objective to initiate a solid-vapor transformation into ZIF-8. Several vapor treatments 

inside the ALD reactor were tested by evaporating solid HMIM in the heated canisters and injecting 

the HMIM vapor into the reactor chamber onto the ZnO samples in a sequential manner. Even longer 

treatment durations up to 80 min compared to the 30 min reported by Stassen, exposure temperatures 

up to 130 °C and humid conditions, that were proposed to facilitate the transformation, did not lead to 

an evidence for a vapor-solid reaction in SEM, EDX, Raman and GIXRD studies. It was emphasized 

that the continuous MOF-CVD character by direct gas exposure from a HMIM powder bed as 

reported by Stassen could not be reproduced by the sequential exposure character, given the here used 

ALD reactor. In another attempt the bottom-up formation of ZIF-8 by a sequential ALD/MLD 

process with the precursors DEZ as Zn source and HMIM for the imidazolate linkages was studied. 

To our knowledge this route has not been reported before for ZIF-8 and the capability of the used 

reactor for sequential precursor injection and hence an ALD/MLD route in contrast to the MOF-

CVD route seemed more suitable. Nevertheless, the attempted deposition on N-CNTs showed only 

minor signs for nucleation in an STEM/EDX analysis, but no significant film deposition. Raman 

spectroscopy for deposition trials on N-CNTs and Si(100) yielded no characteristic bands apart from 

the substrate signals. In conclusion, both routes towards a ZIF-8 MOF did not the lead to the aspired 

goal. 

 

Furthermore, the direct ALD/MLD deposition of terephthalate (TP) thin films was targeted like it 

had already been demonstrated before by Karppinen et al., for crystalline Cu-TP (MOF-2), Ca-TP and 

Li-TP films. In this work, it was aimed at Zn-TP thin films deposited by the precursors diethylzinc 

(DEZ) and terephthalic acid (TPA). Potentially, growth of a MOF structure could have been expected 

given the precursors that contain the MOF-5 components for Zn nodes and terephthalate linkers. A 

high film growth rate of about 6.5 Å/cycle at 200 °C deposition temperature was observed by film 

thickness measurements from a SEM cross-section. Evidence for organic-inorganic linkage between 

the terephthalate and Zn of bridging type was proven in FTIR measurements and demonstrated the 

hybrid nature of the film. However, peaks at low 2? angles below 20°, that would be typical for a MOF-

5 or related hybrid structure, were not observed in GIXRD. Interestingly, the as-deposited Zn-TP 

film contained crystalline ZnO as proven by GIXRD measurements. The presence of ZnO in the films 

was further proven by the appearance of Zn-O stretching bands in FTIR spectra and an absorption 

edge in UV-Vis indicating a ZnO bandgap at 3.2 eV. Assumably, the deposited thin films are hybrid 

layers of amorphous Zn-TP hybrid and ZnO nanocrystallites and could be understood as a 

nanocomposite, but the exact structural ordering of organic and inorganic components remains a 

challenge. For further clarification, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) could reveal the chemical 

bonding states. Moreover, Rutherford backscattering (RBS) or nuclear reaction analysis (NMR) were 

used by Mai et al.,53 to determine the composition of ALD/MLD hybrid films. 

 

Finally, ALD/MLD thin film deposition with the precursors Eu(TMHD)3 and TPA was attempted. 

Up to now, no film deposition could be observed and showing once more that simple film formation in 

vapor-phase synthesis is already a huge challenge for the experimental setup. Anyhow, previous works 

by other authors using these precursors are promising and, prospectively, thin film deposition of 

luminescent lanthanide containing hybrids, e.g. LnMOFs, is an ultimate goal that should be targeted 

in further studies. For this, upgrades of the home-built ALD reactor for better evaporation and 

transport of the precursors to the reactor chamber might be needed, as well as setup improvements for 

higher working temperatures.





 

CONCLUSION &amp;amp; OUTLOOK 85 

10 Conclusions &amp;amp; Outlook 

The main achievement of this work is a review of the current state of vapor-based processing of 

organic-inorganic hybrids, and potentially MOFs, referring to recent publications in this very young 

research field. It was emphasized on the already existing expertise of some leading groups for handling 

ALD/MLD for several systems of hybrid thin films. In this sense, the activities of the Karppinen group 

have to be highlighted and were taken as a role model for this work several times and show the 

importance of a year-long experience in ALD/MLD and deep understanding of the chemistry behind.  

 

The development of models for reaction mechanisms will be an important step to control the formation 

of hybrid structures from the vapor phase. It has to be pointed out that the challenge emerges from 

the fundamental difference of vapor phase methods compared to liquid phase methods, in which many 

organic reactions are catalysed by acid, base or solvation effects. These necessary mechanisms are 

absent in a gas phase environment and make self-assembly processes difficult. Furthermore, it can be 

assumed that the vapor deposition leads to collapsed structures as frameworks are not stabilized during 

the layer-by-layer formation in ALD/MLD sequences. Organic linkers might bend and prevent an 

ordered bottom-up formation of a crystalline structure. However, it was discussed in this work, that 

liquid-like mobilization layers induced by humid environments could also play a role for vapor phase 

deposition methods. 

 

Various experimental approaches based on several precursor combinations have been undertaken in 

this work. However, no crystalline, porous MOF could be synthesized as initially targeted for this 

project. It will be interesting to see in the future if direct vapor-phase processes can be mastered in a 

controlled manner for a wide range of hybrid thin films, such as superlattices, luminescent coatings or 

crystalline, porous MOF structures. In particular, the class of lanthanide MOFs by choice of well 

adapted organic linkers as luminescence sensitizers is highly promising. The establishment of an 

ALD/MLD route for high quality films could steer towards device integration of hybrid materials 

with manifold applications in micro- and optoelectronics.
