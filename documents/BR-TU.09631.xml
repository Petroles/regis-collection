ABSTRACT 

MÁRMOL, G. Low-alkalinity matrix composites based on magnesium oxide cement reinforced with 

cellulose fibers. 2017. 160 p. Thesis (Doctorate) - Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, 

Universidade de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. 

A lower-alkalinity cement based on MgO and SiO2 blends is analysed to develop clinker-free Fibre 

Reinforced Cementitious Composites (FRCC) with cellulosic fibres in order to solve the durability problems 

of this type of fibres when used in FRCC with Portland cement. Hydration evolution from 7 to 28 days of 

different MgO-SiO2 formulations is assessed. The main hydration products are Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels for 

all  the formulations studied regardless of age. Hardened pastes are obtained with pH values &amp;lt;11 and 

good mechanical properties compared to conventional Portland cement. 60% MgO-40% SiO2 system is 

chosen as optimal for the development FRCC since is the most mechanical resistant and is less alkaline 

compared with 70% MgO-30% SiO2. FRCC based on magnesium oxide and silica (MgO-SiO2) cement with 

cellulose fibres are produced to study the durability of lignocellulosic fibres in a lower pH environment 

than the ordinary Portland cement (PC). Flexural performance and physical tests (apparent porosity, bulk 

density and water absorption) of samples at 28 days and after 200 accelerated ageing cycles (aac) are 

compared. Two types of vegetable fibres are utilised: eucalyptus and pine pulps. MgO-SiO2 cement 

preserves cellulosic fibres integrity after ageing, so composites made out of MgO-SiO2 exhibit significant 

higher performance after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing than Portland cement composites. High CO2 

concentration environment is evaluated as a curing treatment in order to optimise MgO- SiO2 matrices in 

FRCC. Samples are cured under two different conditions: 1) steam water curing at 55oC and 2) a 

complementary high CO2 concentration (20% by volume). In carbonated samples, Mg(OH)2 content is 

clearly lowered while new crystals of hydromagnesite [Mg5(CO3)4·(OH)2·4H2O] are produced. After 

carbonation, M-S-H gel content is also reduced, suggesting that this phase is also carbonated. Carbonation 

affects positively to the composite mechanical strength and physical properties with no deleterious effects 

after ageing since it increases matrix rigidity. The addition of sepiolite in FRCC is studied as a possible 

additive constituent of the binding matrix. Small cement replacement (1 and 2% wt.) by sepiolite is 

introduced and studied in hardened cement pastes and, later, in FRCC systems. When used only in cement 

pastes, it improves Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity over time. Bending tests prove the outcome of this 

additive on the mechanical performance of the composite: it improves composite homogeneity. Ageing 

effects are reported after embedding sisal fibres in MgO-SiO2 and PC systems and submitting them to 

different ageing conditions. This comparative study of fibre degradation applied in different cementitious 



 

 

matrices reveals the real compatibility of lignocellulosic fibres and Mg-based cements. Sisal fibres, even 

after accelerated ageing, do neither suffer a significant reduction in cellulose content nor in cellulose 

crystallinity and crystallite size, when exposed to MgO-SiO2 cement. Fibre integrity is preserved and no 

deposition of cement phases is produced in MgO-SiO2 environment. 

 

Keywords: MgO-SiO2 binder; Low-alkalinity cementitious composite; Cellulose; Durability; Carbonation. 



 

 

RESUMO 

MÁRMOL, G. Compósitos de baixa alcalinidade à base de óxido de magnésio reforçados com fibras de 

celulose. 2017. 160 p. Tese (Doutorado) - Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, 

Universidade de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2017. 

Um cimento de baixa alcalinidade à base de blendas de MgO e SiO2 é analisado para o desenvolvimento 

de Compósitos Cimentícios Reforçados com Fibras (CCRF) celulósicas sem clínquer para resolver os 

problemas de durabilidade de este tipo de fibras quando são usadas em CCRF com cimento Portland. A 

evolução da hidratação, desde 7 aos 28 dias, das diferentes formulações é avaliada. Os principais produtos 

hidratados são o Mg(OH)2 e o gel M-S-H para todas as formulações independentemente da idade estudada. 

As pastas endurecidas apresentam valores de pH &amp;lt;11 e bom desempenho mecânico comparado com o 

cimento Portland convencional. O sistema 60% MgO-40% SiO2 é escolhido como a formulação ótima para 

o desenvolvimento de CCRF já que é a mais resistente e menos alcalina comparada com 70% MgO-30% 

SiO2. CCRF com cimento à base de óxido de magnésio e sílica (MgO-SiO2) e fibras celulósicas são produzidos 

para a análise da durabilidade das fibras lignocelulósicas em ambientes com valores de pH mais baixos 

comparados com o cimento Portland (PC). O desempenho mecânico a flexão e os ensaios físicos 

(porosidade aparente, densidade aparente e absorção de água) são comparados aos 28 dias e após de 200 

ciclos de envelhecimento acelerado. O cimento à base de MgO-SiO2 preserva a integridade das fibras após 

o envelhecimento. Os compósitos produzidos com este cimento exibem melhores propriedades após 200 

ciclos de envelhecimento acelerado que os compósitos produzidos com cimento Portland. Ambientes com 

alta concentração de CO2 são avaliados como tratamento de cura para otimizar as matrizes MgO- SiO2 nos 

CCRF. As amostras são curadas sob 2 condições diferençadas: 1) cura com vapor de água a 55oC e 2) cura 

com alta concentração de CO2 (20% do volume). As amostras carbonatadas apresentam teores reduzidos 

de Mg(OH)2 enquanto é produzida uma nova fase cristalina: hidromagnesita [Mg5(CO3)4·(OH)2·4H2O]. Após 

a carbonatação, o conteúdo de gel M-S-H é reduzido também, indicando uma carbonatação desta fase. A 

carbonatação aumenta a rigidez da matriz o que influi positivamente no desempenho mecânico e as 

propriedades físicas dos compósitos sem efeitos prejudiciais ao longo prazo. A adição de sepiolita em CCRF 

é estudada como possível adição na composição da matriz aglomerante. Baixos teores (1 e 2% em massa) 

de cimento são substituídos por sepiolita para o estudo das pastas de cimento hidratado e, 

posteriormente, dos compósitos. O Módulo Elástico Dinâmico das pastas é incrementado com o tempo 

pela adição de sepiolita. Os ensaios a flexão demostram que a adição de sepiolita melhora a 

homogeneidade dos compósitos. Reportam-se os efeitos das fibras de sisal após da exposição a sistemas 



 

 

MgO-SiO2 e PC e submetidas a diferentes condições de envelhecimento. Este estudo comparativo da 

degradação das fibras expostas a diferentes matrizes cimentícias mostra a compatibilidade das fibras 

lignocelulósicas com os cimentos à base de Mg. As fibras de sisal, inclusive após o envelhecimento 

acelerado, não apresentam nem redução significativa no conteúdo de celulose nem na cristalinidade da 

celulose assim como do tamanho de cristalito, quando expostas a cimentos MgO-SiO2. 

Palavras-chave: Cimento MgO-SiO2; Compósitos cimentícios de baixa alcalinidade; Celulose; Durabilidade; 

Carbonatação.

1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1 IMPORTANCE AND INNOVATION OF THE WORK 

Composite materials are a key solution for universal challenges in terms of materials 

engineering and science. A composite material, also called composite, is a solid material that results 

when more than one substance, each with its own characteristics, are combined to create a new 

substance whose properties are superior to those of the original components in a specific 

application (ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA, 2013). Remarkable properties of composites may be 

achieved by embedding fibres of one substance in a host matrix of another. That is the case of fibre-

reinforced composites (FRC). 

While the structural value of a bundle of fibres is low, the strength of individual fibres can 

be harnessed if they are embedded in a matrix that acts as an adhesive. Therefore, fibres impart 

structural strength to the composite, while the matrix protects the fibres from environmental stress 

and physical damage and imparts thermal stability to them. The fibre-matrix combination also 

reduces the potential for a complete fracture; if one fibre fails cracking may not extend to other 

fibres, whereas a crack that starts in a monolithic (or single) material generally continues to 

propagate until that material fails (ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA, 2013). 

The most used composite in the construction industry, sector within the scope of this 

research, is reinforced concrete. However, this work focuses on those materials formed by a 

hydraulic cementitious matrix and various discreetly incorporated aggregates and discontinuous 

fibres: Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Composites (FRCC). 

Sustainability is a growing worldwide concern in view of the limited natural resources, 

energy production, wastes disposal and polluting gases emissions. The use of regional agro-

industrial residues is a smart strategy to save energy in order to attend the global construction 

market. Ligno-cellulose pulp and vegetable fibre from several agro-industrial processes may also be 

an alternative solution for durable fibre-cement products and consequently more sustainable 

materials (ARDANUY; CLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015). At the same time, the use of 

lignocellulosic fibres presents an attractive potential for tropical countries in Africa and South 

America since their availability of quality materials that allow the manufacture of building elements 

at low cost. It also allows the development of a competent industry, with the possibility of 

international trade (SAVASTANO JR; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2003). In fact, with the development and

evolution of the Hatschek technology, cellulose fibres have been traditionally used to retain fine 

particles during the manufacturing process of fibre-cement products. 

Despite the advantages of using vegetable fibres as reinforcement in FRCC, a significant 

drawback has been widely reported: the durability of composites. Contrarily to what happens with 

synthetic fibres, i.e. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polypropylene (PP), mechanical and physical 

integrity of vegetable fibres are affected within the calcium based cement matrices. Under these 

circumstances, in porous alkaline environments (pH&gt; 12), cellulose based fibres are degraded 

progressively, losing all its reinforcing performance. At this point is where research on new FRCC 

must find a compromise solution, avoiding excessive energy costs that cause the production of 

synthetic fibres and the limited durability offered by lignocellulosic fibres. 

Literature regarding this loss of mechanical properties of vegetable fibres over time in 

Portland cement (PC) based FRCC claims that dissolution and decomposition of hemicellulose and 

lignin takes place. Thus, the cohesion between the individual fibres is broken at micro and macro 

scale. This breakdown is produced by the attack of (OH)- ions from the calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] 

solutions over hemicellulose and lignin molecules. Another detrimental effect on the mechanical 

performance of the lignocellulosic fibres is the crystallization thereof. This phenomenon in PC based 

FRCC occurs when cellulose chains are surrounded by Ca2+ cations from Ca(OH)2 formed after 

calcium silicates hydration (C-S-H). 

Traditionally, two strategies have been proposed to preserve cellulose-based fibres In FRCC: 

1. Reduction of the amount of Ca(OH)2 solution in the cement pores 

2. Fibre treatment for a chemical compatibility between cellulose based fibres and PC. 

 

However, these techniques have not totally succeeded in their purpose. The first one do not 

avoid high concentrations of Portlandite, Ca(OH)2, in liquid phase reached during the early hours of 

the hydration process (TAYLOR, 1997) and remain in large proportions (about 25%) in the matrix for 

a certain period of time depending on the consumption speed. This portlandite reduction is not an 

instantaneous process, so meanwhile fibres are subjected to highly alkaline environments. The 

second method would involve an industrial sophisticated technique that reduces the economic and 

environmental benefits of using vegetable fibres. 



20 
 

 

In this thesis, an alternative to avoid vegetable fibres degradation in FRCC is explored: the use of a 

clinker free cement, a cement based on MgO hydrated compounds, with insignificant content in Ca 

(&lt;1% by mass). With the use of cement based on magnesium oxide, to the matrix direct contact with 

Ca2+ is prevented. 

Since MgO solubility is more than 10 times lower compared to CaO, and therefore (OH)- 

content is also considerably lower, MgO-based cements are lower alkaline than PC. This new type 

of cement presents pH values below 11 over time, meanwhile Portland cement pH is above 12.5 

from the very early stages of hydration (LEA; HEWLETT, 2004). This reduced alkalinity is essential to 

yield more stable environments on pores solutions at high moisture exposure conditions. Besides, 

MgO-based cements may offer satisfactory mechanical strength compared to PC.   

According the above exposed statements, this work intends to: 

1. Obtain FRCC by using MgO-based cements as a hydraulic binder matrix and cellulose-based 

fibres as reinforcing elements  

2. Achieve optimal mechanical performance of the intended FRCC 

3. Preserve lignocellulosic reinforcement properties at long term 

Along next chapters that all together comprise this thesis, all the statements made in the 

present chapter will be further developed, detailed and properly referenced. 

 

1.2 THE USE OF CELLULOSE-BASED MATERIALS AS REINFORCING ELEMENTS IN FRCC 

1.2.1 Global warming perspective 

In spite of non-conclusive predictions on the upcoming effects of climate change, it exists a 

neat relationship between the rising temperature of both atmosphere and oceans and the increased 

concentration of greenhouse effect gases on the atmosphere. All scientific evidences point out that 

climate change will become more intense on the assumption that no reduction of greenhouse effect 

gases emissions is attained. In industrialized areas, it is especially worrying the emission of carbon 

dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere from the combustion of fossil fuels due to the greenhouse effect 

of this gas. Different alternatives to alleviate this consequence are likely. 

 



21 
 

 

1.2.2 CO2 encapsulation in cellulose as main approach 

In order to face global warming a possible solution is to intake the excess of CO2 from the 

atmosphere and store it. In nature, plants already naturally carry out this chemical process by 

photosynthesis. Thus, carbon from CO2 becomes part of the plants structure, mainly composed by 

large polymeric chains. Encapsulating plant matter is presented as a potential technique to achieve 

the atmospheric CO2 reduction. At the same time, plant fibres show excellent technical properties 

when used in composites, Table 1, that turn this material into an optimal choice to develop a low-

carbon or hypo-carbonic technology (BODROS; BALEY, 2008; BOURMAUD et al., 2013; FAKIROV; 

BHATTACHARYYA, 2007; FARUK et al., 2012; OCHI, 2008; OKSMAN; SKRIFVARS; SELIN, 2003; 

SUMMERSCALES et al., 2010). Since the renewable nature of plant fibres and the low energy 

demand to obtain them, this technology is increasingly developed by different industries. However, 

it still exists a potential room for improvement and implementing this method in building and civil 

construction.

1.2.3 Cellulose as fibre reinforcement 

Construction industry historically payed minor attention to plant fibres due to the 

biodegradable nature of these elements and, therefore, to the high maintenance cost and reduced 

durability. A prospective application to iron this disadvantage out is the embedment of plant fibres 

within construction materials. This concept emulates millennial construction techniques as adobe. 

In the case of cementitious materials, plant fibres may contribute to resist tension stresses the same 

way other reinforcing fibres do, while plant fibres are protected from environmental conditions so 

are sheltered from biological degradation.  

To understand the true potential of using use of cellulosic fibres in FRCC is necessary to 

consider the potential benefits and disadvantages associated with this application. Some 

advantages and disadvantages are highlighted below (SAVASTANO JR.; SANTOS; AGOPYAN, 2009):

J. M. (Ed.). Sustainability of construction materials. Cambridge: Woodhead Publishing, 2009. p. 55–81.  

 

This approach was initially taken by fibre-cement industry given that asbestos fibres became 

gradually banned because of their hazardousness for human health. Nevertheless, the use of plant 

fibres as reinforcing elements in cementitious composites was not successful due to the durability 

of the products. It was found to be degraded under cement alkaline environment and, consequently, 

the benefit of using plant fibres was futile. Then, fibre-cement industry moved to alternative more 

chemically compatible reinforcing polymeric fibres, as PVA initially and PP recently, though their 

higher economic, energetic and environmental cost (IKAI et al., 2010). Still, natural cellulose (type I) 

microfibrils in the crystalline regions, zoomed in Figure 1b, have outstanding elastic properties i.e.

Young’s Modulus in between 128 and 155GPa, that when it is weighted by its specific density of 

around (1.5 g·cm-3) results in a specific Young’s Modulus of around 138GPa·g-1·cm-3. 

 

1.2.4 Structure of cellulose-based fibres 

Though cellulose is the main component of plant fibres and the responsible for the 

exceptional reinforcing properties, it is important to note that cellulose is not the only constituent 

of plant fibres. Besides, each plant species shows differences in fibres microstructure with those of 

other species. It also should be noted that the microstructure of a single fibre is quite complex, and 

the fibres are composed of many cells fibre, as shown in Figure 1, where a sisal fibre section is 

schematically displayed.

In the particular case of sisal fibres, schematised in Figure 1a, its diameter is 0.3 mm and the 

cross section may be compound up to about 100 cells. The structure of a single cell presented 

schematically in Figure 1b, shows several layers of fibrils making up the fibre wall. The orientation 

of the fibrils of each layer of the wall is different. Secondary S2 wall is oriented in the macrofibre 

direction and mainly composed by large molecules of cellulose, with a degree of polymerization of 



24 
 

 

about 25,000. The chains of cellulose molecules are grouped into longitudinal microfibrils. The other 

components of the cell wall, hemicellulose and lignin, have much lower polymerization degrees and 

are mainly in the middle lamella connecting the cells of individual fibres together. Thus, sisal fibres 

are made out of approximately 54–66% cellulose, 12–17% hemicellulose, 7–14% lignin, 1% pectin 

and 1–7% ash (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013). 

In recent years, an important scientific effort has been put to understand cellulose 

degradation process and significant advances are reached (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 

2013; MOHR; NANKO; KURTIS, 2005; MOHR; BIERNACKI; KURTIS, 2006; TOLÊDO FILHO et al., 2000; 

TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; SILVA; MOBASHER; TOLEDO FILHO, 2009; WEI; MEYER, 2014). With 

current expertise, plant fibres are presented as a viable alternative to synthetic polymeric fibres for 

the fibre-cement industry and several products have been developed both in lab and industrial 

scale, proving the viability of this technology. Also further technical defies arise from this experience 

and new ways of reinforcing materials may be explored, even replacing steel reinforcing bars from 

concrete structures. In this sense, the replacement of steel materials by cellulose would involve an 

extra CO2 reduction since the high energy cost necessary to produce steel products in contrast with 

cellulose ones. 

 

1.3 PERFORMANCE OF THE FIBRES AS REINFORCEMENT FOR BENDING SOLICITATIONS 

Regarding fibres capacity to reinforce FRCC, it is assumed that in cement matrices under 

bending loads, lignocellulosic fibres induce mechanisms of fracture with a linear elastic branch 

(BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007). This is in contrast with unreinforced cement elements, which have a 

brittle behaviour. Thus, fibres addition to the matrix increases bending strength and the capacity of 

FRCC to absorb more energy before breaking by the distribution of the cracks throughout the 

material. 

Rupture or collapse in the FRCC comes from an inside defect. These deficiencies include 

broken fibres, imperfection in the cement matrix or debonding between the matrix and the fibre.  

Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of a cross section of any composite reinforced with an 

indeterminate fibre.

The illustration shows a break point before the global collapse. It is also shown that at a 

distance from the start of the crack, which propagates along the section, the fibres remain intact. In 

the fracturing process, the fibres tend to assist in the distribution of the stresses generated in the 

material by the friction generated between matrix and fibre and chemical bonding forces between 

them. If bond stresses and these hydrogen bonds do not exceed the maximum tensile stress of the 

fibre, a debonding process at the interface between fibre and matrix (points 1 and 2 in Figure 2) is 

produced. This debonding, also known as pull-out, is produced by the breaking of hydrogen bonding 

and physical type forces at the interface between fibre (point 3 in Figure 2). Pull-out means higher 

toughness performance of the material. Otherwise, when the fibre strength is lower than that of 

the chemical and physical forces generated between fibre and matrix, what occurs is breaking of 

the fibre, which leads to a decrease in toughness of the composite. 

Therefore, to avoid a brittle material behaviour it must found a compromise where the 

fibre-matrix adhesion forces are balanced with the chemical adhesion mechanisms. It is also 

important to remember that water plays an important role in the mechanisms of adhesion of the 

fibres in the matrix, since the insertion of water molecules between the hydroxyl groups at the 

interface generates weaker hydrogen bonding between fibre and matrix (TONOLI, 2010).

1.4 DURABILITY OF THE VEGETABLE FIBRES IN CEMENTITIOUS MATRICES 

Despite the potential benefits produced by the use of vegetable fibres as reinforcement in 

FRCC, these fibres present a huge inconvenience to solve their: durability. The long-term 

performance of composites reinforced with cellulose fibres can be affected by several processes, 

either separately or at the same time. 

 

1.4.1 Fibres degradation 

Traditionally two fibre degradation mechanisms have been mainly reported in FRCC 

composites: fibre mineralization due to the precipitation of calcium hydroxide in the fibre cell and 

surface (SINGH, 1985) and degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin due to the adsorption 

of calcium and hydroxyl ions (GRAM, 1983a, 1983b, 1986). Degradation of cellulose is not 

considered responsible for the major deterioration of the fibres, principally due to this process takes 

places at temperatures over 75oC and because of the large degree of polymerization of cellulose 

(&gt;25,000). Thus the studies regarding alkaline attack have been focused on hemicellulose and lignin 

degradation which are amorphous with relative low polymerization degree, so they have a higher 

hydrolysis rate and solubility in alkaline medium than cellulose (WEI; MEYER, 2014). 

Through years of research these two mechanisms have confirmed and they and their effects 

have been widely studied (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; 

WEI; MEYER, 2014). Figure 3 shows the two main mechanisms of degradation of a sisal fibre.

fiber cement composite systems. Cement and Concrete Composites, Kidlington, v. 40, p. 30–39, July. 2013. 

 

As lignin and hemicellulose are responsible for linking the microfibril structure, their 

degradation may also lead to a reduction in the macro mechanical properties of the fibres as a result 

of breaking the link between individual fibre cells (GRAM, 1983a; MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO 

FILHO, 2013; WEI; MEYER, 2014). This process is schematically explained in Figure 4.

p.458. 

Vegetable fibres can suffer various degrees of degradation when exposed to an alkaline 

environment. The extent of the attack, as determined by strength loss of the fibres, depends on the 



28 
 

 

kind of alkaline solution (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009). The embrittlement of the composites may be 

mainly associated with the mineralisation of the fibres due to the migration of hydration products, 

especially calcium hydroxide, to the fibre lumen, walls and voids (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). This 

may also reduce the amount of cellulose (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013).  

Despite of all researches agree that mineralisation brittles the fibres so toughness may be 

severely decreased, there is no wide assent about the effects on fibres tensile strength. Some 

authors (AKERS; STUDINKA, 1989) suggest that the fibre flexural strength increases with 

prettification, while some others propose the opposite (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; MELO FILHO; 

SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013). Nevertheless, even considering positive effects on fibre tensile 

strength, fibre mineralization is an undesired phenomenon since it also reduces the pull-out 

mechanism in FRCC. 

Another factor to be considered is that fibres degradation is more obvious when they are 

attacked by Ca(OH)2 than with other alkaline hydroxide solutions. This aspect may be associated 

with the calcium hydroxide deposited in the lumen and voids of the fibre cells (GRAM, 1983a; SINGH, 

1985; TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). According to this, apart from alkaline attack it is important the 

composition of alkaline minerals that contribute differently to the mineralization process of the 

fibres. 

According to different studies where FRCC is assessed by accelerated ageing tests, the 

degradation process occurs rapidly, from the early stages (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; 

WEI; MEYER, 2014) and after longer ages a quite expressive modification in the flexural behaviour 

is observed. In these works, the residual mechanical parameters after accelerated ageing are the 

same as those observed in the unreinforced matrix. It was proposed that the initial calcium 

hydroxide content in the composite plays a significant role on the degradation along with wetting 

and drying cycles. Improvements in the composite durability are likely related to a reduction in the 

calcium hydroxide content and the stabilization of the alkali content. For the composites with 

reduced content in Ca(OH)2, fibre mineralization was satisfactorily prevented (MELO FILHO; SILVA; 

TOLEDO FILHO, 2013). Accelerated ageing treatments speed up the effect of both alkali hydrolysis 

of fibre’s amorphous components and mineralization of fibre cell wall. This was confirmed by the 

highest crystallinity indices and minimum content of cellulose (WEI; MEYER, 2014). 



29 
 

 

1.4.2 Fibre-matrix interface modification 

This process of degradation is important because strength and ductility performance is 

primarily governed by the fibre–matrix interface (BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007), or also called Interface 

Transition Zone (ITZ) , which allows fibre bridging and bonding mechanism which results in the 

distribution of micro-crack pattern (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013). Reductions in the 

frictional stress may be produced because of an interface fatigue mechanism. This is due to the 

volumetric variation of the sisal fibres after wetting and drying stress (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO 

FILHO, 2013). Since the reductions in the frictional stress, reduction in strength and toughness is 

produced from the early ages of the composites.  

Several studies, with help of Scanning Electrons Microscopy (SEM), have reported 

modifications in the ITZ over time. In these studies was found that the gap between the binding 

zone surrounding the fibre surface and the fibre perimeter is larger in an unaged specimens than in 

the specimen submitted to ageing (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). 

There are mechanical properties specifically related to these modifications in the ITZ. 

Certain works associate a weak matrix in the vicinity of the fibre, and therefore its easiness for 

cracking, to the increase of the FRCC ductility (SAVASTANO JR; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2005). These 

authors points to the densening of matrix areas around the fibres or fibre embrittlement due to 

migration of hydration products from the matrix to the fibres as the main that increases flexural 

strength until first crack appears. This increase for the first crack to appear yields reduction in 

toughness, by reducing the flexibility and deformation capacity of the fibres (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 

2000).  

However, other authors consider denser matrices surrounding the fibres as more favouring 

conditions for pull-out processes to occur. In this sense, a denser ITZ is likely to improve the contact 

between fibres and cement matrix, and certainly favouring the better adhesion between them. 

Thus, higher energy is absorbed by the composite due to the frictional slipping process during the 

pulling-out of fibres with a better interface with the matrix (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., 

2014).

1.5 SOLUTIONS AGAINST THE DEGRADATION OF CELLULOSE-BASED FIBRES 

1.5.1 Low Ca(OH)2 cementitious matrices 

As previously mentioned, the lignin-cellulosic fibres used as reinforcements in FRCC exhibit 

serious problems of durability due to a number of factors, most notably the fibre degradation in 

highly alkaline environments. The majority of studies in this area agree that this loss of mechanical 

properties of the vegetable fibres over time in PC matrices is caused by the dissolution and 

decomposition of hemicellulose and lignin of the middle layer. Thus, the link between the individual 

fibres is broken. This breakdown is produced by the attack of OH- ions from the Ca(OH)2 on lignin 

and hemicelluoses. In turn, another detrimental effect on the mechanical performance of the fibres 

is the crystallization thereof and embrittlement of the ITZ. This phenomenon occurs when the cell 

lumen is filled with cations Ca2+ and fibre surrounding presents a high Ca(OH)2 concentration 

exceeding from calcium silicates hydration. 

It seems logical, therefore, eliminate, or at least reduce the amount of Ca(OH)2 in the 

matrices to improve the durability of the fibres. Many authors have already achieved successful 

experiences by this approach. 

 

1.5.2 Use of pozzolan additions 

Within the traditional cement manufacturing process, considering the energy required for 

cement production processes and the stoichiometry of limestone and clay calcination (which also 

implies CO2 emissions), a straight route to reduce CO2 emissions has been the reduction of clinker 

to obtain cementitious materials. This reduction of clinker is likely through the replacement of 

Portland cement by other binding products. This proposed solution, the reduction of calcium 

hydroxide within the cementitious matrix, becomes a real solution with the partial replacement of 

cement by pozzolanic materials (JOHN et al., 2005; MOHR; BIERNACKI; KURTIS, 2007; SAVASTANO 

JR.; SANTOS; AGOPYAN, 2009; SANTOS et al., 2012).  

When referring to the pozzolanic materials is referred to all, both natural and artificial, 

materials capable of combining directly with lime, at room temperature and in the presence of 

water, to form inorganic cementitious materials compounds similar to those major constituents 



31 
 

 

originated in the hydration of Portland cement. Also pozzolans are defined as follows (EN 

494:2012+A1:2015, 2012): 

Siliceous or siliceous and aluminous material which, in itself, possesses little or no 

cementitious value but which will, in finely divided form and in the presence of water, react 

chemically with calcium hydroxide at ordinary temperature to form compounds possessing 

cementitious properties. 

In this regard, it should be noted that Ca(OH)2, (CH), present in cement matrices is derived 

from the hydration reactions of bicalcium silicate (C2S) and tricalcium (C3S) to form calcium silicate 

hydrate gel (C3S2H3) commonly mentioned as S-C-H phase. It is in this hydration reaction where the 

calcium hydroxide or portlandite is released according to the following equations: 

2C2S +4H ? C3S2H3 +  CH (1) 

2C3S +6H ? C3S2H3 +  3CH (2) 

 

Thus, pozzolans therefore react with the calcium hydroxide released by the hydration of 

Portland cement to give other products of desirable mechanical properties as hydrated gels (silicates 

(SCH), aluminates (ACH) and calcium silico-aluminates hydrated (ASCH), as shown below (Figure 5): 

S +  CH +  H ? SCH (3) 

  A+  CH +  H ? ACH (4) 

SA +  CH +  H ? ASCH (5) 

 

Therefore, the use of pozzolanic materials, in addition to meeting the goal of eliminating 

Portlandite content, help to improve the mechanical strength of the cementitious matrix.

Considering the previous premises, 1) incorporation of plant fibre to resist tension stresses and 

2) removal of Ca(OH)2 from the final hydrated binding composition, the partial replacement of PC 

by pozzolanic materials has been explored. 

 

1.5.3 Use of carbonation techniques  

In order to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, a similar strategy is the 

encapsulation of carbon within cementitious matrices. This procedure has been traditionally 

avoided in order to prevent steel reinforcement corrosion in building constructions. One the main 

features of hardened Portland cement is its high alkalinity, which allows the passivation of the steel 

bars that reinforce concrete elements (TAYLOR, 1997). This elevated alkalinity is given by Ca(OH)2 

from the cement hydration process, which is very soluble, releasing Ca2+ and (OH)- ions to the 

cement pores suspensions. While Ca(OH)2 is desirable in terms of steel protection, this hydrated 

constituent is considered to provide reduced mechanical performance, being considered the 

weakest component of aged cement. Therefore, in cementitious materials where steel 

reinforcement is not required, Ca(OH)2 would not be of any importance, being its replacement by 

other stronger components a beneficial technique.  



33 
 

 

A possibility for both carbon encapsulation and Ca(OH)2 reduction in PC is possible through 

carbonation. Carbonation is a physicochemical process that takes place within the pores of 

hardened Portland cement. In the aqueous solution within PC matrices, Ca(OH)2 is constantly solved 

and precipitated according to (6). High alkalinity, and therefore high (OH)- concentrations, in 

aqueous solutions promotes the easy formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) so CO2 gets dissolved,  as 

shown in (7). Thus, alkalinity is reduced which favours the precipitation of calcite, (CaCO3), following 

(8). 

Ca(OH)2 ? Ca
2+ +2(OH)? (6) 

 CO2 +H2O ? H2CO3 ? 2H
+ +CO3

2? (7) 

Ca2+ +2(OH)? +2H+ +CO3
2? ? CaCO3 +H2O (8) 

 

Carbonation in PC based materials naturally occurs at environmental conditions over time. 

This process is more important on the edges of the settled PC based elements, losing its effectivity 

to the inwards of the elements. CO2 gets through the matrix pores and starts the carbonation 

process. This way, carbonation of cement elements has been proved to meet this principle, both 

removing Ca(OH)2  by its reaction with CO2 and producing calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a denser 

component, more rigid and stronger (FRÍAS; GOÑI, 2013; MORANDEAU; THIÉRY; DANGLA, 2015; 

MO; ZHANG; DENG, 2015; ZHA et al., 2015). Though densification of cement yields better 

mechanical attributes to the hydrated cement, it also hinders environmental CO2 to the core of the 

PC based elements. This problem has already sorted out by the modification of the environment 

conditions (CO2 concentration increase, optimal humidity and temperature) to boost carbonation 

reactions in the early stages of PC within the whole matrix. 

Besides, in conjunction with the first strategy to encapsulate CO2 using  plant fibres as 

reinforcing material, carbonation becomes a favourable option since the removal of Ca(OH)2 from 

cement matrices has been evidenced efficient to increase cellulose durability and encapsulate CO2. 

When fibre-cement products are exposed to elevated CO2 concentration at early ages, moreover, 

technical features are improved, obtaining outstanding products along with the encapsulation of 

CO2 from the environment (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., 2014; PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; 

PURNELL et al., 2003; SANTOS et al., 2015a). 

 



34 
 

 

1.5.4 Fibre treatments  

Another methodology to achieve a better long-term performance of the FRCC is the partial 

modification of the fibres’ properties. Since fibre degradation is produced via contact with some 

compounds from PC hydration, it is also possible to avoid a direct interface between alkaline 

environments and potential degradable components of plant fibres (hemicellulose and lignin 

mainly) by modifying the surface of the fibres. This is feasible using different techniques such as 

grafting with different agents (BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2005; TONOLI et al., 2009b, 2013) and 

methane plasma treatment (BARRA et al., 2012), amongst others. The positive effects of these type 

of treatments on the durability of the fibres over time along with the possibility of combining any 

fibre treatment with less alkaline matrix boost this methodology.  

Besides, other crude methods, like bleaching and hornification (TONOLI et al., 2012; 

BALLESTEROS et al., 2015), have been satisfactorily explored. Although these techniques are not 

entirely effective to avoid fibre degradation, it is possible to use them together with lower alkaline 

matrices. Thus, the effects of these methods are more effective with no interference.  

 

1.5.5 Limitations of the proposed solutions 

Despite the apparent benefits of the use of pozzolanic materials or carbonation techniques 

to improve the durability of vegetable fibres within a cement matrix, its application has limitations. 

The main obstacle is the chemical activity, pozzolanic activity or carbonation activity, which is based 

in the reaction with Ca2+ from Ca(OH)2. Pozzolanic reaction and carbonation are not instantaneous 

processes, so while the pozzolan and CO2 reacts with portlandite, fibres undergo highly alkaline 

environments. Considering that Ca(OH)2 in dissolved in an aqueous solution, releasing Ca2+ cations, 

and given the hygroscopic nature of lignocellulosic fibres, Ca absorption by plant tissues is likely as 

well as an alkalinity increase in the cell walls. Although higher concentrations of Portlandite in liquid 

phase (about 25%) are reached during the early hours of the hydration process (TAYLOR, 1997), 

portlandite remains in large proportions in the matrix for a certain period of time depending on the 

rapidity of  pozzolanic and carbonation reactions.  



35 
 

 

Regarding fibre treatments, this alternative would reduce the economic and environmental 

advantage of using cellulose-based fibres as reinforcement in FRCC. In this sense, cellulose-based 

materials bring limited improvement compared to PVA and PP fibres. 

 

1.6 LOW-ALKALINITY MATRIX COMPOSITES BASED ON MAGNESIUM OXIDE CEMENT 

In order to avoid direct contact between fibres and the high alkalinity water occluded within 

the matrix, this work explores the replacement of PC by a fast setting and lower alkalinity alternative 

binder:  magnesium (Mg) based cement. The main advantage of using this type of cement is that 

the amount of Ca compounds is insignificant in its composition. Therefore, the reduction of Ca(OH)2 

in the hardened binder is utterly solved. 

 

1.6.1  Mg in low-alkalinity hydraulic binders 

MgO based cement, also known as reactive magnesia cements, may be described as 

cementitious materials in which composition MgO is used.  

Mg is the eighth most abundant element in the solar system and constitutes about 2% of 

Earth crust. It is also the third most abundant element in solution in seawater, with a concentration 

of about 1300 ppm. However, MgO, or also known as magnesia or periclase, is not obtained by 

direct mining due to its scarcity on Earth crust. The most important rock-forming minerals containing 

magnesium are chlorites, pyroxene and amphibole group minerals, dolomites, and magnesium 

calcites (calcite with some of the Ca replaced by Mg). Mg is also present in magnesite (MgCO3), 

nesquehonite (MgCO3.3H2O), lansfordite (MgCO3.5H2O) and brucite [Mg(OH)2]. In addition, there is 

a series of basic hydrated magnesium carbonates having the empirical formula 

xMgCO3.yMg(OH)2.zH2O. These include hydromagnesite 4MgCO3.Mg(OH)2.4H2O and artinite 

MgCO3.Mg(OH)2.3H2O. Magnesium also occurs in salt deposits such as carnallite (KMgCl3.6H2O), 

epsomite (MgSO4.7H2O) and kieserite (MgSO4.H2O).  

It has been estimated that the total mass of the sedimentary layer in Earth’s crust is 1.4x1018 

tonnes (WEDEPHOL, 1969). Carbonate rocks constitute about 8wt% of the total sediments 

(GOLDSCHMIDT, 1954). Magnesite (MgCO3) is the magnesium end member of an isomorphous 



36 
 

 

series of carbonates. Hereafter, this study focuses on the use of MgO from MgCO3 thermal 

decomposition, as follows: 

MgCO3
&gt;600oC
?      MgO+CO2 

(9) 

 

1.6.2   Mg carbonate cements 

MgCO3 calcination according to (9) is reversible and it is possible to obtain a hydraulic binder 

through this opposite reaction called carbonation. Carbonation is also possible in an aqueous 

environment, which previously hydrates MgO to form Mg(OH)2 and at last forms a Hydrated 

Magnesium Carbonate (HMC), with the generic form of xMgCO3.yMg(OH)2.zH2O.  

MgO+H2O ? ?·Mg(OH)2 +?·CO2 ? xMgCO3.yMg(OH)2.zH2O (10) 

 

These HMC are the main binder component of this type of cement (LISKA; AL-TABBAA, 

2009). This attempt of introducing Mg as a binding system was initially explored to reduce PC 

content in cementitious systems. However, this application is out of the purpose pursued by using 

MgO for composites reinforced with lignocellulosic fibres. Based on the results obtained from this 

experience, this HMC system is effective when the cement to aggregates ratio is too low (0.1), in 

which case compressive strength is even higher than PC. Nevertheless, since this system is based on 

carbonation, similar handicaps found in PC carbonation may arise for this innovative system, where 

higher cement to aggregates ratios result into less porous matrices that difficult carbonation 

process. 

 

1.6.3 Magnesium oxide (MgO) based cements 

The origin of magnesia cement, in 1867, was magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC), 

obtained from the reaction between MgO and an aqueous magnesium chloride (MgCl2) solution. 

The main bonding phases found in this hardened system are Mg(OH)2, 5Mg(OH)2.MgCl2.8H2O (5-

form) and 3Mg(OH)2.MgCl2.8H2O (3-form) (SHAND, 2006). This material is widely known as Sorel 

cement, but it is not the only type of magnesia cement. Magnesium oxychloride cement has not 

remained popular in the building industry is that the magnesium oxychloride phase is not stable in 



37 
 

 

prolonged contact with water, which will result in the leaching of magnesium chloride from the 

cement phase, leaving Mg(OH)2 behind as the binder. Since Mg(OH)2 does not have adequate 

strength, the cement bond as a whole is severely weakened. 

In the literature it is been reported two other well-known magnesia cements. The first is 

magnesium oxysulfate (MOS), which is the sulphate analogous of magnesium oxychloride and is 

formed by the reaction between Mg and magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) in an aqueous solution. Four 

oxysulfate phases are formed at temperatures between 30 and 120oC: Mg(OH)2.MgSO4.3H2O (5-

form), 3Mg(OH)2.MgSO4.8H2O (3-form), Mg(OH)2.MgSO4.5H2O, and Mg(OH)2.2MgSO4.3H2O. Only 

the 3-form and 5-form are stable at 25oC (SHAND, 2006). This cement has the same lack of water 

resistance as MOC cement. 

The second is magnesium phosphate cement (MAP), formed by the reaction between MgO 

and a soluble phosphate, such as dibasic ammonium phosphate (NH4H2PO4). The main phases 

reported in this cement are struvite (NH4MgPO4·6H2O), newberyite (MgHPO4·3H2O), hannayite 

[(NH4)2Mg3H4(PO4)4·8H2O], schertelite [(NH4)2MgH2(PO4)2·4H2O], dittmarite (NH4MgPO4·H2O), 

stercorite (NaNH4HPO4·4H2O) and struvite-K (MgKPO4·6H2O) (WALLING; PROVIS, 2016). Similarly to 

what happens to MOC and MOS, the reaction between MgO and phosphoric acid results in a water-

soluble cementitious mass, this type of cement has no practical use after ageing. 

 

1.6.4 Magnesium oxide (MgO) and silica (SiO2) based cements 

A different solution becomes possible where Ca chemistry is replaced by Mg, and the 

cement is produced by combining reactive MgO and highly amorphous SiO2 to form magnesium 

silicate hydrate (M-S-H in cement chemistry nomenclature, M: MgO; S: SiO2; H: H2O) (SZCZERBA et 

al., 2013; JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014; WALLING 

et al., 2015). Whereas this type of cement historically attracted limited interest, during the last 

decade it has attracted research interest. In initial studies of this system, a great amount of bonding 

M-S-H was achieved with satisfactory mechanical properties (JIANGXIONG; YIMIN; YONGXIN, 2006).  

Apart from the potentially suitable mechanical performance of this material, the present 

thesis is mainly interested in a different characteristic, its lower alkalinity (pH&lt;11) (ZHANG; 

CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011). In accordance with different studies, after evaluating MgO-



38 
 

 

based cements alkalinity, pH values are below 11 before 7 days and around 10 after 14 days. 

According to the wide collection of studies about fibres degradation processes and the mechanisms 

that lead to the loss of mechanical properties of the fibres as cement reinforcement, using MgO-

based cements provides potential and less aggressive environments than PC, where pH is above 

12.5 from the very early stages of hydration. 

Another aspect to be considered to protect fibres against environmental humidity variations 

is the use of lowest permeability matrices. This aim could be achieved by using lower porosity 

matrices, restricting humidity variations from the outside environment. In this case MgO-based 

cement seems to have a higher apparent density (KRYSZTAFKIEWICZ et al., 2004). 

 

1.7 CLARIFYING REMARKS ABOUT THIS WORK 

A MgO and SiO2 hydraulic binding system is applied in this work in order to assess its real 

potential to obtain long term durable FRCC completely reinforced with lignocellulosic elements. 

According to the previous reasons above offered, cellulose-based reinforcing elements in FRCC 

become a promising option to develop a beneficial technology from an economic, environmental 

and social point of view. Nonetheless, some clarifying remarks are presented for a better 

understand the initial intention, possible limitations and solutions for future studies. 

 

1.7.1 Use of reactive MgO from MgCO3 thermal decomposition 

The first point addressed is the calcination process of MgCO3. MgO used for this work is 

provided by Magnesita SA, South America’s leading producer of dead-burn and caustic-calcined 

magnesia as well as refractory products. Production of magnesite is almost entirely centred on the 

deposits around Brumado, located in Brazilian south-western Bahia State. Magnesita has the 

capacity to produce around 2.7 Mt of unburnt magnesite a year as well as 272,000 tonnes/year of 

dead-burned magnesite, although current production levels are about 231,000 tonnes per annum. 

Caustic calcined magnesite output is around 41,000 tonnes per year. The major commercial deposit 

of crystalline magnesite is in the area of Serra das Éguas, where the magnesite occurs as bladelike 

aggregates and euhedral crystals. Magnesite also occurs as massive aggregates, which comprises 

the commercial ore. This ore ranges in colour from white to a red-orange owing to the presence of 



39 
 

 

a finely divided hematite. The most typical is fine- to medium-grained white or light gray magnesite. 

The formation of this deposit is thought to have involved magnesium-bearing solutions depositing 

magnesite as a replacement of dolomite and altering quartz to enstatite and talc (SHAND, 2006). 

The essential reaction that occurs during MgCO3 heating is the loss of carbon dioxide from 

magnesite, with the corresponding formation of magnesium oxide; see (9). The full decomposition 

of 1.0 kg of pure magnesite yields 0.48 kg magnesium oxide and 0.52 kg of carbon dioxide. 

Therefore, it will require 2.08 kg of pure magnesite to yield 1.0 kg of magnesium oxide. 

According to SimaPro 8 database, used to calculate impact assessment results: 

? Total mining and transport of raw materials related CO2 emissions = 0.01-0.015 t CO2/t MgO 

? Total electricity or fuel related CO2 emissions = 0.13-0.15 t CO2/t MgO 

 Also from stoichiometry, the CO2 released during calcination process of magnesite to 

magnesium oxide is approximately 1.09 t CO2/t MgO. 

Altogether, a total value of approximately 1.23-1.26 t CO2/t MgO are released to the 

atmosphere. 

Comparing CO2 emission values to those for Portland cement (0.9-1t CO2/t MgO) (GARTNER, 

2004; BARCELO et al., 2014), MgO production may be considered as more pollutant option. 

Nevertheless, the proposed binder system is a blend of MgO and SiO2 based materials that could 

result in much reduced emission per tonne of binder. According to literature, up to 50% of the 

binding system may be constituted by SiO2 additions, which could clearly decrease these CO2 

emission figures.  

 

1.7.2 Lower carbon alternatives for obtaining reactive MgO 

Another route to obtain reactive MgO was proposed two decades ago (LACKNER et al., 

1995). It was suggested a new production technology to obtain MgO from magnesium silicates, MS, 

(Figure 7). In accordance with this process magnesium silicates decomposition does not involve any 

CO2 chemical emission and only fuel related emission occurs. Thus, only 0.2-0.4 tonnes of CO2 are 

emitted for each tonne of MgO produced, reducing considerably the pollutant effect of MgCO3 

calcination.

1153–1170, 1995. 

 

The production of reactive MgO from MS was also explored by Novacem Ltd. This former 

Imperial College London spin-out developed several products regarding Mg-based technology. 

Although the company liquidation in 2012, Novacem left an intellectual property legacy, currently 

in possession of Calix (Australia), that included an improved process for manufacturing MgCO3 from 

MS ores by carbonation (i .e. treatment with carbon dioxide and/or carbonic acid H2CO3 at high 

temperature and pressure) (VLASOPOULOS; BERNEBEU, 2014). Very interesting advantages from 

this system are obtained since CO2 is cyclically recovered into the process for raw materials 

carbonation; see Figure 7. Another positive aspect derived from this process is the low temperature 

demand that makes viable the use of fuels with low energy content. Novacem claimed to produce 

carbon negative cement, though it was never industrially upscaled for cement products 

manufacture. Despite the initial shortcomings of Novacem technology (high pressure demand and 

high degree of milling to process raw materials), this approach has been pointed out as energy-

competitive with PC (GARTNER; HIRAO, 2015), though more research was essential to develop viable 

Mg-based cement.

1.7.3 Use of reactive SiO2 

In this work, reactive SiO2 is obtained from silica fume (SF). This SF is U920, provided by 

Elkem Materials South America Ltda, Diadema, SP, Brazil. SF is widely reported to be very effective 

pozzolan material (ZELI? et al., 2000; ROY; ARJUNAN; SILSBEE, 2001; WONG; ABDUL RAZAK, 2005). 

SF, also called microsilica, (CAS number 69012-64-2, EINECS number 273-761-1) is an amorphous 

(non-crystalline) polymorph of SiO2. This spherical shaped mineral, with an average diameter of 

0.15?m, is obtained as a by-product of the silicon and ferrosilicon alloy production. After years of 

experience, SF is not considered as a waste product any longer and it is widely employed as an 

essential compound to produced high strength cements. With time, SF pirce has arisen and it is not 

an economic option to produce FRCC. However, SF is chosen since its pozzolanic nature is broadly 

understood as well as its homogeneity facilitates a better reproducibility of laboratory scale tests. 

One more interesting aspect to be considered from Novacem technique (Figure 7) is the 

production of SiO2 as a by-product from the carbonation process of MS, according to (11). This SiO2, 

when amorphous and finely obtained is the second mineral necessary to produce the previously 



42 
 

 

mentioned cement based on MgO-SiO2. Therefore, MgO-SiO2 cement has a promising route to go 

follow the initial steps made by this company.

1.7.4 Dewatering-pressing moulding technique (DPM) 

In front of all the possibilities given by the use of MgO-SiO2 and cellulose-based fibres, this 

thesis focuses on the production of FRCC moulded following a dewatering-pressing moulding, DPM, 

technique.  

Based on the scientific career of the supervisor of this thesis 

(lattes.cnpq.br/4108663280979993) and his renowned success in introducing cellulose-based 

elements in FRCC by DPM, this method becomes as the most suitable solution to produce the 

specimens tested during this work. For a clear assessment of the durability of these composites, the 

produced FRCC uses only lignocellulosic reinforcement from paper pulping. 

This moulding process is an adaptation of the Hatschek process to a laboratory scale, 

displayed in Figure 8. The Hatschek process involves the production of fibre cement by overlaying 

thin sheets made of a mixture of cementitious binders, fibres, aggregates and water. Thin sheets of 

fibre cement are obtained by retention of solid materials during filtration in rotary sieves, which are 

later transferred and accumulated in a cylindrical press, to obtain the desired thickness. The 

cellulose fibres have an essential role in this process, since they constitute the network of fibres that 

trap suspended solids during filtration. The adaptation of the Hatschek process to a DPM has been 

successfully reproduced and described (DIAS; SAVASTANO JR.; JOHN, 2010). With this adaptation, 

DPM allows to obtain very thin materials that simplicities the flexural performance analysis of the 

composites since insignificant compressive contribution of the cement is produced under bending 

tests.

Considering the hydration reaction of MgO to form Mg(OH)2 (12), to hydrate 1g of MgO it is 

needed approximately 0.4467g of H2O. However, due to the high specific surface area of reactive 

MgO, more water is required to promote a dissolving-precipitating process until total MgO is 

hydrated, as well as extra water is required for a minimum flowability in order to assure a good 

casting. At this point DPM also results favourable since this process introduces an initial extra 

amount of water for the composite casting and later removes it. In the case of Mg-based materials 

this is of importance since no additive is required for moulding.

1.8 STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS 

The present work is composed of 5 different experimental studies as displayed in Figure 9. 

Each experimental work is considered as an independent block.  

The whole study has been structured in three main experimental stages, as depicted in 

Figure 9: 



44 
 

 

1) Optimization of the MgO-SiO? binding system for FRCC production with cellulosic reinforcing 

elements  (Block 1) 

2) Durability studies (Block 2 and Block 5). Analysis of the different aspects of the cellulose based 

reinforcing elements durability. While Block 2 assesses the durability of lignocellulosic elements 

introduced as pulp to reinforce thin plates, along with the analysis of the composites mechanical 

performance before and after ageing, Block 5 only focuses on the durability of macrofibres in terms 

of chemical integrity before and after time when are embedded in cement matrices.  

3) FRCC optimization studies (Block 3 and Block 4). Introduction of two different routes to improve 

MgO-SiO2 systems: the use of different curing treatments to promote carbonation of Mg hydrates 

compounds (Block 3) and the incorporation of magnesium silicate hydrates additives to improve 

composite performance (Block 4). 

Part of Block 4 and Block 5 were developed in Spain, at the Department of Chemestry 

Engineering of Universidad Complutense de Madrid and at the Institute of Materials Technology of 

Universitat Politècnica de València respectively.

1.9 AIM OF THE DIFFERENT BLOCKS 

1.9.1 BLOCK 1  

Optimization of the MgO-SiO? binding system for FRCC production with cellulosic reinforcing 

elements 

This block has been adapted from: (MÁRMOL et al., 2016). Every Table and Figure has 

been adapted from this only source. 

A range of MgO and SiO2 blends mixed with water is analysed to develop clinker-free Fibre 

Reinforced Cementitious Composites (FRCC) products reinforced with cellulosic fibres. For FRCC 

production, particularly in the case of fibre-cement products, it is necessary to understand the early 

properties of the binding matrix, since rapid development of rigidity (in the first week of age) is 

required during the production and stock process. For this reason, this chapter assesses the 

hydration evolution from 7 to 28 days of different MgO-SiO2 formulations simulating the fibre-



46 
 

 

cement manufacture conditions. Hence, the optimal dosage by a compromise solution between the 

lowest alkalinity (from mixing until 28 days) and the highest mechanical performance (at 7 and 28 

days) is chosen. 

1.9.2 BLOCK 2 

Study of the degradation of FRCC with MgO-SiO? cement matrix reinforced with cellulosic 

reinforcing elements 

This block has been adapted from: (MÁRMOL; SAVASTANO, 2017). Every Table and Figure 

has been adapted from this only source. 

This block assesses the use of low alkaline composites based on magnesium oxide and silica 

(MgO-SiO2) cement and reinforced with cellulose fibres for the production of thin FRCC to resist 

bending loads. The strategy adopted aims to study the durability of lignocellulosic fibres in a lower 

pH environment than the ordinary Portland cement (PC) by comparing the flexural performance of 

samples at 28 days and after 200 accelerated ageing cycles (aac). Furthermore, apparent porosity 

(AP), bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) are assessed both at 28 days and after 200 aac. 

Two types of vegetable fibres are utilised: eucalyptus and pine pulps. 

1.9.3 BLOCK 3 

Effect of carbonation curing on FRCC based on MgO-SiO? systems 

High CO2 concentration environment is evaluated as a curing treatment in order to optimise 

Mg-based cementitious matrices in FRCC. Thin FRCC made out of MgO-SiO2 binding systems and 

reinforced with polypropylene (PP) and cellulosic (pine) pulp, are produced by a Dewatering 

Pressing Moulding (DPM) technique are mechanically and physically characterized. Samples are 

cured under two different conditions: 1) steam water curing at 55oC and 2) a complementary high 

CO2 concentration (20% by volume). To evaluate the mechanical performance of the MgO-SiO2 

cement and the possibility to be fibre reinforced, 4 point-bending test is used. In addition, apparent 

porosity (AP), bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) are assessed. In order to study the 

effects of carbonation on the materials, and their performance over time, cycles of accelerated 

ageing are used. At this point, PP fibres are introduced along with lignocellulosic fibres in this thesis 

since they are longer fibres, and therefore yield better energy dispersion by pull-out. Higher energy 



47 
 

 

dispersion samples facilitate the evaluation of the CO2 curing treatment and its effects on FRCC. Also 

the thermodynamic stability of the possible obtained HMC on the matrix is confirmed. 

1.9.4 BLOCK 4 

Effect of sepiolite addition on FRCC based on MgO-SiO? systems 

The addition of sepiolite in FRCC is analysed as a possible additive constituent of the binding 

matrix. With the intention of optimising the Mg-SiO2 cementitious system in FRCC, small cement 

replacement (1 and 2% wt.) by sepiolite is introduced in the composites so its effects are studied, 

firstly, in hardened cement pastes and, later, in FRCC systems. When used only in cement pastes, 

non-destructive studies are used to assess flexural performance over time as well as the possible 

reactivity between additive and cement. When sepiolite is introduced in FRCC, the properties of the 

slurry suspensions are evaluated to understand its interference in the Dewatering Pressing 

Moulding (DPM) process and, finally, flexural tests are carried out to understand the outcome of 

this additive on the mechanical performance of the composite. 

1.9.5 BLOCK 5 

Study of the degradation of sisal fibres in MgO-SiO? cement matrices compared to degradation 

in PC matrices 

After proving that cellulose microfibres do not suffer any chemical degradation, when used 

in thin FRCC made out of MgO-SiO2 cement, it becomes essential to understand the behaviour of 

macrofibres when submitted to the same conditions. Although this thesis only focuses on the 

performance of the FRCC produced by DPM, it becomes necessary to evaluate the real potential of 

all types of cellulosic fibres in order to obtain different types of FRCC, especially those reinforced 

with longer fibres. In this sense, the comparative study of fibre degradation when applied in 

different cementitious systems, MgO-SiO2 and PC, reveals the real compatibility of lignocellulosic 

fibres and Mg-based cement. Since several authors have broadly used sisal to reinforce PC 

composites and its deterioration has been well reported, this type of fibre has been selected to 

assess its integrity over time in MgO-SiO2 systems.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW 

The use of lignocellulosic fibres in FRCC  was proposed ever since the production of 

asbestos-free fibre-cement became a key challenge from a technical point of view (COUTTS, 2005). 

At present, necessity for new fibre cement technologies is increasing to attend the huge demand 

that exists in both developing countries and more industrialized areas. It has increasingly become a 

very interesting material as reinforcement element for FRCCs, e.g. flat sheets, roofing and siding 

shingles, and clapboards, due to their excellent mechanical properties (ARDANUY; CLARAMUNT; 

TOLEDO FILHO, 2015). Many other types of fibres present a remarkable potential as reinforcement 

elements in cementitious products i.e. carbon (BAEZA et al., 2013; SHU et al., 2015), synthetic 

polymers (HAN et al., 2012), rubber (GUPTA; CHAUDHARY; SHARMA, 2016), glass fibre reinforced 

plastic (ASOKAN; OSMANI; PRICE, 2009) or steel (MADANDOUST et al., 2015; SENARATNE et al., 

2016). In spite of their suitable properties, these synthetic fibres introduce an extra cost in the 

production of FRCC and likewise are not the best option from an environmental point of view 

(TONOLI et al., 2010).  On the other hand , lignocellulosic fibres, when used with Portland cement, 

undergo alkaline degradation leading to deterioration in flexural properties over time. Vegetable 

fibres can suffer various degrees of degradation when exposed to an alkaline environment and this 

degradation is especially manifested when fibres are exposed to alkaline environments which are 

also rich in Ca2+ (TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000).  

The degradation of lignocellulosic fibres is thoroughly described (MELO FILHO; SILVA; 

TOLEDO FILHO, 2013), though the mechanism of degradation becomes difficult to establish since it 

includes three combined factors on the deterioration of sisal fibre (WEI; MEYER, 2014):  

(i) Alkaline pore water, from cement hydration, dissolves the amorphous materials of 

fibre, such as waxes, fats, hemicelluloses and lignin, which are susceptible to both 

Ca(OH)2 and high alkalinity attack and can be disintegrated in alkali environment. This 

declines the linkage between individual fibre cells, leading to the decrease of tensile 

strength;  

(ii) alkaline hydrolysis of cellulose molecules, which generates a rupture between 

molecular chains and so a reduction in degree of polymerization and lower tensile 

strength, since the strength of fibre mainly depends on the content of crystalline 

cellulose; and  



49 
 

 

(iii) crystallization of lime in the lumen, walls of the individual fibres and middle lamellae 

yielding a reduction in the fibre flexibility and strength, which is also known as fibre 

mineralization process.  

 

Many attempts to solve this inconvenience have been explored effectively, improving fibre 

integrity after ageing, although far from achieving a completely successful solution. So far, all the 

techniques used to improve vegetable fibre durability in Portland cement are based on the 

reduction of portlandite, by the use of highly reactive pozzolans (BEZERRA et al., 2006; MÁRMOL et 

al., 2013; PEREIRA et al., 2013) and carbonation (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., 2014; SANTOS 

et al., 2015a). However, these methods rely on chemical reactions which take place gradually rather 

than immediately, and this means that the vegetable fibres are surrounded by high concentrations 

of Ca(OH)2 in the initial stages, which may be deleterious for reinforcing performance (TOLEDO 

FILHO et al., 2000). 

A different solution becomes possible where Ca chemistry is replaced by Mg, and the 

cement is produced by combining reactive MgO and highly amorphous SiO2 to form magnesium 

silicate hydrate (M-S-H in cement chemistry nomenclature, M: MgO; S: SiO2; H: H2O) (SANDBERG; 

MOSBERG, 1989). In initial studies of this system, a great amount of bonding M-S-H is achieved with 

satisfactory mechanical properties (SANDBERG; MOSBERG, 1989). Whereas this type of cement 

historically attracted limited interest, during the last decade it has become an attractive alternative 

to Portland cement due to its properties: low alkalinity (pH &amp;lt;11) (ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; 

VANDEPERRE, 2011; WALLING et al., 2015) and potentially good mechanical performance 

(JIANGXIONG; YIMIN; YONGXIN, 2006; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). 

The better understanding of this new fibre-cement product is crucial for the manufacture 

of more sustainable building materials since cellulosic fibres are biodegradable, renewable, demand 

low processing energy and are available around the world at lower rates with diversity of 

morphologies and dimensions (SANTOS et al., 2015b). In addition, MgO-SiO2 cements assessed in 

this thesis, in contrast to Portland cement, which requires high temperatures (about 1450oC) during 

its production, demand less energy [750oC is the maximum temperature for the controlled 

calcination to obtain reactive MgO from MgCO3 (SHAND, 2006)]. This alternative cement, would also 

allow the reuse of agro-industrial residues in to obtain amorphous silica (ANTIOHOS; PAPADAKIS; 

TSIMAS, 2014), becoming a more efficient cement from the environmental point of view. 



50 
 

 

New types of cement as magnesium oxysulfate (MOS) cements have been successfully used 

to prevent cellulosic fibres degradation over time (GOMES; CAMARINI, 2014). However, the 

mechanical results of this new kind of cement are far from those obtained with Portland cement 

products. Besides MOS cement is known to have leaching problems with time (SHAND, 2006). A new 

type of magnesia cement is presented for the production of FRCC elements from the combination 

of MgO and reactive SiO2 (MgO-SiO2 cement).   

Accelerated carbonation has been shown to be capable of improving cementitious matrices 

for fibre cement applications (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; PURNELL et al., 

2003; PIZZOL et al., 2014; SANTOS et al., 2015a). The main effect of carbonation on hydrated 

Portland cement paste is the conversion of portlandite (Ca(OH)2) into calcite (CaCO3). This reaction 

increases the density of the matrix, (FRÍAS; GOÑI, 2013; MO; ZHANG; DENG, 2015; MORANDEAU; 

THIÉRY; DANGLA, 2015; ZHA et al., 2015), making it more rigid and stronger. It also strengthens the 

fibre-matrix interface, but this can modify the fracture mechanism, often leading to a reduction in 

the energy absorbed during a flexural test, despite significant increases in the modulus of rupture 

(MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) (PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL 

et al., 2014; SANTOS et al., 2015a).  

Reactive periclase binders can also harden by carbonation, sequestering CO2 as part of the 

process of making construction materials (UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2013, 2014, 2015; VANDEPERRE; 

AL-TABBAA, 2007). When MgO is carbonated in the presence of water, HMC are produced, with 

general formula xMgCO3.Mg(OH)2.yH2O, (HMC) (BOTHA; STRYDOM, 2001; LANAS; ALVAREZ, 2004). 

These compounds bind both water and CO2 and thus create a very large additional solid volume, 

giving them a much greater potential than Portland cement in terms of overall binder efficiency. 

The transformation of brucite into HMC, identically to what occurs for Ca(OH)2 when turns into 

(CaCO3), increases strength of the hydrated pastes.  

One more particular benefit for carbonating MgO cements is the higher water demand of 

this types of cements compared to Portland cement (ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). 

This higher water demand implies a more porous matrix and therefore facilitates the transportation 

of CO2 trough the matrix. In addition to generating porous matrices, the high water demand of MgO 

cements also creates favorable conditions for the carbonation of Mg(OH)2 since a previous 

requirement for the formation of HMC is the dissolution of CO2 in water to form carbonic acid 

(H2CO3) (VANDEPERRE; AL-TABBAA, 2007). This factor has to be considered in the production of 



51 
 

 

fibre-cement as the possible addition of cellulosic fibres would increase the amount of water within 

the matrix after reinforcement dry due to the hygroscopic nature of vegetal fibres (ONUAGULUCHI; 

BANTHIA, 2016).  The release of water from vegetable fibres would increase the capillary water, 

favouring the generation of H2CO3 and promoting carbonation. 

Another aspect to be analysed is the condition for carbonation to be effective. Up to now 

the best results to accelerate carbonation on Portland cement are those achieved by supercritical 

carbonation (PURNELL; SHORT; PAGE, 2001; SANTOS et al., 2015a). From a technical point of view, 

supercritical carbonation requires high energy to reach the critical point (pressure of at least 7.38 

MPa) as well as additional sophisticated chambers to resist those reactor conditions. However, for 

HMC, it is not necessary supercritical fluids for carbonation in order to accelerate the carbonation 

reaction. This factor makes feasible the production of carbonated products with simpler 

technologies that exclusively require higher concentration of CO2.  

Although all the mentioned advantages of carbonating MgO-SiO2 systems, a debate has 

been settled recently regarding the thermodynamic stability of the produced phases as a 

consequence of carbonation (UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2013, 2016; WALLING; PROVIS, 2016). This 

factor requires a special attention and discussion to determine the viability of this new type of 

cement to be reinforced with cellulosic reinforcements. 

Sepiolite is a clay with a very characteristic fibrous structure with an empirical formula of 

Si6Mg4O15(OH)2·6H2O. This mineral has a wide range of uses due to its sorptive, optical, rheological 

and molecular sieve properties.  In cementitious materials, sepiolite is usually utilized as a 

rheological additive to enhance their features in both the fresh and the hardened state. Sepiolite 

has a thixotropic character improving workability, adherence to the substrate, pumpability and 

surface finishing (ÁLVAREZ et al., 2011). In the case of fibre-cement products, the use of this additive 

has a significant effect as rheological agent. The modification of the rheological properties of the 

fibre-cement suspensions entails better fibre distribution and better fine particles retention 

(FUENTE et al., 2010). Besides, when sepiolite is used in the fabrication of Portland cement products 

reinforced with cellulosic fibres, it enhances interlaminar bonding of the sheets, promotes an 

excellent surface finishing and presents a good compatibility with flocculants of different ionic 

charge and molecular weight (FUENTE et al., 2010; JARABO et al., 2010).  

The use of sepiolite for fibre-cement applications depends on its surface anionic charge. The 

higher anionic charge affects cement hydration by reducing the extent of oxygen atoms in the 



52 
 

 

sepiolite surface with free pairs of electrons to interact with water through hydrogen bonding 

(JARABO et al., 2014). The dispersion of sepiolite in fibre-cement is favoured by reducing the anionic 

charge of this material (JARABO et al., 2014). Dispersion of sepiolite is, therefore, related to the 

efficiency as rheological agent and as well as inhibitor of expansion cracks (JARABO et al., 2014). 

When a moderate-to-low anionic charge surface sepiolite is added in fibre-cement suspensions 

flexural properties are improved (modulus of rupture, limit of proportionality and specific energy). 

However this enhancement is not reflected on an improvement of the physical properties (density, 

porosity and water absorption) (JARABO et al., 2014). Sepiolite in fibre-cement increases the 

stability of the flocs. Besides the higher grade of flocculation of the small particles makes easier the 

flow of water through the spaces among the flocs (FUENTE et al., 2010). Sepiolite, when present in 

fibre-cement suspensions, competes with the rest of the components (cellulose mainly) to absorb 

flocculant (A-PAM), increasing the flocculation efficiency in terms of chord size and stability of the 

flocs (JARABO et al., 2010). Likewise, when sepiolite is dispersed in water either with cement or silica 

also improves flocculation by interacting with the flocculant particles (JARABO et al., 2010). 

Apart from its rheological properties, this clay is also used to reinforce cementitious 

materials due to its morphology. It is found that the addition of 10% sepiolite fibres enhances the 

mechanical properties of the mortar (compressive and bending strengths) compared to the plain 

Portland cement samples (KAVAS; SABAH; ÇELIK, 2004). Because of its needle-like shape, with a 

length of 0.2-2.0 mm, a width of 100-300 Å and a thickness of 50-100 Å, within a cement matrix, 

sepiolite fibres fill the pores in the paste. It is also proved that an optimal fibre distribution is 

necessary for a proper linkage of the fibres in the cement matrix (KAVAS; SABAH; ÇELIK, 2004). Also, 

because of the short length and the random distribution of its microfibres, it has a beneficial effect 

to reduce crack width and crack length and shrinkage cracking (KANG; SONG; KIM, 2008) and 

decrease soundness (expansion volume) and leads to a reduced shrinkage (KAVAS; SABAH; ÇELIK, 

2004). 

In the case of MgO-SiO2 FRCC with cellulosic materials, all these properties are required. 

Moreover, sepiolite has been used in lime mortars due to its absorption properties to act as a water 

reservoir in conditions of low humidity (ANDREJKOVIC?OVÁ et al., 2012) which could be 

advantageous to complete hydration of MgO-SiO2 systems that demand higher amounts of water 

compared to Portland cement. In addition, in lime mortars, this mineral addition promotes 

interlocking of mortar components, producing a denser structure and, therefore, improves the 



53 
 

 

mechanical properties at later ages. Since one of the main hydration products of MgO-SiO2-H20 

systems, poorly crystalized magnesium silicate hydrate, has the same chemical composition as 

sepiolite, it is expected to create new nucleation links between sepiolite and M-S-H gels. When lime 

mortars are improved by the addition of a pozzolan, particularly metakaolin, in addition to 

improving mechanical properties at later ages, adding sepiolite provides a wet environment for 

metakaolin, favoring the pozzolanic activity (ANDREJKOVICÔVÁ, 2011). This reactivity could be 

greater in an Mg rich environment provided during the hydration of MgO-SiO2 systems.

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

3.1 BLOCK 1 

This work is structured in two different sections. The first step aims to analyze MgO-SiO2 

systems with different formulations and their hydration reactions in the early stages. The second 

stage intends to select the optimal blended system for fibre-cement production according to the 

results of pH and mechanical performance. 

The main target is obtaining hydrated magnesium silicates (M-S-H) gels, intending to obtain 

hydration products analogous to those achieved from dicalcium silicate (C2S) and tricalcium silicate 

(C3S) hydration, but using magnesium chemistry instead of calcium.  

3.1.1 Materials preparation and characterization 

To achieve this objective, pastes made of a blend of fine powders acted as clinker-free 

cement. The two components of this blended cement are reactive magnesium oxide powder, [Q-

MAG-200-AR (AR200)], obtained by controlled calcination of MgCO3 and provided by Magnesita 

S.A., Contagem, MG, Brazil, and undensified microsilica powder type 920U with high content of 

silicon dioxide with a typical bulk density of 200-350 kg/m3, provided by Elkem ASA Materials, Sao 

Paulo, SP, Brazil. Before mixing with water, ball milling for powder homogenization is carried out at 

a ball to powder ratio of 2:1 at 1 rpm. The basic properties of these materials are shown in Table 3.

As a control cement matrix, High Early Strength Portland Cement is used (CPV-ARI, according 

to Brazilian Standards NBR 5733) to compare the pH and compressive strength results. CPV-ARI is 

selected because it is mainly constituted of clinker with no mineral additions. This condition is 

desirable to set a baseline for the comparative tests here, since in the case of mineral additions 

being present a pozzolanic reaction may take place. This may generate a less aggressive 

environment for lignocellulosic fibres due to the reduction of the portlandite and pH. 

 



56 
 

 

3.1.2 Test methods 

The evolution of pH over time is measured following the procedures of previous studies 

(ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011). 10 g of blended powders according to the formulations 

shown in Table 4 are poured into sealed glass beakers containing 100 mL of deionized water, and 

stirred. The temperature is kept constant at 30oC. pH measurements are taken 30 min after mixing 

the powders in water, then at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. For pH measurements a Digimed DM-23 

pHmeter, an Ika HS10 magnetic stirrer and an Ika ETS-D5 digital temperature controller are used.  

One of the criteria to select the best formulation is mechanical performance. In spite of the 

need for a good flexural resistant fibre-cement product, the value that represents cement strength 

in a more reliable manner is compressive strength. An adaptation of standardized mortar tests 

(ASTM C780-14, 2014) for application to pastes is taken in order to use materials in a more efficient 

way as a lower amount of material is required to achieve consistent results.  For every sample, 

including Portland cement pastes, the water to binder ratio is held constant at 0.50 in order to 

compare mechanical results regardless of water demand. For that purpose, plasticizer (Melflux 

2651F provided by Sika) is added to the samples for binary systems. Axial compressive strength is 

measured at 7 and 28 days (6 replicate cylindrical test samples, 50mm high x 25mm diameter, per 

curing time), performing the test with a 50 kN cell load and a swivel device for a uniform approach 

to the upper side of the samples. The deformation rate is 0.3 mm/min. The samples are cured in a 

sealed bag and kept in a 95% humidity box. After compressive strength testing, samples are crushed 

into powder and immersed in acetone for 5 days and then dried at 65oC until constant mass. Then, 

only particles through a 63?m size mesh were considered for testing. Hydration is also stopped for 

bigger pieces.  Fragments of around 5mm length are embedded in epoxy resin mixed in a 7:1 resin 

to hardener ratio and, after hardening, polished with diffent grit size (9, 3 and 1 ?m respectively) 

silicon carbide pads for 6 minutes at 300rpm and 10N·m.   

Mineralogical analysis by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) is carried out using powder 

samples, using an X-ray diffractometer Horiba LA-960, scanning between 5-65o 2? at 10 o/min. 

Rietveld analysis is performed using PDXL-2 software. Thermogravimetry tests (TG) are conducted 

with a Netzch STA 440 F3 Jupiter instrument in alumina crucibles under atmosphere of nitrogen set 

at a flow rate of 60 mL/min, from 25 to 1000 oC at a heating rate of 10 oC/min. In order to replicate 

and characterize the expected M-S-H gel, a gel with a Mg/Si molar ratio of 0.50 is synthesized via a 

precipitation method according to prior work (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; 



57 
 

 

CHEESEMAN, 2014) using solutions of sodium metasilicate pentahydrate (Na2SiO3·5H2O) and 

magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O). This gel is used as a thermogravimetric reference, 

with a low Mg content to avoid Mg(OH)2 contamination via an excess of Mg during the precipitation.   

For infrared spectroscopy a NEXUS 670 spectrometer from Nicolet Instrument Corporation 

is used, observing wavenumbers between 4000 and 400 cm-1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

images are collected with a Hitachi TM3000 microscope, and EDS measurements are conducted with 

a SwiftED3000, Oxford Instruments. The acceleration voltage used for the SEM analysis is 15 kV. 

 

3.2 BLOCK 2 

3.2.1 Materials preparation and characterization 

An cement matrix (MgO-SiO2 cement) to PC is produced using 60 wt% lightly burned 

magnesium oxide (MgO) and 40wt% silica fume (SF), based on Block 1 results. In order to compare 

results with a reference material, Brazilian ordinary Portland cement (PC) CPV-ARI (high early 

strength), equivalent to Type I as defined in ASTM-C150 (ASTM C150/C150M, 2012) is chosen 

because of its finer particle size and higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements 

available in the Brazilian market, apart from the absence of mineral additions. This condition is 

desirable since in case of mineral addition present in the matrix, a pozzolanic reaction may take 

place. This would generate a less aggressive environment for the fibres due to the reduction of the 

portlandite and pH. Following the procedure of fibre-cement industry, the cementitious material is 

replaced in 25% by mass of Itaú limestone, produced by Votorantim Cimentos (Santa Helena, SP, 

Brazil). Powder materials properties are summarized in Table 5. This replacement is carried out in 

order to reduce the cost of fibre-cement production and improve dimension stability generated by 

high shrinkage levels due to an excess of cement. For the production of the FRCC, considering the 

most common pulps used by paper industry in Brazil, two different types of fibres are used:  

Unbleached Pine pulp, provided by OJSC Solombala Pulp-and-Paper Mill, Arkhangelsk, Russia, and 

Bleached Eucalyptus pulp, provided by Fibria, Jacarei, SP, Brazil. Chemical characterization is shown 

in Table 6 and fibre length and width distribution is presented in  

Figure 10. In both cases, vegetable fibres are presented in dry laminar sheets with 

approximately 5% RH. In order to obtain the fibres, after 48 h in water immersion, it is necessary to 

disintegrate them by stirring in water for 25 min using a cellulosic pulp mixer Tedemix MRF31450.

Cellulose fibres are refined in order to obtain a better malleability, fibrillate the fibre surface 

and develop a good adhesion with cementitious matrix and higher flexural strength of the 

composites (COUTTS, 2005; TONOLI et al., 2010). The CSF test is a widely accepted standard 

measure of the drainage properties of pulp suspensions and it relates well to the initial drainage 

rate of the wet pulp pad during the dewatering process. It is considered the higher the CSF values 

the lower the refining level of the pulp. Pulps in water slurry (25 g / L) are processed in a flat disks 

refiner Bruno, model 2RA-12, until a Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF) value of 573 for bleached 

eucalyptus and 36 for unbleached pine. CSF values are determined after each refining level following 

TAPPI T 227 om-99 (TAPPI 1999) Standard. Fibre size characterization ( 



59 
 

 

Figure 10) is carried out by an adaptation of the TAPPI T271 Standard, where an optical 

microscope (Axio Lab.A1) and software (AxioVision) are used to capture and measure the fibre 

dimensions respectively.

3.2.2 Composites formulation and preparation 

FRCC (flat pads) measuring 200 mm x 200 mm and an thickness of around 6-mm are 

produced at laboratory scale using slurry DPM process, as described in details by Savastano et al. 

(SAVASTANO JR.; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2000). DPM technique is schematically displayed in Figure 8, 

where 330 g of dry solid materials following the composition established in  

Table 7 are mixed in 1500ml of water at 3000rpm , Figure 8 (a), and then transferred to a 

casting box (b) are 0.5MPa compacting pressure is applied (c) and after vacuum drainage (550mm 

Hg) for 2min (d). Once most of the water is removed and flat surfaces are achieved (e), the thin 

sheets are placed between steel plates and 3MPa compacting pressure is applied for 5min (f).

The different water to binder ratios achieved for each formulation are shown in Table 8. 

Pads are wet cut into four 165 mm × 40 mm flexural test specimens using a water-cooled diamond 

saw.  

3.2.3 Test methods 

4 point bending tests are performed after curing and ageing using a testing machine EMIC 

DL 3000 equipped with 1 kN load cell and a deflectometer. The deflection values are divided by the 

major span (135 mm) of the bending test, and considers (?) as specific deflection. Four-point 

bending configuration is employed to determine the different flexural properties with a deflection 

speed of 5mm/min.

Samples are kept immersed in water for saturated curing at 25oC until 28 days of age. After 

controlled curing until the age of 28 days, the composites are exposed to accelerated aging cycles. 

The accelerated aging cycles aims to speed up natural weathering using soaking and drying cycles, 

which allows a better understanding of the long-term behaviour of the composites. Specimens are 

successively immersed into water at 20 ± 5oC for 170 min and, after an interval of 10min, they are 

heated to the temperature of 60 ± 5oC for 170 min in a ventilated oven. Another interval of 10 min 

at room temperature also preceded the subsequent cycle, as recommended by the EN 494:2012 

Standard (EN 494:2012+A1:2015, 2012). Each cycle finished when one soak and dry is completed 

and the samples are submitted to 200 accelerated aging cycles 

The physical properties, bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) are obtained following 

procedures specified by the ASTM C 948 Standard (1981). The polished (previously embedded in 

cold-setting resin with the same procedured used in Block 1 section 3.1.1) and fractured surfaces of 

specimens resulting from the mechanical tests are examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) 

with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), using Quanta 600 FEG (FEI, Eindhoven, the 

Netherlands) with an acceleration voltage 15 kV.  

3.3 BLOCK 3 

3.3.1 Materials preparation and characterization 

As previously applied in Block 2, MgO-SiO2 cement is used as a blend of lightly burned MgO 

(60%) and silica fume (40%) based on Block 1 results or (MÁRMOL et al., 2016). Based on Block 2, 

section 3.2.2, the cementitious material is replaced in 25% by mass using ground limestone, Itaú 

produced by Votorantim Cimentos (Santa Helena, SP, Brazil). The properties of MgO, SiO2 and 

limestone used in this research are identical as used in Block 2, section 3.2.1. With the intention of 



62 
 

 

reproducing the conditions used by fibre-cement industry, similar mix design is used. As reinforcing 

elements both synthetic and vegetable polymeric reinforcements are used. Synthetic reinforcement 

concentration is of 2% by mass of the composite (5.82% by volume). In this study polypropylene 

(PP) fibres (H 216, Braskem, with a density of 0.905 g·cm-3, a flexural modulus -1% secant- of 1.4GPa, 

tensile strength of 36MPa and elongation at break of 9%) are used to evaluate their capacity as 

alternative reinforcement to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres. The use of synthetic fibres in this study 

is due to the length of this type of fibres  (around 10 mm). Using longer fibres assures enough 

anchorage in case of deficient matrix-fibre adherence. Pine pulp described in Block 2, section 3.2.1 

is used.  Refinement is used to change the morphological properties of the cellulose pulp for a better 

capture of the mineral particles during the drainage of excess water from the pad under formation 

in the Hatschek process, improving the adherence of the fibres with the matrix (TONOLI et al., 

2009a). 

The formulation of the composites is chosen with the intention of reproducing the 

proportions usually utilized by the fibre-cement industry as shown in Table 9.

Samples for bending and physical tests are produced according to Block 2, section 3.2.3. 

 

3.3.2 Curing treatments 

According to Szczerba et al. (2013), MgO-SiO2-H2O systems are highly influenced by curing 

temperature, where hydration reactions are accelerated at temperatures over 30oC. Then, after 

initial curing at 25oC for 24 h in a sealed plastic bag, water steam curing at 55oC for 7 days is applied 

(Figure 11). For carbonation curing, after first 24 h, samples are placed in an environmental chamber  

(ESPEC-brand, EPL-4H model) for 48 h with a CO2 concentration of 20% by volume, keeping RH at 

90% and temperature at 45oC (Figure 11). This temperature is chosen as higher temperatures 



63 
 

 

accelerate the hydration kinetics and consequently would obstruct the diffusion of CO2. After the 

carbonation cycle, a period of 5 days of steam curing at 55oC is carried out (Figure 11). After the 

steam curing for both carbonated and non-carbonated samples, specimens are kept in water for 48 

h to complete saturation for wet flexural and physical tests.

3.3.3 Ageing treatment 

Accelerated cycles are used to evaluate the composites performance after ageing. This 

technique aims to speed up natural weathering using soaking and drying cycles. Accelerated ageing 

cycles are described in Block 2, section 3.2.3. Each cycle finishes when one soak and dry is completed 

and the samples are submitted to 100 accelerated aging cycles. This ageing treatment is used to 

submit samples to extreme weathering conditions evaluate thermodynamic stability of HMC.  

 

3.3.4 Test methods 

Four point bending tests are performed according to Block 2, section 3.2.3. After mechanical 

testing, aliquots of each sample are crushed and immersed in acetone to stop hydration reactions 

and later dried at 60oC. Crushed samples are prepared as described in Block 1, section 3.1.1, to 

perform X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric characterization at different ages. X-ray 

difractometer Horiba LA-960 (CuK? radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA, between 

5-65o with a speed of 10o/min) and a Netzch STA 440 F3 Jupiter TG equipment under an inert 

atmosphere of nitrogen set at a flow rate of 60 mL/min and performed from 25 to 1000oC at a 



64 
 

 

heating rate of 10oC/min. The physical properties, bulk density (BD) and water absorption (WA) are 

obtained following procedures specified by the ASTM C 1185 Standards (2012)(ASTM C1185-08, 

2012). The fractured surfaces of specimens resulting from the mechanical tests are resin coated as 

described in Block 1 and examined by backscattered electron microscopy (SEM) and Scanning 

Electron Microscopy with X-ray microanalysis (EDS), using Quanta 600 FEG (FEI, Eindhoven, the 

Netherlands) with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV.

3.4.1 Materials preparation and characterization 

In the present work, two types of cement systems are studied: Portland Cement (CEM I 

meeting EN 197?1:2000 Standard) and the MgO-SiO2 cement employed in Block 2, Block 3 or 

(MÁRMOL et al., 2016). Limestone filler (CaCO3) is also used in the compositions for flocculation 

study to recreate analogous conditions as used in Block 2 and Block 3. The two types of sepiolite 

used in this study are provided by TOLSA GROUP and are defined in Table 10: CIMSIL and PANGEL, 

both either delaminated or undelamited for flocculation assessment.

To study suspensions flocculation, cement and fibre-cement suspensions in water are mixed 

according to Table 11. Delamination consists in high-energy Ultraturrax stirring at 10000 rpm for 10 

min in order to assure a colloidal system and the proper dispersion of sepiolite needles. APAM is 

used as a flocculant (Praestrol 1225). Cellulose is added to the suspensions according to Table 11 to 

replicate fibre-cement suspensions. Hornificated pine pulp (from pulp described in Block 2, section 

3.2.1) is used as fibre source to avoid excessive water absorption of the cellulosic material during 



65 
 

 

the fibre-cement production. Four hornification cycles are used following the procedure described 

by Ballesteros et al. (2015).

3.4.2 Test methods 

Since one of the main hydration products of MgO-SiO2-H2O systems is a poorly crystalized 

magnesium silicate hydrate with similar chemical composition as sepiolite [Mg4Si6O15(OH)2·6H2O], it 

is expected to create new nucleation links between sepiolite and M-S-H gels. In order to explore this 

hypothesis, Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction and Thermogravimetry analysis are 

carried out on hardened slurry samples that are also vacuum filtered (500 mm of Hg) after mixing 

18.4g of MgO-SiO2 powder in 100 g of water for 5 min. After 10 days of steam curing at 55oC, 

hardened paste samples are used for cement characterization.  

For XRD tests, pastes are finely crushed and sieved, using the particle fraction passing 

through 63 ?m mesh. X’Pert Pro MPD PANalytical’s X-ray diffractometer is used (Cu Ka radiation of 

1.54 Å) to collect data between 5o and 65o. The thermal analysis (TG/DTG) of the samples is carried 

out in nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL/min) from 35 to 1000oC using a Seiko Exstar 6000 TGA/DTA 

thermobalance. SEM analysis is performed on a JSM 6335F electron microscope, JEOL brand with 

an intensity of 10 kV. The effect of sepiolite addition on the flexural performance of the MgO-SiO2 

cement is examined by elastic dynamic modulus (DMOE) analysis as an adaptation of the ASTM 

C1548 – 02 (2007) Standard (ASTM C1548 - 02, 2007), using a SONELASTIC® equipment, ATCP brand, 

Brazil . For ultrasound tests, 50 x 40 x 5 mm samples are casted and placed in a steam bath at 55oC 

for curing. DMOE is recorded over time and bulk density after 24 h of curing for every formulation.

Cement replacements of 1 and 2% by mass are used for both types of sepiolite. All samples are 

mixed in water (water to binder ratio of 0.5). For MgO-SiO2 samples, 1% by mass of MELFLUX 2651F 

superplasticizer is used. 

In order to test flocculation for the different suspensions, the procedure detailed by Fuente 

et al (2010) is applied. This process, summarized in Table 12, is applied by focused beam reflectance 

measurement technique (FBRM), using a M500L probe (Mettler Toledo, Seatle, USA). Thus, 

suspensions in 400 g of water are produced and analysed, mixing 18.4 g of different powder and 

powder-fibre solids in accordance with Table 11. Chord length distribution is recorded over time for 

all the compositions. 

For water retention analysis, the method of Fuente et al. (2010) is also considered but the 

saturation in calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2]. In this test, with the aim of obtaining a calcium free 

system that avoids cellulose degradation (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; TOLEDO FILHO 

et al., 2009) only MilliQ water is used. Subsequently, the different suspensions are submitted to 

vacuum drainage at 500 mm of Hg and water retention values are recorded over time to study the 

effect of the different sepiolite formulations during this fibre-cement manufacture stage.

Fibre-cement thin sheets of approximately 6 mm thickness are produced to carry out 4-

point bending tests according to Block 2, section 3.2.3 or (MÁRMOL; SAVASTANO, 2017). For fibre-



68 
 

 

cement composites flexural testing, 280 g of solids, meeting the same proportions as noted in Table 

11, are used following the DPM technique described in Block 2, section 3.2.2. 

After compaction, samples are cured for 5 days at 55oC and 90% relative humidity. Then 

pads are cut into 160 x 40 mm specimens. After 2 days of water immersion for saturated testing, 

samples are tested as indicated in Block 2, section 3.2.3 or (MÁRMOL et al., 2016). The same 

procedure is used to carry out the physical tests in accordance to ASTM C1185-08 (ASTM C1185-08, 

2012) Standards. For Scanning Electron Microscopy test, after flexural testing, composite samples 

are cut into 1 x 1 x 1 cm cubes and embedded in epoxy resin. SEM samples preparation is conducted 

as described in Block 1 section 3.1.1. A Quanta 600 FEG microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands) 

is used.  

Since the effects of sepiolite addition on PC cement composites reinforced with cellulosic 

fibres has been already studied (JARABO et al., 2014), PC are just used as control samples (with no 

addition of sepiolite).

3.5.1 Materials preparation and characterization 

Sisal fibres (Agave sisalana) as harvested in Pocinhos (Paraíba, Brazil), were used for this 

study. Without any treatment, unaged sisal fibres were cut to 4 cm length and individually 

embedded in cement paste prisms. For this study, high early strength Portland cement (CPV-ARI 

according to Brazilian Standards, equivalent to Type III as defined in ASTM-C150 (ASTM 

C150/C150M, 2012, p. 150) and Mg-SiO2 cement, previously used in Block 2, section 3.2.1.  A water 

to cement ratio of 1 was used to assure a proper moulding of the prims and generate an excess of 

water for higher porosity and therefore higher alkaline medium. Two different ageing treatments 

were applied to the cement prisms: 1) 5 months of ageing of the prisms inside a sealed plastic bag 

at 25oC and 65% RH and 2) 400 accelerated ageing cycles for a rapid study of a simulated long-term 

ageing. Accelerated ageing cycles are conducted according to Block 2, section 3.2.3. 

After these ageing treatments, cement prims were mechanically crushed so fibres were 

detached and then different techniques were used to assess sisal fibres degradation.

3.5.2 Test methods 

Thermogravimetric study was performed in a METLER TOLEDO TGA/SDTA851e with 

simultaneous thermal analyser. Temperature was linearly increase at a pace of a 10?C/min from 25 

to 800?C, with flow rates of 50 mL/min, in oxygen atmosphere inside alumina crucibles. During 

holocellulose decomposition, Activation Energy (E) was calculated from Arrhenius equation (18) that 

relates the reaction rate (k) and pre-exponential factor (A), universal gas constant (R) and the 

absolute temperature (T): 

?(?) = ?·???(
??

??
)  (18) 

 

Two methods for this calculation were used: 1) differential method (reference) where 

Activation Energy is calculated as in Equation (19)

Where ? is the sample mass at time t, ?0 is the initial sample weight and ?? is the final

A Bruker D2PHASER diffractometer equipped with a CuKa radiation (1.54056 Å) and source 

operated at 30 kV and 15 mA was used to irradiate finely chopped (1 mm length) sisal fibres. The 

resulting diffractogram was registered by scanning the samples from 10o to 40o (2?) in 0.02o steps 

at a rate of 0.3?/min. 

 



70 
 

 

The crystallinity index, Ic(%), was calculated for every treatment also by two different 

methods:  

1) using the equation (22) proposed by Segal (SEGAL et al., 1959): 

Ic(%) =
Iam
Imax

 x 100 (22) 

 

Where Imax is the maximum intensity of the (200) lattice reflection of cellulose I? type, 

located at 2? between 22 and 23?, and Iam is the intensity attributed to amorphous part, given at 

2? between 18?and 19? for I??cellulose; and  

2) by dividing the diffractogram area due to crystalline cellulose by the total area of the original 

diffractogram. For this method, amorphous cellulose from the diffractogram of the whole sample 

was subtracted with the aid of TOPAS software in order to establish crystalline fraction (PARK et al., 

2010). 

The crystallite size was determined by the Scherrer equation (LANGFORD; WILSON, 1978) 

according to Equation (23), 

d =
k?

?cos?
 (23) 

 

Where d is the perpendicular size to the lattice plane represented by the peak (200), k is the 

constant related to the shape of the crystallites and the indices of the reflecting plane, k is the 

wavelength of the incident beam in the diffraction experiment, ? is the peak width at half maximum 

(PWHM) in radians and ? is the position of the peak (half of the plotted 2 h value). For Scanning 

Electron Microscopy (SEM) tests, sisal fibres were embedded in epoxy resin to reproduce the state 

of the fibres cross section within a binding material. After resin hardening, samples were firstly 

polished with abrasive silicon carbide and then with alumina until smooth surface was achieved. 

Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) ZEISS Brand, ULTRA 55 model, was equipped 

with microanalysis by EDS from Oxford Instruments Ltda.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

4.1 BLOCK 1 

4.1.1 XRD characterization 

In Figure 12, XRD patterns for all the samples are depicted. For every sample, it can be seen 

that peaks corresponding to brucite have a higher intensity when compared to peaks matching 

reflections of periclase. This implies that most of the MgO has either been hydrated to form Mg(OH)2 

or reacted to form M-S-H, with a hydration degree close to completion (up to 98% for samples with 

lower MgO content by Rietveld refinement). As expected, formulations with higher contents of MgO 

show more intense peaks corresponding to both periclase and brucite, as there is less opportunity 

for conversion to M-S-H in these instances, and thus a lower degree of reaction. The most 

remarkable difference between samples at 7 and 28 days is that the peaks corresponding to 

periclase (at 43 and 62o) decrease with time for every system. According to literature (ALI; KOTP; EL-

NAGGAR, 2010; BREW; GLASSER, 2005; JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; RASHID et 

al., 2009; ROOSZ et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 1998, 2005; 

ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014), magnesium 

silicate hydrated formed from a mixture of MgO and silica rich powder in the presence of water 

shows highly disordered characteristics with broad peaks throughout the diffraction pattern range. 

Two minor, broad peaks are evident here at 33–39° and 58–61° 2?. Another expected broad peak 

corresponding to magnesium silicate hydrate is supposed to appear between 25-30° 2??but in this 

case it overlaps with the broad hump due to unreacted silica. These features confirm the presence 

of M-S-H gels (ALI; KOTP; EL-NAGGAR, 2010; BREW; GLASSER, 2005; JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; 

LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; RASHID et al., 2009; ROOSZ et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; 

TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 2005; WALLING et al., 2015; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 

2014).

Figure 13 shows an enlarged view of selected key regions of Figure 12 for every formulation. 

Parts of the regions where features arising from M-S-H gel are expected have been omitted since 

they overlapped with unreacted silica peaks, so Figure 13 illustrates just the regions where only gel 

bumps are manifest (33-37° and 59.5-61.5° 2?). Both regions show a broad hump corresponding to 

the M-S-H gel XRD patterns obtained in previous studies, confirming the presence of the gel. 

Nevertheless the intensity of these humps is not as high as it is found in previous works. This may 

be explained by the fact that M-S-H gel is not the only main phase present in the matrix, in contrast 

to what is intended in previous reports where synthesized magnesium silicate is the only constituent 

(BREW; GLASSER, 2005; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 1998; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; 

CHEESEMAN, 2014). In the two regions, between 35-39° and 58-61° 2?, the intensity of the humps 

for most of the formulations is slightly higher for 28 day cured samples, suggesting that the 

development of the gel have been ongoing over time. According to literature Mg(OH)2 content tends 

to decrease with time, although there is little systematic variation observed here due to the 

replenishment of Mg(OH)2 by ongoing hydration of remnant MgO. It can be assumed that Mg(OH)2 

reacts with SiO2 to form more gel (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LIAO; SENNA, 1993; LOTHENBACH et al., 

2015; ROOSZ et al., 2015; SANDBERG; MOSBERG, 1989; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; 



73 
 

 

MACKENZIE, 1998, 2005; WALLING et al., 2015; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). This 

phenomenon may be accelerated by pretreatment of the MgO-SiO2 powder, either mechanical 

(grinding) or chemical (use of deflocculants such as sodium phosphates), that contribute to the 

reduction of the crystallization degree of Mg(OH)2 and therefore improve dissolution in aqueous 

environments.

4.1.2 TG characterization 

Figure 14 shows thermogravimetric curves for hydrated MgO and synthetic M-S-H gel at 28 

days and their differential curves. From the differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves it is possible 

to distinguish clearly two endothermic peaks, one below 300oC corresponding to the synthesized gel 

and, another one corresponding to Mg(OH)2, between 300 and 550oC. These two peaks have been 

found by other authors that produced M-S-H gels (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; 

ROOSZ et al., 2015; WALLING et al., 2015; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). These two 

peaks match perfectly the peaks produced by TG analysis of calcium silicate hydrate and calcium 

hydroxide, the main products obtained during the hydration of tri-calcium silicate (C3S) and bi-



74 
 

 

calcium silicate (C2S), which together make up 75–80% of Portland cement (RAMACHANDRAN, 

2003). Also from Figure 14 it is depicted another tiny endothermic peak at around 750oC, in the DTG 

curve of M-S-H gel but it has been neglected for phase determination. 

In Figure 15, it is displayed TG and DTG analysis for every assessed formulation containing 

MgO - SiO2 at 7 and 28 days. In this figure it is also possible to identify the two main peaks obtained 

in Figure 14, concluding that the major hydrated phases present in this type of material are Mg(OH)2 

and M-S-H gel. These results are very similar to those obtained after the hydration of synthetic C3S 

and C2S, where similar peaks where obtained at the same range of temperatures for Ca(OH)2 and C-

S-H gel (GOÑI et al., 2010). The only difference is that in the case of M-S-H gel the first endothermic 

peak is centered between 110 and 135oC, instead of 75oC for both C-S-H gels (GOÑI et al., 2010). In 

this way, at initial stages, it is likely to associate the mass loss to weakly adsorbed surface water and 

water bound to exchangeable cations in the gel when the mass loss is produced below 300 and over 

550oC. This is also in agreement with other authors (SZCZERBA et al., 2013; WALLING et al., 2015; 

ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). From Zhang et al. TG analysis, where until 14 days the 

principal mass loss is produced below 300oC, the increase in water content means a higher M-S-H 

gel content since the higher amount of water the higher XRD intensity of the bumps. 

Figure 14- TG and DTG graphs of the hydrated MgO (AR200) and M-S-H gel with a 0.5 Mg/Si ratio

75 
 

 

The same way it is reasonable to estimate the amount of Mg(OH)2 present in the samples 

by considering the mass loss between 300 and 550oC mainly due to the dehydroxilation of Mg(OH)2 

(TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 1998), as follows: 

Mg(OH)2 ? MgO+H2O 13 

 

After such considerations, results of mass loss displayed in Table 13 are obtained from 

Figure 15. In accordance with XRD results (Figure 12), from these results it is also inferred that the 

higher content in MgO, the higher content in Mg(OH)2 for both 7 and 28 days. This amount of 

Mg(OH)2 for every formulation does not increase from 7 to 28 days. Contrarily to Mg(OH)2 results, 

the content on M-S-H increases with the lower content of MgO at 7 days. However, at 28 days, the 

higher content on magnsium silicate hydrated is achieved by the 60% MgO – 40% SiO2 system.

4.1.3 FT-IR characterization 

FT-IR results in Figure 16 show that the systems containing MgO and SiO2 present a similar 

spectra to systems with 100% MgO for every formulation, proving the great influence of Mg(OH)2 

structure in the hydrated pastes.  Brucite is the main hydration product expected for a powder with 

97.4% MgO purity, In addition. It is a member of the group of minerals known as the layer 

hydroxides, whose structures show similarities to the layer and chain silicates as well as the basic 

building unit of all the layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure minerals (KAMATH; ANNAL 

THERESE; GOPALAKRISHNAN, 1997).  Thus, it is uncertain to establish which vibrational bands 

belong to Mg(OH)2 and which ones to M-S-H gel. 100% MgO hydrated samples, at both 7 and 28 

days, show bands around between 3000-3700, 1600, 1400 and 1040 cm-1 that are accurately 

reproduced for every MgO-SiO2 samples. For 100% MgO samples the broadening peak from 3300 

to 3600 cm-1 and the peak at 1600 cm-1 are derivable from H-bonding of coordinated water (ALI; 

KOTP; EL-NAGGAR, 2010; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015) due to an excess of adsorbed water molecules 

on the MgO surface, as the 0.5 w/c exceeds the water requirement for MgO hydration. The sharp 

absorbance near 3696 cm-1 is a characteristic Mg–OH stretch and around 1400 and 1040 cm-1 Mg-

OH bend is also depicted (HANNA, 1965; BRATERMAN, 2006; TEMUUJIN; OKADA; MACKENZIE, 

1998). In the literature the peak at 1040 cm-1 also reveals Si–O–Si vibrations of the tetrahedral 

sheets within the talc structure (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; WALLING et al., 2015). The sharp peak in 

3696 cm-1 is more prominent for samples with a higher content in MgO which is coincident with 

previous results. In previous works with M-S-H gels, at 1640 cm-1 (ALI; KOTP; EL-NAGGAR, 2010) and 

1400 cm-1 (BREW; GLASSER, 2005), identical bonds are present (OH stretching) and at approximately 



77 
 

 

1040 cm-1 a strong band is present due to Si–O–Si symmetrical stretching vibrations (JIN; AL-

TABBAA, 2014; RASHID et al., 2009; WALLING et al., 2015), hindering the identification of the phases.

Although all the similarities in the spectrograph from 1000-4000 cm-1, clear differences arise 

from 400 to 1000 cm-1 between the 100% MgO and the MgO-SiO2 systems. For the MgO-SiO2 

systems, a sharp peak around 672cm-1 arises from to Si–O bending vibrations (LOTHENBACH et al., 

2015) while Mg–O vibrations occur at 455 cm-1 (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; ALI; KOTP; EL-NAGGAR, 

2010). However these bonds show no modifications for MgO-SiO2 samples over time and remain 

alike at 7 and 28 days, being complicated to establish whether phases concentration stay at equal 

levels or gels with LDH are formed from Mg(OH)2.

M, S and H represent the concentration of raw materials mixed, correcting the molarity 

according to powders purity, to yield the different hydration products (MgO, SiO2 and H2O 

respectively), MH stands for brucite which is determined as described in Section 3.2, Mu, Su and Hu 

refer to the amount of unreacted raw materials. Unreacted silica and water have been calculated as 

the difference between the original concentrations of raw materials and the concentration of these 

molecules in the M-S-H and MH molecules. Mu concentration has been obtained from Rietveld 

analysis, where periclase peaks have been compared between 100% AR200 MgO samples and the 

different MgO-SiO2 systems. H in M-S-H has been quantified from TG analysis, considering water 

molecules released below 300 and over 550 oC. M in M-S-H has been estimated as the difference 

between the original concentration before mixing and the MgO present in MH and Mu. With the 

help of EDS analysis (Table 15), MgO/SiO2 is determined in the M-S-H particles so it is also possible 

to determine S in M-S-H. It is important to remark that Hu represents a surplus of water required 

for mixing and good workability. This excess of water is evaporated in the drying process, generating 

voids in the matrix (capillary porosity). Figure 17 displays the mass fraction distribution at 7 and 28 

days, calculated from Table 15.

The aspect of the hydrated paste at 28 days of the 60%MgO-40%SiO2 system polished 

surface is given at Figure 18(a). The microstructure, as confirmed in preliminary tests, is mainly 

comprised by Mg(OH)2 crystal particles dispersed in a M-S-H gel matrix. Mg(OH)2 particles present 

two equal dimensions sections with very defined corners. In Figure 18(b), the same image as in 

Figure 18(a) is edited with the help of EDS mapping to clearly identify the different phases in the 

cement. In yellow, the brucite particles have been thresholded and in blue, the M-S-H gel. Tiny white 

particles correspond to unreacted silica particles.  Darker blue zones match the impurities present 

in the MgO powder.

The interface between Mg(OH)2 crystals and M-S-H gel has also been highlighted in grey. 

Using EDS mapping it is possible to establish that the interface has a high concentration of Si 

molecules. Considering the Mg(OH)2 crystals as almost non Si concentration region, on the

According to hydration of MgO reaction mechanism (FEITKNECHT; BRAUN, 1967; 

FRUHWIRTH et al., 1985), water is chemisorbed on MgO to form a liquid layer on the surface. Then 

water reacts with the MgO to form a surface layer of Mg(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 subsequently dissolves 

in the water layer and, only after layer becomes saturated, precipitation takes places. In the 

meantime plenty of OH- cations are released promoting the dissolution of SiO2 into silicic acid form 

[Si(OH)4] and anion ?Si-O- ion (ALEXANDER; HESTON; ILER, 1954) which increase the concentration 

of Si surrounding Mg(OH)2 crystals that can be seen in Images 1 and 2. The presence of Mg2+ cations 

neutralizes these anions charges. The apparition of the –Si–O–Mg2+ linkage does not allow the 

reverse reaction to form siloxane bonds. Since this work is focused only on the early hydration 

stages, it is difficult to predict the evolution of the reaction over time. However, in the light of 

previous works where ageing until 90 and 180 days is studied (SZCZERBA et al., 2013; JIN; AL-

TABBAA, 2014), Mg(OH)2 is expected to continue to react with the unreacted silica to form more M-

S-H gel. For longer curing time, TG curves tend to be smoother indicating the continuous transition 



81 
 

 

from brucite to M–S–H in the region between 300 and 550oC. Also from TG curves, in which 

synthesized gels have been used (LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; ROOSZ et al., 2015), it can be deduced 

that at this range of temperatures (300-550oC) gel dehydroxylation takes place, suggesting that OH- 

ions from Mg(OH)2 end up as a part of the poor crystallized structure of the magnesium silicate 

hydrate by replacing part of the silicate chains. 

4.1.6 Matrix selection for fibre-cement purposes: pH evaluation and compressive strength analysis 

From Figure 19 it can be seen that all the samples containing MgO present notoriously lower 

pH values compared to PC samples, confirming a lower concentration of OH- ions in the matrix. 

Meanwhile Control sample keeps stable pH values with time (12.80-13.00), MgO samples present a 

descent value of pH for all the formulations. In so far as MgO is increased in the MgO-SiO2 

formulations, the pH values do not decrease as much as it happens for samples with lower contents 

in MgO since their higher content in hydroxyls. It can be observed that the most important reduction 

of pH occurs between 1 and 7 days. From that age, only 50% MgO – 50% SiO2 samples present a pH 

decrease until the age of 21 days, when it gets stabilized. pH results are consistent with previous 

works where MgO-SiO2 systems are analyzed (ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011), obtaining 

pH values below 10 at 28 days. In addition, samples containing 60% of MgO and 40% of SiO2 have a 

pH value around 10 at 7 days and decreases with time to reach a pH value of 9.8. This reduced 

alkalinity could be very advantageous since pH values below 11 at early stages help to prevent 

cellulosic fibre degradation (MÁRMOL et al., 2013).

Figure 20 shows the compressive strength results. At 7 days, it appears to be a slight 

enhancement of the mechanical strength with the increase of the MgO in the samples. This 

difference is statically significant (Table 16) when the MgO content varies from 60 to 70%, so it can 

be concluded that at 7 days of curing samples containing 50 and 60% of MgO and 70 and 80% have 

similar values. At this same age, PC samples have significant higher values compared to almost every 

samples with MgO. The only sample with an equivalent performance is 80% MgO – 20% SiO2.

and 28 days

However at 28 days, all the formulations containing MgO have at least the same 

performance that Control samples have. It is also remarkable that all the MgO-SiO2 samples present 

a strength improvement for every formulation, in contrast to Control samples which have no 

statistic considerable variation. 60% MgO – 40% SiO2 and 70% MgO – 30% SiO2 systems have the 

highest values, 71.8 and 71.4 MPa respectively, showing a statistical difference with the rest of the 

samples. These values are also around 30% higher compared to PC samples, with an average 

compressive strength of 54.5 MPa. This fact may be explained because of the excessive water to 

cement ratio used (0.5) to mold Portland cement pastes. The majority authors appear to have fixed 

with the remark that complete hydration is not possible if w/c is below 0.38 although it has been 

reported total hydration even in pastes with w/c = 0.22 (TAYLOR, 1997). However a w/c = 0.5 is not 

disproportionate for MgO-SiO2 systems, according to Lothenbach et al. (2015), who establishes that 

M-S-H gels present a silicate sheet structure and a higher amount of chemically bound water 

compared to Portland cement.

Considering Figure 21, it is reasonable to establish a relation between compressive strength 

and both free water and total amount of hydrated phases in the systems. The less free water in the 

matrix leads to higher compressive strength. This is in line with what happens with other types of 

inorganic cement as Portland cement (TAYLOR, 1997; LEA; HEWLETT, 2004), where an increase of 

porosity leads to a drastic decrease of mechanical properties. Another clear trend related to 

compressive strength is the relation between compressive strength and total amount of hydrated 

phases. This relation is especially evident at 28 days Figure 21b, where compressive strength and 

total amount of hydrated phases match in an accurate manner. Also it is possible to infer that all 

the samples with MgO have a compressive strength at 28 days to compressive strength at 7 days 

ratio (Rc28d/Rc7d in Table 16) higher than Control samples. This ratio has a precise coincidence with 

the amount of hydrated phases in the pastes. This fact is an interesting evidence to conclude that 

the amount of M-S-H is not the only determinant factor to obtain more resistant cements at initial 

stages.

Attending to the relationship between compressive strength and the Mg/Si ratio for the 

different formulations (Figure 22), at 7 days it is possible to detect how the higher Mg/Si ratio implies 

a higher compressive strength. However this trend is not displayed at 28 days, where the 

formulation with highest Mg/Si ratio (80% MgO – 80% SiO2) presents the lowest mechanical 

performance. All which can be deduced from Figure 22 is that the formulations with the uppermost 

strength for both ages, 7 and 28 days, present a Mg/Si ratio ranging from 0.8-1.2, according to what 

is pointed out at the literature (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; 

WALLING et al., 2015).  This difference in Mg/Si content may be associated to a change in M-S-H gel 

structure (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; WALLING et al., 2015), achieving a more 

resistant structure (Q3 silica tetrahedral) for Mg/Si ratios around 0.8-1.2.

In view of the pH and compressive strength results, in order to choosing the optimal matrix 

to produce fibre-cement products reinforced with lignocellulosic fibres, the system that would offer 

the lowest pH value is the 50% MgO – 50% SiO2 formulation. However this formulation has 

approximately 30% less of compressive strength compared with the 60% MgO – 40% SiO2 

formulation and besides the difference in pH between this two formulations is not very noteworthy. 

Since the formulation that offers a better compromise between alkalinity and mechanical 

properties, the most promising formulation selected is the 60-40. 

 

4.2 BLOCK 2 

4.2.1 Flexural test  

4.2.1.1  Composites reinforced with pine fibres 

At 28 days the best MOR results, shown in  

Table 7, are achieved by PC samples (average of 11.35 MPa). These values are significantly 

higher compared to the samples made out of MgO-SiO2 cement (9.03 MPa). This difference may be 

attributed to the matrix performance and therefore explained because of the water to binder ratio 

for the different formulations. As it can be seen in Table 8, the water demand for the samples where 

MgO-SiO2 cement has been used (0.60) is higher than for samples using Portland cement (0.45). This 



86 
 

 

water/binder factor can generate an excess of water in the matrix, increasing the capillary pores, 

which is closely related to the decrease of the mechanical performance of cementitious materials ( 

CHEN; WU, 2013; KUMAR; BHATTACHARJEE, 2003; OZTURK; BARADAN, 2008). A data that confirms 

this fact is the bulk density of the materials at this age (Table 19), where the values for MgO-SiO2 

cement samples (1.39 g/cm3) are inferior to those for PC samples (1.54 g/cm3). At this same age, it 

can be seen that MOE is also clearly superior for Portland cement samples when compared to 

samples with MgO-SiO2 cement, presenting values of 7.59 and 3.26 GPa respectively. This fact also 

supports the idea that the higher flexural strength for samples with PC is correlated with its higher 

binder performance at 28 days, since MOE in cementitious materials is closely related to 

cementitious materials strength, considering the low modulus of vegetable fibres (ARDANUY; 

CLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015; MEHTA; MONTEIRO, 2006; NOGUCHI et al., 2009).

However the excess of water within the matrix, and hence a more porous matrix, can be 

responsible for a better interface between fibre and matrix, where pull-out is favourished instead 

of fibres collapse, promoting a higher deformation and absorbing more energy (SAVASTANO; 

WARDEN; COUTTS, 2005; TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000). Even with a lower MOR for MgO-SiO2 samples, 

SE thereof at 28 days (2.75 kJ/m2) is significantly outstanding when compared to PC samples (1.51 

kJ/m2), which means that this new type of cement presents a good compatibility with pine pulp to 



87 
 

 

resist flexural loads. The good flexural performance of the samples using MgO-SiO2 cement is still 

more pronounced with regard to the specific deflection at 50% of MOR, where these present a value 

of 0.05, more than twice than the value obtained for PC samples.

In contrast to what occurs at 28 days, the highest MOR values after 200 aac is exhibited by 

MgO-SiO2 samples (10.63 MPa). These samples experienced a statistical gain (from 9.03 MPa) that 

is accompanied also by another statistical MOE increase (from 3.26 to 4.92 MPa). All together 

indicates that the MOR improvement for MgO-SiO2 samples corresponds to the matrix modification 

and densification of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ). This is also based on the notable increase 

of the bulk density that is experienced (from 1.39 to 1.46 g·cm-1) by these samples (Table 19). The 

matrix modification of MgO-SiO2 samples may be responsible for the reduction of the specific 

deflection at 50% of MOR due to changes in the fibre-matrix interface. A less porous matrix may 

densify the vicinity of the fibre region. Therefore the adherence between fibre and matrix is 

improved and pull-out mechanism is hindered (SAVASTANO; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2005; TOLEDO 

FILHO et al., 2000). 

In the case of samples made out of PC the MOR suffers a drastic loss although MOE rises 

with a statistical significance, from 7.59 to 9.13 GPa. MOE and LOP are related to the matrix phase 

densification, which is favoured along hydration process that takes place after ageing cycles. 



88 
 

 

According to what was suggested previously, in this case the improvement of the matrix 

performance does not imply a better mechanical resistance of the whole composite. It is remarkable 

that, apart from suffering a drastic reduction of the MOR, specific energy and deflection, after 

ageing the samples made with PC have a slight increase of LOP, when compared to samples at 28 

days. Considering LOP as the first cracking point in the stress-deformation curve (ARDANUY; 

CLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015) and therefore the point where strain hardening begins, the 

limited growth of flexural stress after LOP may be considered as a decline of the reinforcing capacity 

of the fibres.

4.2.1.2 Composites reinforced with eucalyptus fibres 

For samples reinforced with eucalyptus pulps, identical trends to those observed for 

samples reinforced with pine pulp are found at both 28 days and after ageing treatment. Samples 

made out of PC present the highest MOR values at 28 days (11.24 MPa) but these values severely 

decrease after ageing (7.69 MPa) since bleached fibres are more susceptible to degradation. 

Samples with MgO-SiO2 cement, as happened for samples reinforced with pine pulp, initially present 

lower MOR values with higher SE at 28 days (9.23 MPa and 5.40 kJ/m2 respectively), although no 

statistical reduction of the SE occurs after ageing. This behaviour is exceptional since this 

conservation of the toughness after ageing is produced for the toughest formulation (5.07 kJ/m2 



89 
 

 

after ageing). This higher toughness observed for samples reinforced with eucalyptus may be linked 

to their morphological properties (TONOLI et al., 2010). As it can be seen in  

Figure 10, average length and width of eucalyptus fibres is considerably inferior to pine. 

Thus, for the same mass of reinforcing material, more reinforcing elements are dispersed within the 

matrix. This generates more reinforcing points to prevent cracking incidence (TONOLI et al., 2010). 

Also, from Figure 30, it is displayed a better dispersion of the eucalyptus fibres, avoiding the 

presence of unreinforced regions and, therefore, the propagation of major cracking before MOR is 

achieved.

Another disclosed aspect from flexural tests is the fibre preservation achieved by using low 

alkaline cement. It is reported that bleached pulps are more prone to chemical degradation due to 

their lower lignin content (MOHR; NANKO; KURTIS, 2005). Lignin acts as a barrier: being the first 

pulp component to suffer alkaline attack and consequently saving cellulose and hemicellulose 

initially from this deterioration. Such observation is noticeable by a drastic reduction of the SE (from 

4.97 to 0.14 kJ/m-2) for the samples of PC. Considering that the formulation where MgO-SiO2 cement 

and eucalyptus pulp are used present the higher SE and SD results, at 28 days and after ageing, it 

can be concluded that this type of material does not suffer a chemical degradation. In spite of the 



90 
 

 

reduction of the SE, this is not statistically meaningful, and the reduction of specific deflection may 

be linked to the modification of the fibre-matrix interface due to a matrix densification.   

 

4.2.2 Apparent porosity vs MOE 

From Figure 24 it is possible to appreciate a clear trend relating the decrease of apparent 

porosity with the increase of MOE. For every formulation, it is noted that samples experiment a 

decrease of the apparent porosity after ageing, accompanied by an enhancement of MOE. As 

previously mentioned this can be related to an improvement of the binder performance, since 

cement hydration continues after 28 days (ARDANUY; CLARAMUNT; TOLEDO FILHO, 2015; 

NOGUCHI et al., 2009). Thus, the matrix becomes less porous which improves the mechanical 

performance (MOE in this case) (CHEN; WU, 2013). The same situation can be proposed for the 

samples made out of MgO-SiO2  cement (ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014), as the 

hydration happens gradually, since the reaction of the SiO2 particles with Mg2+ ions takes place over 

time, because the hydration of MgO is needed to release ions and this process is not immediate 

(THOMAS; MUSSO; PRESTINI, 2014). The increase in matrix rigidity may modify the fibre-matrix 

interface, and this phenomenon can be attributed to the apparent porosity reduction. According to 

the graph, PC samples experience greater porosity reduction than MgO-SiO2 samples after ageing. 

This may be due to the larger amount of water retained within the MgO-SiO2  matrix after moulding 

(Table 8), which once the samples are set becomes void volume (CHEN; WU, 2013). This excess of 

water, added to the water absorbed by the vegetable fibres, generates an excess of voids that 

results into a less resistant material. The only case where water demand does neither imply a 

statistical difference in AP nor MOE is for PC samples at 28 days. However, the same trend observed 

for the rest of the samples is also noticed for PC after ageing.

4.2.3 SEM analysis 

From SEM analysis it is possible to see that in samples with Portland cement, vegetable 

fibres undergo mineralization after 200 aac. Figure 25 shows many eucalyptus fibres with the lumen 

filled with hydration products (encircled in white) after ageing. Also in Figure 25, there is a region 

(black square) that is zoomed for a better observation of this event. By EDS characterization it is 

inferred that there is a high concentration in Ca(OH)2 in the lumens of the eucalyptus fibres, since it 

is detected a high presence of Ca (green dots in Figure 26) and insignificant concentration of Si (blue 

dots). This situation may be explained by the bleached nature of the eucalyptus used in this study. 

While lignin is blocking the entrance of the ions in the lumen and pores of the pine fibre (Figure 26), 

the absence of lignin in the chemical composition of eucalyptus pulp may produce an increase of 

the fibres permeability, which also increases the ingress of Ca2+ and OH- ions that settle with time 

to produce Ca(OH)2 crystals, as proposed by Tonoli et al. (2012). Contrarily to what happens with 

samples with Portland cement and reinforced with eucalyptus fibres, when samples are reinforced 



92 
 

 

with pine pulp, the lumen of the fibres suffer much less mineralization, since unbleached pulp 

contain a higher percentage of lignin (Table 6) that helps with blocking the entrance of hydration 

products inside the lumen (Figure 27). For this type of reinforcement no trace of Ca(OH)2 penetrates 

into the inner regions of the fibres and rather stays surrounding the outer region of the fibres  

In the zoomed region (Figure 27), high portlandite concentration regions are found in the 

surroundings of the fibres. This may be justified, in contrast to what happens for bleached pulps, by 

pine pulps nature. The pine fibres used in these samples are unbleached and thereby the presence 

of lignin could act as a hydrophobic barrier for water not to accede to the interior of the fibres 

(TONOLI et al., 2012). However an adsorption phenomenon takes place and together with the water 

release of the fibres with time generates regions with high content in water in the vicinity of the 

reinforcing elements. This provokes the dissolution and precipitation of the Ca(OH)2 on the surface 

of the fibres, which may explain the decay of the mechanical performance after accelerated ageing 

(MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2009; WEI; MEYER, 2014). However 

it is possible to notice that the mineralization of the fibre, as in the case of eucalyptus fibre, is more 

destructive (based on loss of both MOR and SE) than the degradation provoked by portlandite in 

the external surface of the fibre (as in the case of Pine).

Regarding samples where MgO-SiO2 cement is used a different behaviour can be 

appreciated. In Figure 27, the surrounding area of a reinforcement fibre is displayed and it is possible 

to distinguish clearly the presence of Mg(OH)2 crystals at 28 days of age (encircled in white). 

Compared to samples after 200 aac, a remarkable difference is observable. It is possible to detect 

that the amount of Mg(OH)2 crystals after 200 acc is reduced. This may be a consequence of the 

evolution of the hydration reaction with time, where Mg(OH)2 particles react with anhydrous SiO2 

to form additional M-S-H gel. An effect of the continuity of the reaction over time is the densification 

of the matrix after ageing which would explain the reduction of the SE after ageing (Table 18) 

although no morphological evidence of degradation of the fibres can be observed. At 28 days, Figure 

28 shows noticeably regions where matrix and fibre are debonded (black arrows). After 200 cycles 

of accelerated ageing (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; SZCZERBA et al., 2013), fibre-matrix interface is 

modified and the gap between the cement matrix and the reinforcement is considerably reduced. 

Another outcome from matrix densification is the reduction of the water absorption and porosity 

of the samples for both types of reinforcement (Table 19).

Also in Figure 29 it is possible to see how matrix densening affects the fracture mechanism. 

From Figure 29a, where a surface of fracture is depicted from a MgO-SiO2 composite sample 

reinforced with pine pulp at 28 days, it is present an obvious space between hydration products and 

reinforcement element. However after accelerated ageing, Figure 29b, hydration products are 

totally attached to the surface of the fibre.

ageing cycles (d). Black arrows point to the fibre-matrix interface

This phenomenon is not important for samples reinforced with eucalyptus fibre (Figure 29c 

and Figure 29d). The reduction in the space between fibre and matrix is not as relevant as it is for 

samples reinforced with pine pulp, probably due to the lower water/cement associated to the lower 

water retention of the eucalyptus fibres. At 28 days, Figure 29c, the surface of fracture does not 

present a clear debonding of the fibre, generating energy dissipation by pull-out, showing no matrix 

damage. This behavior is also present after ageing, Figure 29d, in preserving fibre-matrix interface. 

From SEM analysis, another aspect that can be explained is the different reinforcement 

behavior related to the different types of pulp. According to Figure 10 it can be deduced that for the 

same mass of reinforcement, a greater amount of eucalyptus reinforcement elements is present 

when compared to pine fibres since eucalyptus pulp has shorter and thinner microfibres. This is in 



97 
 

 

accordance to Figure 30, where polished surfaces of samples reinforced with pine and eucalyptus. 

From these images it can be seen how the composite reinforced with eucalyptus pulp Figure 30b 

presents greater number of reinforcing elements than the corresponding ones reinforced with pine 

pulp, Figure 30a. This may explain the different SE presented for both types of reinforcement (Table 

18). Consequently, the higher number of reinforcing elements implies higher energy dissipation (at 

least in the initial ages).

4.3 BLOCK 3 

4.3.1 XRD analysis 

Carbonation curing effectiveness is confirmed by XRD tests. In Figure 31, it is shown for 

uncarbonated treatments, both non-aged (NC+NA) and aged (NC+A) that the main crystalline phase, 

apart from calcite (limestone), is brucite whose peaks are clearly detected at around 18, 38 and 58o 

2?. However, those brucite peaks for carbonated samples, non-aged (C+NA) and aged (C+A), present 

a lessened intensity while new crystalline phases corresponding to hydromagnesite are present [1–

6]. Although many of the characteristic peaks  corresponding to hydromagnesite XRD patterns are 

overlapped with either dolomite or calcite peaks (30.9, 35.8 and 43o 2?), there are other peaks in 

Figure 31 very characteristic from hydromagnesite only present in carbonated samples (at 13.7, 15, 



98 
 

 

20 and 26.5o 2??. It is expected that under the carbonation curing conditions (20% of CO2, 45oC and 

90% RH) hydromagnesite is formed following this reaction:  

5Mg(OH)2 +4CO2 ? Mg5(CO3)4(OH)24H2O (14) 

The lowering of the brucite peaks is even more significant for carbonated samples after 

accelerated ageing (C+A). Since the drying stage of the accelerated cycles is carried out at 60oC, this 

temperature promotes the formation of more hydromagnesite crystals over time once the process 

is started, even at atmospheric CO2 concentration.Another consequence is the partial carbonation 

of the M-S-H gels under higher CO2 concentration curing. According to several studies, in the 

intervals between 32-39o and 53-63o 2? a hump corresponding to M-S-H gels (LI et al., 2014; 

LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; WALLING et al., 2015) is expected. The presence 

of this hump is confirmed for non-carbonated samples (NC+NA and NC+A) (Figure 32). Nonetheless 

for carbonated samples (C+NA and C+A) the expected hump is plainly reduced in these regions 

confirming the reduction of the gel content.

gels are expected to appear. Dotted curves in black represent the gel bumps

4.3.2 TG and DTG analysis 

From TG curves displayed in Figure 33, the effect of carbonation curing is proved by an 

increased mass loss of the formulations with high CO2 concentration curing, both unaged and aged 

(C+NA and C+A) compared to the non-carbonated samples (NC+NA and NC+A). This augment in 

mass loss may be linked to the decomposition of the hydrated products formed during the curing at 

high CO2 concentration.  

Carbonated samples show similar DTG curves (Figure 34) to uncarbonated samples, 

presenting 4 well defined peaks for both treatments at around 105-135, 410-422, 450-459 and 777-

786oC. Those last two peaks, centred at around 455 and 780oC, correspond to polypropylene and 

limestone filler decomposition respectively. Polypropylene thermal disintegration is a single process 

that initiates at about 334oC and it ends at 493oC, achieving its maximum degree at 452oC, with a 

mass loss about 99.3 wt %, and an insignificant residual mass of 0.7 wt % (P?RP?RI?? et al., 2014). 

The almost complete disintegration of polypropylene justifies the presence of a peak in spite of its 

low weight in the formulation (2 wt %). Thermal decomposition of calcite single crystals, is produced 



100 
 

 

in the following reaction, CaCO3(s) ? CaO(s) + CO2(g), starting at T ~ 600°C and completed at around 

850°C; after losing 44 wt% matching to the stoichiometric CO2 amount in CaCO3 (RODRIGUEZ-

NAVARRO et al., 2009). Cellulose decomposition, main component of the unbleached pine pulp, is 

not well defined since it is decomposed at a single stage about 363oC (SHEN et al., 2013)  which is 

overlapped with a major peak. Cellulose also has a mass loss of 56 wt % and a reduced presence in 

the formulation (3 wt %) that makes difficult to quantify its disintegration from Figure 33. 

The effect of accelerated carbonation curing is clearly observed by differential 

thermogravimetry analysis. Comparing carbonated and uncarbonated samples DTG curves (Figure 

34) two clear new peaks appear for the carbonated samples at around 260 and 520oC, corresponding 

to decomposition of hydromagnesite (BOTHA; STRYDOM, 2001; HAURIE et al., 2007; HOLLINGBERY; 

HULL, 2010a, 2010b, 2012; VÁGVÖLGYI et al., 2008), which is the main product obtained as a 

consequence of the carbonation reactions. The temperature range in which hydromagnesite 

decomposition takes place varies from 220 and 550oC and it can be divided in three different stages, 

according to equations (15-17): (15) release of lattice water in the temperatures range of 220–

290oC, (16) dehydroxylation occurred in the range of 375–470oC and (17) decarbonation from 470 

to 550oC. Thus the observed peak at 260oC may be associated to the first stage while the peak 

observed at 520oC corresponds to the third step.  

4MgCO3 ·Mg(OH)2 · 4H2O ?  4MgCO3 ·Mg(OH)2 +4H2O (dehydration) (15) 

4MgCO3 ·Mg(OH)2 ?  4MgCO3 +MgO+H2O (dehydroxylation) (16) 

4MgCO3 ?  4MgO+4CO2 (decarbonation) (17) 

 

Apart from these new peaks, the displacement of the peaks at around 110 and 410oC for 

uncarbonated samples may be attributed to carbonation curing. The dislocation of the peak from 

410 to 425oC can be related to the transfer of part of the OH- groups from Mg(OH)2 to 

hydromagnesite, since main brucite dehydroxylation happens at around 400oC (WANG et al., 2014) 

while dehydroxylation for hydromagnesite occurs at around 430oC (BEALL et al., 2013; HAURIE et 

al., 2007). Regarding the peak centred at 110oC, attributable to the loss of loosely bound interlayer 

water in M-S-H gels (LI et al., 2014; LOTHENBACH et al., 2015; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; WALLING et 

al., 2015), it is possible to conclude that it has been displaced up to higher temperatures due to a 

partial carbonation of the gel induced by the high CO2 concentration. This phenomenon has also 

been reported for Portland cement pastes (ROSTAMI et al., 2012), where C-S-H phase is disarranged 



101 
 

 

by carbonates and C-S-H containing relatively high carbon content is detected by Energy Dispersive 

Spectroscopy (EDS). Though unusually present in nature, it is possible to find carbonate-altered 

serpentine rocks (listwanite), from a natural CO2 sequestration process through minerals 

carbonation (HANSEN et al., 2005). This process of carbonation of the serpentine crystals has been 

backed by experimental studies on a similar but simpler (MgO-SiO2-H2O-CO2) system (BJERGA; 

KONOPÁSEK; PEDERSEN, 2015; KLEIN; GARRIDO, 2011; KLEIN; MCCOLLOM, 2013). A possible 

explanation for this occurrence is the formation of a serpentine-carbonate crystal from M-S-H gel, 

analogue to talc-carbonates described in (BJERGA; KONOPÁSEK; PEDERSEN, 2015). 

On the other hand, no evidences of MgCO3 are confirmed by the thermogravimetry in this 

study. During magnesite decomposition a large endothermic peak centred at around 630–660oC 

occurs, yet it does not appear for none of the formulations studied (Figure 34). Only tiny traces of 

magnesite are noticed in this study and they come from the decarbonation of dolomite present in 

limestone filler.  

Comparing samples before and after accelerated ageing, no significant mass loss variations 

are identified by the thermogravimetry tests (Figure 33). Thus, hydration phases for both 

carbonated and uncarbonated samples are stable. This is especially relevant for carbonated 

products, given that after 100 accelerated ageing cycles the mass loss remains the same as 

immediately after curing.

4.3.3 SEM 

By means of SEM analysis, it is also possible to establish the effectiveness of the high CO2 

concentration curing. Figure 35 shows an image of a fractured surface of a non-carbonated sample 

after ageing, where it is possible to find the typical hydrated phases of the system MgO-SiO2-H2O: 

Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; SZCZERBA et al., 2013; ZHANG; 

CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). Particles of 

polypropylene and limestone are also present in Figure 35. M-S-H gels are clearly observed 

(encircled in white), showing a mesoporous (gel and capillary pores) poorly crystallized structure 

with a resemblance with Calcium Silicate Hydrate(C-S-H) gels produced during Portland cement 

hydration. 

However, carbonated samples after 100aac present additional structures unnoticed before 

carbonation curing (Figure 36). Apart from Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels, rosette shaped crystals are 

evident (encircled in yellow). In line with different authors (BEALL et al., 2013; CHEN et al., 2015; 

GAUTIER et al., 2014; LI et al., 2003; SUTRADHAR et al., 2011), this crystals morphology is in 

accordance to hydromagnesite shape which is described as rosette-like microstructure with 

crystalline walls interconnected to each other (Figure 36). Also, the hydromagnesite used by Chen 



103 
 

 

et al. (CHEN et al., 2015) for the synthesis of forsterite matches the exhibited dimensions to those 

presented by the crystals of hydromagnesite in Figure 36, with extremely thin sheets of around 20 

nm in thickness and less than 1 ?m inside length.

depicted in (b). MH, L and PP stand for Mg(OH)2, limestone and polypropylene respectively.  The white dashed lines 

show M-S-H gels. All images are for aged composites after accelerated aging test

From Figure 36, it is also possible to detect a more compacted amorphous structure (marked 

in white). This structure is visibly different from both hydromagnesite and bigger than the rest of 

hydrated magnesium silicate, typical from the reaction between MgO and amorphous SiO2 in water. 

Although the unavailability of micrographic information in the literature, the presence of two 

different amorphous phases is in line with XRD results, where part of the M-S-H gel disappear in 

carbonated samples giving origin to new compounds. The existence of these new particles may be 

interpreted as the result of the carbonation of M-S-H gels, supporting the hypothesis constructed 

from XRD results.

4.3.4 EDS analysis 

EDS is carried out in order to better identify the effects of the of carbonation curing on M-

S-H gels. Using this technique, the Mg/Si ratio of M-S-H gel areas is measured for both carbonated 

and non-carbonated samples in order to determine the chemical relation between Mg and Si of 

these compounds. In Figure 37 carbonated samples exhibit M-S-H gels with larger particles, such as 

Spectrum 2, compared to the rest of marked spectra. In Figure 37b, zoomed area from Figure 37a, 

the region around Spectrum 2 presents a clearly larger structure with a particle size between 1.5-

2.5??m, in contrast with the area around Spectrum 3, where smaller particles are observed (150-

300 nm). Heeding the Mg/Si atomic ratio of the different considered spectra (Table 20), the value 



105 
 

 

for Spectrum 2 is 1.41, which is close to the value of lizardite or antigorite [Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4], showing 

a higher magnesium concentration than the areas with presence of smaller particles of M-S-H gel 

(0.67-0.82).

analyzed spectra. In (a), white dashed lines encircle zoomed in (b). (b) represents a zoomed region of (a), where 

different types of M-S-H gels are shown 

 

Source: Own creation 

 

From Figure 38, where non-carbonated samples are displayed, a more homogenous matrix 

is observed, and for any region of the matrix the range of gel composition lies between Mg/Si atomic 

ratio 1.31-1.47. This value matches the value of the bigger particles in carbonated samples (Figure 

37). Therefore, it can be assumed that high CO2 environments affect M-S-H particles composition, 

reducing their Mg/Si atomic ratio and, hence, releasing Mg2+ ions that, in presence of free water, 

are susceptible of being carbonated into hydromagnesite. 



106

analyzed spectra

This decrease in Mg/Si ratio, from 1.31-1.47 to 0.67-0.82, involves an alteration in the 

chemical composition of the gels, changing from an arrangement like lizardite or antigorite to talc 

[Mg3Si4O10(OH)2] or sepiolite [Mg4Si6O15(OH)2·6H2O]. This composition similar to sepiolite may 

account for the increase in temperature of the endothermic peak observed in DTG analysis from 

110 to 135oC (Figure 34), since the loss of zeolitic and surface water of the sepiolite takes place up 

to 220oC, showing a peak centred about 125-135oC (BALCI, 1996; RUIZ et al., 1996; SHUALI, 1990). 

On the other hand, particles with lower Mg/Si values in Figure 37 show small structures, justifying 

the absence of large peaks in Figure 31, since the presence of sepiolite should result in an intense 

peak around 7.3o. The presence of small crystals also yields broader peaks in XRD. However, 

carbonated samples show a decrease of the intensity of the humps between 32-39o and 53-63o 2?, 

there is an increase in the bump from 15 to 40o 2?. This is in accordance to Cornejo and Hermosín 

(CORNEJO; HERMOSIN, 1988) , who generated a structural alteration of sepiolite by grinding. This 

crushing causes a destruction of the original tetrahedral-octahedral linkage of the sepiolite and 

generates an amorphous material, which produced a pronounced bump from 15 to 40o 2?. Besides, 

the alternation produced by grinding also increased the temperature of  the endothermic peak from 

105 to 135oC which is also confirmed in Figure 34.

4.3.5 Hydrated Magnesium Carbonates (HMC) thermodynamic stability 

In order to study thermodynamic stability of the HMC formed after carbonation curing, DTG 

curves are analysed before (C+NA) and after ageing (C+A), according to Figure 39. In this figure, the 

two major peaks present only in carbonated samples are zoomed. These peaks are related to the 

dehydration and decarbonation of hydromagnesite. Based on the endothermic peaks from 

differential scanning calorimetry, the DTG peaks between 160-340oC and 450-580oC can be 

deconvoluted into two minor Gaussian curves that match the different stages of both dehydration 

and decarbonation. The combinations of these Gaussian curves fitted the area of the obtained DTG 

and are used to determine the mass loss in each process. Nevertheless, the mass loss associated to 

hydromagnesite dehydroxylation, in the range of 375-470oC, is difficult to be established since the 

loss of (OH)- from hydromagnesite is overlapped with the mass loss of hydroxyl groups from 

Mg(OH)2 (at around 410oC for non-carbonated samples) partially present in the matrix. Besides 

polypropylene decomposition occurs between 334 and 493oC, which hinders the intensity 

quantification of the peak for each component in the range of 400 and 450oC.

where HMC dehydration and decarbonation occur 

 

Source: Own creation 

 

The quantification of the peak area for each decomposition stage is shown in Table 21. From 

these results no reduction is likely to take place for each peak after ageing. Although a tiny decrease 

in area is produced, from 3.14 to 3.05 (Table 21), in the dehydration peak for aged samples (C+A), 

the area obtained from HMC decarbonation for aged samples is higher than for non-carbonated 

samples, increasing from 4.68 to 5.04 (Table 21). Considering the total area corresponding to both 

decomposition processes, this value is also higher for aged samples which is in accordance with a 

reduction of Mg(OH)2 for carbonated samples after ageing (C+A), as proved by XRD (Figure 31). 

Considering that the ageing cycles used in this study simulates severe weather conditions, including 

intense temperature variations (from 20 to 60oC in 10 min), it is possible to affirm that no reverse 

reaction from carbonated to uncarbonated phase happens. Probably the reasonable explanation for 

this product stability is that the main HMC crystal found in this study keeps a major resemblance 

with hydromagnesite instead of nesquehonite, as stated by Unluer and Al-Tabbaa (UNLUER; AL-



109 
 

 

TABBAA, 2014) and after discussed elsewhere (UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2016; WALLING; PROVIS,

4.3.6 Mechanical and physical tests 

According to 4 points bending test results, carbonation has a plain influence on the 

mechanical properties. Although non-significant differences may be observed, both carbonated 

samples (unaged and aged) present higher MOR and lower SE values (Table 22). Concerning the 

matrix performance and, thus, the cement mechanical properties, the flexural parameters that offer 

the conclusive information are MOE and LOP (BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007). Regardless carbonation, 

both formulations suffer a statistical significant reduction of MOE after ageing: approximately 25% 

and 38% for carbonated and uncarbonated respectively. This loss of rigidity may be associated to 

the conversion of Mg(OH)2, that is the result of the expansive reaction from MgO and H2O, into 

other hydrated phases: M-S-H gels for uncarbonated samples (JIN; AL-TABBAA, 2014; LI et al., 2014; 

SZCZERBA et al., 2013; ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; VANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; 

CHEESEMAN, 2014) and magnesium carbonates for carbonated samples (BOTHA; STRYDOM, 2001, 

2003; FERNÁNDEZ et al., 1999; NDUAGU et al., 2012; UNLUER; AL-TABBAA, 2014). In spite of the 

reduction of the stiffness in carbonated samples after ageing, carbonation has a positive effect on 

the matrix since LOP increases at the same age. The end of the elastic region (LOP) in fibre-cement 

composites is considered as the maximum load that is resisted mainly by the cementitious matrix 



110 
 

 

(BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007). Consequently, an increase in LOP can be related to an improvement of 

the mechanical strength of the matrix. In view of the results, carbonation of the MgO-SiO2 systems 

in composites with vegetable fibres enhances the mechanical performance of the cement. 

Compared to previous works where carbonation of Portland cement is used to improve and 

preserve the mechanical properties of cementitious products reinforced with vegetable fibre 

(ALMEIDA et al., 2013), MOR results obtained in this study are lower. These differences in MOR 

values may be due to lower short fibres content (3% in this study compared with 10% used by 

(ALMEIDA et al., 2013) which generates a different number of reinforcing elements. However, the 

values reported by Almeida et al. showed lower values of specific energy compared with those 

obtained in this work, which can be attributed to the content of long fibres, polypropylene, allowing 

greater energy dissipation by pull-out. In this study, the energy absorbed during bending test is 

conserved without loss of deformation and resistance. These results are consistent with those 

obtained by Khorami et al (KHORAMI; GANJIAN; SRIVASTAV, 2016) where samples reinforced with 

PP fibres experienced a large deformation due to the large tensile deformation of these fibres. 

However according to Khorami et al, PP fibres did not provide a satisfactory performance as 

reinforcing elements, since in spite of improving ductility and toughness, flexural strength declined. 

In another work where PP fibres and pulp pine are used as reinforcement elements of fibre-

cement (BEZERRA; JOAQUIM; SAVASTANO JR, 2004), mechanical results are lower than those 

obtained in this experiment, for both MOR and SE. This indicates the efficiency of the matrix used 

in this study and the viability to use PP as reinforcement fibres, which generally provide ineffective 

mechanical performance. 

The parameter that decreases in a significant manner for both carbonated formulations is 

SD. This phenomenon is commonly associated to the modification of the interfacial transition zone 

(ITZ) between matrix and fibre. Though carbonation has been reported to have a positive filling 

effect and  to reduce porosity in cement composites, it also densifies the ITZ (PIZZOL et al., 2014; 

SANTOS et al., 2015a). This fact is also reinforced by the significant reduction of the apparent 

porosity after carbonation (Table 24), achieving a decline of the porosity of up to 38%, and 

simultaneously increasing the bulk density of the whole composite. The densification of the ITZ is 

one of the causes of the fracture mechanism modification in fibre-reinforced cementitious products 

(TOLEDO FILHO et al., 2000; SAVASTANO; WARDEN; COUTTS, 2005), where less-dense interfaces are 



111 
 

 

prone to pull-out and thus energy absorption, while denser transition zones trend to higher fibre-

matrix adherence, promoting the fibre collapse.  

Another possible explanation for the reduction of SD is the first tension that fibre 

reinforcements begin to resist. Considering the statistical higher LOP values for carbonated samples, 

reinforcement elements within these formulations are initially loaded at superior levels than in the 

case of non-carbonated samples at the first cracking episode. Thus, the fact of beginning to resist 

higher tension values makes those fibres in carbonated samples do not elongate as much as fibres 

in non-carbonated samples. However, this ductility lessening does not affect the toughness of the 

carbonated samples since there is no significant difference between carbonated samples and 

uncarbonated samples for both aged and unaged samples.

According to physical tests, carbonation presents evident advantages for fibre-cement 

products (Table 24). The first benefit is the decrease of apparent porosity, which is especially 

important for fibre-cement elements reinforced with cellulosic fibres since products with less 

apparent pores are more effective against any chemical or biological attack (BENTUR; MINDESS, 

2007). Another advantage is the decline of water absorption. This aspect is particularly useful for 

the main current application of fibre-cement products: roofing elements. Low water absorbent 

products are more resistant against freeze-thaw cycles (BENTUR; MINDESS, 2007) and water 

permeability, improving durability of building materials under direct exposure to the natural 

weather. Besides in this study by the application of accelerated ageing (100 soak-dry cycles), 

extremely aggressive environmental conditions are simulated, combining stages of high 

temperature (60oC) and low humidity (ventilated oven) with immersion (rainy) periods.  The effect 

of carbonation of MgO-SiO2 systems supposes an improvement that allows obtaining values of AP, 

BD WA and similar to those obtained with Portland cement composites (BEZERRA; JOAQUIM; 

SAVASTANO JR, 2004).

4.4.1 Paste tests 

4.4.1.1 Hydration of the  pastes and dynamic MOE results 

From Figure 40, it is possible to observe how samples containing sepiolite increase MOE 

mean values regardless the amount and type of sepiolite. Comparing different types of sepiolite, 

samples with CIMSIL sepiolite present higher elastic modulus than samples with PANGEL. For both 

types of sepiolite samples the higher content in sepiolite the higher MOE values. PC samples have 

higher mean MOE values than MgO-SiO2 samples but 2% CIMSIL is the treatment that presents 

higher values from day 5.

Regarding the hydration degree by comparing TG and DTG curves and XRD spectra (Figure 

41 and Figure 42), samples containing CIMSIL sepiolite does not modify significantly the amount of 

hydrated phases compared to samples without sepiolite, though little reduction of unreacted MgO 

and MH is perceived and M-S-H gel content slightly increases. Although, the mechanical 

improvement of the pastes, the little chemical effect of CIMSIL sepiolite on the paste hydration 

confirms its inactivity as pozzolanic material (HE; MAKOVICKY; OSBÆCK, 1996). 

Samples containing PANGEL sepiolite, however, clearly decreases the amount of unreacted 

MgO and MH with a well-defined increase in the M-S-H gel content. This is especially remarkable 

for 1% PANGEL samples, which does not show any trace of unreacted MgO in its spectrum and 

shows little peaks corresponding to MH, displaying an almost identic XRD spectra pattern and TG 

curve of M-S-H synthetized gel (BREW; GLASSER, 2005; LI et al., 2014; ZHANG; CHEESEMAN; 

VANDEPERRE, 2011; ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014). This may be explained because of 

the greater water demand either of PANGEL samples or due to the lower anionic charge. According 

to (ZHANG; VANDEPERRE; CHEESEMAN, 2014), where  magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) cement 



115 
 

 

pastes are obtained using sodium hexametaphosphate as deflocculant, samples with higher w/c 

ratio are expected to show a greater hydration degree at the same age. In this case, since its large 

specific surface, finer sepiolite provides wet condition that favors the magnesia-silica reaction, as 

happens with pozzolanic reaction (ANDREJKOVICÔVÁ, 2011). 

Also, the higher zeta-potential of CIMSIL has an electrostatic stabilizing effect upon the 

cement paste, thus reducing the hydration rate of these samples (NÄGELE; SCHNEIDER, 1989). Given 

the greater specific surface of PANGEL sepiolite (Table 10), this could act as a stronger nucleation 

seeding effect resulting in a faster hydration as it can be seen in Figure 43c, where needle-shaped 

particles of PANGEL sepiolite are tightly adhered on the surface of well-packed particles of M-S-H 

gels. This is also supported by (KAVAS; SABAH; ÇELIK, 2004) that reported the capability of sepiolite 

to absorb more alkaline compounds since its higher surface area. However, in the case of CIMSIL 

samples (Figure 43b), sepiolite microfibres are linking loose M-S-H particles which suggests a prior 

gel growth and later physical attachment with the fibres.

These acerose particles match perfectly the size of sepiolite, 1-2 ?m length and 0.2 ?m width. It is 

also shown that hydrated products cover acicular particles. Figure 43c, referring to pastes where 1% 

PANGEL sepiolite is used, shows different sides of a fractured surface packed with M-S-H particles

PANGEL sepiolite, where M-S-H gel particles are interconnected with a 3D net created by sepiolite 

particles. Part of these sepiolite needles are covered by hydrated products while some others are 

not. This area with high concentration of sepiolite is openly porous in contrast with areas with more 

M-S-H particles.

4.4.2 Composite tests 

4.4.2.1 Flocculation tests 

In Figure 44a, the chord size evolution of MgO-SiO2 powder suspension is exhibited, 

revealing a mean size of 38 ?m before flocculant addition and 109 ?m after flocculant addition, 

which is the maximum mean chord size. Adding CaCO3 to MgO-SiO2 mixture slightly decreases the 

chord size before flocculant addition, and does not affect the chord size after flocculant addition 

and decreases floc stability, reducing chord size at deflocculation stage beginning (840 s). When 

undelaminated sepiolite is added to MgO-SiO2 suspension (Figure 44b), chord size at every stage for 

every mix design slightly decreases, being further reduced for CIMSIL samples and 2% sepiolite 

content samples.

 The addition of delaminated sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 powder (Figure 44c) increases the chord 

size at the flocculation stage for 1% sepiolite gel content samples, while it is reduced for 2% sepiolite 

gel content samples. Shorter chord size is obtained when PANGEL sepiolite is used. When PC 

suspension is analyzed (Figure 44d), a mean chord size of 22 ?m before flocculant addition and 108 

?m after flocculant addition (max. chord size) is shown. Adding CaCO3 to PC powder slightly 

decreases the chord size before flocculant addition (to 18 ?m) and at every stage. In contrast to 

MgO-SiO2 samples, undelaminated sepiolite in PC suspension (Figure 44e) does not significantly 

affect the chord size at any stage. However, when sepiolite is delaminated (Figure 44f), PC 

suspensions chord size is strongly increased at flocculation stage, boosted immediately after 

flocculant addition. More chord floc stability is achieved for 1% sepiolite gel content samples, 

keeping longer chord size even at the beginning of the deflocculation stage. Only 1% sepiolite gel 

content samples, both CIMSIL and PANGEL, retain higher chord size during deflocculation and keep 

it as high as control samples during reflocculation stages.  

 The addition of undelaminated sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 powder dispersed in a pine pulp 

suspension is displayed in Figure 45a. Undelaminated sepiolite does not significantly affects the 

chord size after flocculant addition, however somewhat increases floc stability, yielding rather 

longer flocs after both deflocculation and reflocculation. Further chord size increase is achieved by 

CIMSIL samples. Contrarily to undelaminated sepiolite, delaminated sepiolite (Figure 45b) intensely 

rises chord size at every stage ans shows similar performance for every formulation regardless 

sepiolite type and content. It also causes a reflocculation event during flocculation stage, after a 

faster floc size reduction and slight floc size regrowth. Considering the addition of undelaminated 

sepiolite to PC powder dispersed in a pine pulp suspension (Figure 45c), no significant effect is 

observed after flocculant addition, still slightly increases floc stability, yielding rather longer flocs 

during reflocculation. Little further chord size increase is displayed by CIMSIL samples and 2% 

sepiolite content samples. In the case of delaminated sepiolite in PC powder dispersed in a pine pulp 

suspension (d), chord size at every stage is intensely raised, regardless sepiolite type and content. 

As happened with MgO-SiO2 suspension, a reflocculation event during flocculation stage, after a 

faster floc size reduction and slight floc size regrowth takes place.

Figure 46- Drainage curves displayed by the different fibre–cement slurries: (a) using MgO-SiO2 powder and (b) using 
Ordinary Portland cement (PC) 

 

Source: Own creation 

 

Drainage curves for suspensions with both types of binder systems (Figure 46) display 

similar trend, with an initial rapid drainage where most of the water is drained, a transition zone 

from fast to low drainage and residual drainage, where horizontal asymptote is shown, keeping 

stable the drained water values over time. Comparing drainage curves of MgO-SiO2 (a) and PC (b) 

suspensions, MgO-SiO2 samples drain less water (ranging from 41-54%) compared to PC samples 

(55-60.5%), so MgO-SiO2 matrices retain more water for every formulation. When flocculant to the 

suspensions, the amount of final drained water for both types of suspension is reduced, from 60.5 

to 59.75 % for PC samples and from 54 to 47g for MgO-SiO2 samples. However, it increases the 

drainage speed, rising the percentage of drained water after 10s from 79 to 85% for PC samples and 

from 71 to 78% for MgO-SiO2 samples.  

Considering the addition of delaminated sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 mixture dispersed in a pine 

pulp suspension (Figure 46a) it is observed that it decreases the amount of drained water from the 

samples but for samples with 1% CIMSIL. The amount of drained water is mainly reduced by samples 

containing PANGEL sepiolite, where the greatest reduction is shown by 2% PANGEL sepiolite 

content. However, it increases the drainage speed, rising the amount of drained water after 10 s for 

every sample. When delaminated sepiolite is added to PC suspensions (Figure 46b), the amount of 



122 
 

 

drained water for every sample is reduced. Further drainage reduction is shown by 2% sepiolite 

content samples. Sepiolite in PC suspensions also reduces the drainage speed, dropping the amount 

of drained water after 10 s for every sample. 1% sepiolite content samples have similar drainage 

values (230 g aprox. after 100 s) and drainage speed after 10 s (35% aprox.). 2% PANGEL sepiolite 

content samples present faster drainage (65% after 10 s) compared to the rest of the samples with 

sepiolite addition, although the total amount of water (220 g after 100 s) is similar of the 2% CIMSIL 

sepiolite content samples, which have the slowest drainage at 10 s (29%). 

 

4.4.2.3 Flexural tests 

According to flexural tests, when MgO-SiO2 cement is replaced in 1% by mass of CIMSIL 

sepiolite, all the mechanical parameters are increased except MOE. The rest of the replacements do 

not improve any parameter. The addition of sepiolite reduces the coefficient of variation for every 

studied parameter in most of the studied compositions. This is closely related to a more 

homogeneous composite. The only composition that is not in accordance with this trend is the one 

with 1% of PANGEL sepiolite. The properties related to the binder matrix rigidity (LOP and MOE) are 

more variable for this composition. The addition of PANGEL sepiolite yields lower flexural 

performance than CIMSIL sepiolite. Even at 2% by mass replacement, CIMSIL samples offer higher 

flexural properties compared to PANGEL samples.

Considering the water retention after drainage (Figure 46), samples with 1% of CIMSIL 

sepiolite does not affect the drainage capacity of the composite compared to samples with no 

sepiolite in the composition. Since hydraulic compaction is alike for every sample, for 1% CIMSIL 

samples, water to cement ratio stays at the same level and simultaneously present more reinforcing 

elements within the matrix. However, samples with 2% of CIMSIL sepiolite retain more water after 

drainage which leads to a higher w/c ratio and therefore to lower composite properties. This greater 

water retention is also reproduced by PANGEL samples, with both 1 and 2% replacement, which 

promotes lower performance composites.  

Regarding the flocculation of the samples (Figure 45), samples with 2% of PANGEL sepiolite 

present a superior chord size than 1% PANGEL samples. Bigger flocs are related to better connected 

fibre nets so samples with larger flocs also offer better properties related to the binder rigidity. This 

factor explains the superior flexural performance of samples with 2% of PANGEL despite of having 



124 
 

 

a higher w/c ratio than 1% PANGEL samples. Besides, the larger floc size may be linked to the greater 

bending capacity of the 1% CIMSIL samples compared to the MgO-SiO2 samples with no sepiolite 

added.

From Figure 47 and Table 25, MgO-SiO2 samples with no addition of sepiolite (0%) have 

similar MOR as PC samples and also present similar characteristics related to the matrix 

performance (MOE and LOP). Nevertheless, properties related to the efficiency of the reinforcing 

elements are slightly lower for MgO-SiO2 samples. This may be attributed to a worse fibre-matrix 

interface, since water retention is higher for MgO-SiO2 samples which promotes more porous areas 

in the interface transition zone (ITZ). A clear example of porous ITZ is exhibited with the addition of 

sepiolite to the MgO-SiO2 binding systems, excluding 1% CIMSIL samples. Samples with sepiolite 

show similar trend to PC and 0% samples at the initial stages of the flexural test. In the beginning, 

when stresses are mainly resisted by the matrix, all samples behave in an identical manner, yet when 

loads exceed LOP and are transferred to the fibres, samples with sepiolite reach earlier their MOR 

and are quickly deflected at lower flexural stresses. Considering that the main difference between 

the samples is the retained water, this lack of toughness shown by sepiolite formulated samples in 



125 
 

 

the plastic zone of the curve may be attributed to an extra porosity in the ITZ that disturbs the 

proper transmission of loads from matrix to fibres. 

4.4.2.4 Composite images 

In Figure 48, where fibres are centered in the middle of SEM images taken from every 

sample with sepiolite replacement, it is observed how the reinforcing fibre in 1% CIMSIL samples (a) 

presents failures, even exposing the lumen, in contrast to what happens with the rest of the samples 

(b, c and d), that show an intact fibre. The rest of the samples also show higher emptiness between 

matrix and fibre, as a consequence of the larger porosity of these samples. Imperfections in the fibre 

observed in 1% CIMSIL sample (a) comes from necking episodes in the fibre after larger deflections. 

For this reason, effects on the fibre related to necking events generate higher SE performance of 

the composite, since the fibre requires more energy to be pulled out from the matrix.

4.4.2.5 Physical tests 

Physical tests performed on samples after flexural tests (Table 26), results confirm the 

trends observed with mechanical results, indicating that PC samples are denser and less porous due 

to the lower water retention values compared to MgO-SiO2 samples. Greater porosity is observed 

in samples with lower mechanical performance, which is consistent with a more porous ITZ.

4.5.1 TG and DTG analysis 

In order to study natural fibres degradation, the same way it is commonly performed when 

applied in polymer composites during the processing at elevated temperatures, the thermal 

behaviour of cellulosic fibres is conventionally assessed. Thus, TGA was carried out to analyse the 

thermal decomposition of sisal fibres after different ageing conditions. In Figure 49, TG and DTG 

curves of sisal are displayed and it is possible to observe different decomposition behaviours 

according to the different ageing situations.

Raw sisal fibres DTG curve reveals two major peaks and a minor one at around 75oC, 

resulting from the loss of absorbed water in the fibre (intra and intermolecular dehydration 

reactions) (FAIRBRIDGE; ROSS; SOOD, 1978). From the major peaks, the first one is attributed to 

hemicellulose and cellulose degradation (between 200 to 400oC). The second peak is related to the 

decomposition of the char (between 425 and 530oC) produced during the pyrolysis of the previous 

components in an oxidative environment (FAIRBRIDGE; ROSS; SOOD, 1978; MARTIN et al., 2010). 

Sisal fibre degradation approximately started at around 195oC and took place rapidly with the 

temperature increase until 385oC. In the range of 320-345oC a maximum value of the DTG is 

observed (Figure 49), attributable to the decomposition of cellulose (Figure 52). In addition, during 

this degradation process, DTG curve displays a shoulder at around 295oC due to the hemicellulose 

degradation. This shoulder suggests that two different thermal decomposition steps are overlapped. 

Regarding lignin degradation, it is not possible to infer any conclusion since lignin content in sisal 

fibres is reduced compared with holocellulose content and this process of degradation takes place 

evenly from 180 to 344oC. Also lignin DTG maximum peak is produced at 205oC according to 



128 
 

 

(BENÍTEZ-GUERRERO et al., 2014), which is overlapped in between the maximum of both 

hemicellulose (286.8oC) and cellulose (325.4oC) as seen in Figure 52. 

Exposing sisal fibre to MgO-SiO2 cement for 5 months changes the thermal decomposition 

of the fibres.  The intensity of the DTG maximum peak is increased, which is related to cellulose 

fraction increase. Along with that, the shoulder at about 295oC vanishes. This behaviour is similar to 

sisal fibres when are treated with NaOH solution (ZHOU; CHENG; JIANG, 2014). In this alkali 

environment, pectin and hemicellulose are reduced. 

However, in fibres submitted to PC environment all the peaks decrease their intensity and 

shoulder remains. This reduction in the hemicellulose and cellulose decomposition is associated to 

their content reduction, as consequence of alkaline hydrolysis of amorphous holocellulose and lignin 

(WEI; MEYER, 2014). Also, considering Figure 50, where both PC and MgO-SiO2 samples are analysed 

by thermogravimetry, PC samples after 5 months show a peak between 520-760oC, which matches 

the DTG peak shown by fibres after 5 months in PC curve around that temperature. This peak in 

Portland cement, at 520-760oC, is due to the CO2 released during calcium carbonate decomposition 

(DWECK et al., 2000). However, CaCO3 is not a direct product from cement hydration reactions and 

comes instead from the reaction between Ca(OH)2 and environmental CO2 (ARANDIGOYEN; 

ÁLVAREZ, 2006). Moreover, since CaCO3 has less solubility than Ca(OH)2, the presence of CaCO3 in 

the fibres is explained by the mineralization in the lumen of the fibre from the Ca2+ ions absorbed 

by the fibres in an aqueous suspension. The mineralization of the fibres is even more developed 

after 400 accelerating ageing cycles exposure, since fibres exposed in PC present a bigger CaCO3 

peak. This process in sisal fibres in PC environments is avoided by using MgO-SIO2 instead, where 

no traces of hardened pasted is registered in the fibres.

In Figure 51 and Figure 52 it is displayed a higher mass loss reduction of the lignocellulosic 

components after 400 accelerated ageing cycles compared to samples after 5 months exposure for 

both treatments. Exposing fibres to MgO-SIO2 environment reduces hemicellulose content while 

cellulose remains at higher concentration than unaged sisal fibres. However, PC exposure initially (5 

months ageing) affects amorphous cellulose and after 400 accelerated ageing cycles both 

hemicellulose and cellulose are further reduced.

According to activation energy (Figure 53) results obtained from thermogravimetric 

analysis, it is possible to observe a relationship between fibre composition and the energy required 

to decompose the fibre. Even though holocellulose is considered a two-step decomposition process, 

hemicellulose first and then cellulose, activation energy is strongly influenced by the cellulose 

content rather than by the holocellulose. Figure 53 displays how the higher cellulose content 

samples present the higher activation energy for aged samples. Thus, samples aged in MgO-SiO2 



131 
 

 

cement keep high activation energy even after 400aac since cellulose content is increased and most 

of the amorphous components are removed. Contrary to this, when fibres are exposed to PC, they 

present the lower activation energy. However, this difference in activation energy is not enough to 

explain the decay of the mechanical performance of the fibres after ageing  previously reported 

when cellulosic pulps were applied in fibre-cement composites in Block 2 or (MÁRMOL; 

SAVASTANO, 2017).

4.5.2 XRD analysis 

X-ray spectrograms in Figure 54 display the effect of the different cement environment 

exposure on the sisal fibres crystallography. XRD patterns of untreated and aged fibres after 5 

months and 400 accelerated ageing cycles for both Portland and MgO-SIiO2 cement are shown. In 

every sample, three bumps are marked with full black circles at around 14.8, 16.4 and 22.6 o, 

matching the (110), (1-10) and (200) diffraction planes of cellulose I? polymorphism respectively 

(BARRETO et al., 2011). Contrary to what happens in crystalline cellulose samples, as hemp fibres 



132 
 

 

(OUAJAI; SHANKS, 2005), sisal fibres spectra show one broad peak that unifies the two diffraction 

peaks around 14.8 o and 16.4 o. The spectra are alike for most of the samples but the samples covered 

with Portland cement for 400 accelerated ageing cycles. The rest of the samples embedded in 

cement show higher peaks. This increase in intensity proves that amorphous phases of the fibres 

were removed and cellulose remains in higher concentration. Only fibres in Portland cement after 

accelerated ageing present a reduced cellulose concentration. Also higher holocellulose 

degradation is registered by thermogravimetric techniques.

Regarding cellulose crystallinity (¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de la referencia.), Ic was i

ncreased for every sample surrendered by alkaline matrices. When sisal fibres are exposed to 

alkaline atmospheres, crystalline cellulose fraction increases since amorphous cellulose is also 

eliminated (FERNANDES; MANO; REIS, 2013). Even after 400 accelerated ageing cycles in Portland 

cement, crystallinity is higher than unaged fibres, which suggests that cellulose crystallinity after 

ageing is preserved. However in PC samples, after 400 cycles, cellulose crystallinity is lower than 

samples after 5 months of ageing, indicating a decay of crystallinity over time. This increase in 



133 
 

 

cellulose crystallinity for samples aged in MgO-SIO2 cement is considered to be beneficial for sisal 

fibres, since it ensures high strength and durability of fibres in cementitious materials (WEI; MEYER, 

2014).

According to Figure 54, every sample increases crystallite size values. This is in contrast to 

what is reported to happen when cellulosic fibres are submitted to high alkaline solutions, where 

crystallite size is reduced (LING et al., 2017). Although crystallite size increase is not elevated, it is 

enough to assure that no decrease takes place. One of the mechanisms of degradation of sisal fibres 

proposed when used in cementitious materials is the alkaline hydrolysis (MELO FILHO; SILVA; 

TOLEDO FILHO, 2013) ,which yields breakdown of cellulose chains, so a reduction of crystallite size 

occurs. Based on TG and DTG results, when sisal fibres are aged in Portland cement, there is a 

reduction of cellulose content in the samples that is related to cellulose hydrolysis (BALLESTEROS et 

al., 2017). However, this reduction in cellulose fraction is not related to a reduction of the crystallite 

size, showing that crystallinity of cellulose is not affected after ageing. On the other hand, this 

increment in crystallite size may be explained by the swelling reaction between alkalis and cellulose 

fibres, during which a relaxation of the cellulose crystalline structure occurs. Another reason for this 

crystallite size increment is the immobilization of alkalis due to their mineralization and deposition 

on the fibre surface after reacting with the rest of fibre components such as hemicellulose and lignin. 

 

According to different authors (MELO FILHO; SILVA; TOLEDO FILHO, 2013; MOHR; 

BIERNACKI; KURTIS, 2006), another factor for cellulose degradation that is also confirmed by XRD is 

the crystallization of lime in the fibres. For samples embedded in Portland cement, a different peak 

is noticeable on the diffractogram after 5 months of ageing and plainly recognizable after 400 



134 
 

 

accelerated ageing cycles at around 29.5o, as well as minor peaks 36.1 and 39.6o. These peaks 

present only in sisal fibres when aged in Portland cement match calcite diffractogram (CaCO3) 

formed by the carbonation of Ca(OH)2. In addition, another calcite peak is overlapped with (2 0 0) 

cellulose diffraction plane at around (29.5). CaCO3 sharpens this peak and, therefore, reduces its 

FWHM, so crystallite size is increased even after accelerated ageing. However, samples aged in 

MgO-SiO2 cement do not present any extra peaks from those original present in unaged sisal fibres. 

Consequently, mineralization process is avoided by using this new type of cement.

Figure 55 displays DSC trends of sisal as received and aged in both MgO-SiO2 and PC. 

Temperature scale is set in the 200-400oC range since previous to 200oC only dehydration process 

takes place from moisture, according to (CHAND et al., 1987), and energy involved is also related to 

cement decomposition process.  For every sample, there is a well-defined exothermic peak from 



135 
 

 

cellulose degradation process. Dehydration of holocellulose molecules at lower temperatures 

(CHAND et al., 1987) is followed by splitting of hydroxyl groups in oxidative atmosphere 

(SHAFIZADEH; BRADBURY, 1979). From 400oC onwards, char from oxidation is produced. Unaged 

sisal peak is centred at around 327oC (Figure 55). When ageing in MgO-SiO2 is applied, exothermic 

peak is slightly increased to higher temperatures, to 330 and 335oC after 400 aac and 5 months 

respectively (Figure 55). Since hemicellulose and lignin degradation starts before cellulose (YANG et 

al., 2007; ZHOU; CHENG; JIANG, 2014), increasing temperatures of the peak centre indicates a higher 

cellulose content.  

When sisal fibres are aged in PC for 5 months, energy intensity as well as peak centre 

temperature are decreased. This indicates that the lower the cellulose content, the lower the 

enthalpy energy. However, after accelerated ageing (400 cycles), both peak intensity and 

temperature at the centre are increased (Figure 55). Thus, cellulose fraction is recovered since 

amorphous materials are removed and crystallinity is preserved, as previously stated from TG, DTG 

and DRX results.  

 

4.5.4 SEM and EDS analysis 

Samples exposed to MgO-SiO2 for 5 months, shown in Figure 56a, present a well preserved 

structure compared to unaged sisal fibres (Figure 56d). Neither cell walls nor lamella are damaged 

in contrast to fibres embedded in PC for 5months (Figure 56b), where cracks start from the lumen 

and are spread outwards though the cell walls. This breakage of cell tissues (cellulose mainly) after 

5 months in PC is in accordance to TG results where a decrease of cellulose is reported and it is 

clearly related to lower activation energy. Besides, samples in PC at this same age (Figure 56c and f) 

reveal that lignin and hemicellulose microfibrils suffer a breakage so a debonding process between 

microfibres is initiated.

137 
 

 

Although in PC after 5 months of ageing fibres preserve their integrity and no deposits of 

hydrated phases of cement are present on the surface (Figure 56a and b), after 400 ageing cycles 

fibres are disaggregated (Figure 56e). This disaggregation goes along with by the precipitation of 

compounds from the cement matrix between the microfibres (Figure 57c). By EDS mapping (Figure 

57d) it is inferred that those compounds are Ca rich so this precipitation, matches perfectly with the 

XRD results, where CaCO3 is identified. EDS results also reveal another important detail since Ca rich 

zones match C poor zones which can be related with the presence of other compounds with no C. 

These compounds, also reported by other authors as portlandite [Ca(OH)2], undergo a carbonation 

process to form CaCO3. Fibre fragilization is attributed to these Ca compounds, so mechanical 

performance thereof is severely decrease. The embrittlement of the fibres due to the presence of 

Ca-based combinations is responsible for the lack of long term reinforcing capacity of sisal fibres in 

cementitious components.  

In the case of samples aged for 400 accelerated ageing cycles in MgO-SiO2 cement (Figure 

58c and d) no sign of disaggregation is observed and no compounds are precipitated between the 

microfibres, which may be related to a preservation of the mechanical properties of the fibres and, 

therefore, a maintenance of their reinforcing capacity. Despite no presenting any traces of hydrated 

phases bonded to surface at 5 months (Figure 58a and b), in samples after 400 aac by EDS mapping 

it is displayed the presence of Mg particles bonded to the surface of the fibres. This may be explained 

by the evolution of the hydration reaction of the cement over time, that generates more hydrated 

compounds after 400aac (MÁRMOL et al., 2016). However, it is important to notice that these 

compounds are also rich in Si, which suggest the presence of M-S-H gel particles surrounding the 

fibres. This is of relevance, since it proves a good adherence between M-S-H gel, that are the main 

responsible for the good mechanical performance of MgO-SiO2 cement, and lignocellulosic fibres, 

with no signs of degradation even after 400 accelerated ageing.

5 CONCLUSIONS 

5.1 General Conclusions 

As intended initially, production of FRCC with MgO based cement and lignocellulosic fibres 

was succesfully achieved. Clinker-free cement, made out of a blend of MgO (60% w.t.) and SiO2 (40% 

w.t.) powder was used as hydraulic binder matrix for FRCC. This cement presents higher 

compressive stregth compared to Portland cement for a 0.5 water to binder ratio after 28 days of 

curing under saturated environment conditions. It also has lower pH values from the first hydration 

stages (pH=11.09 after mixing in water) and it decreases over time (pH=9.91 after 28 days). Thin 

sheets of FRCC with the new cement were bending tested and good mechanical properties were 

achieved and well preserved after ageing. Contrary to what happens in samples made out of 

Portland cement, with MgO based cement samples, no degradation mechanisms are noticed after 

ageing. Specific energy does not decreases and bending strength is improved along with time due 

to the ongoing hydration of the MgO-SiO2-H20 systems. Also carbonation curing has been proved to 

improve FRCC stability. New Hydrate Magnesium Carbonated phase is obtained, which yields to 

more rigid materials due to the higher volume of hydrates in the matrix. Partial cement replacement 

by sepiolite improves flocculation estability of the fibre-cement suspensions, particles retention and 

FRCC homogeneity since the variation coeficient of the mechanical parametres and physiclal 

properties is reduced for samples with sepiolite. Sisal fibres were embedded in MgO-based cement 

and submitted to longer accelerated ageing curing and no signs of damage were perceived on the 

fibres. While sisal fibres in Portland show symthoms of degradation (cracking of the cells, breakage 

of the linking cell tissues and CaCaO3 depositions), fibres in MgO-SiO2 cement preserve their 

integrity and both their cellulose content and crystallinity. 

5.2 BLOCK 1 

In systems where MgO and SiO2 are mixed with water, the hydration products obtained are 

Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels for all  the formulations studied regardless of age (7 and 28 days). From TG 

tests on samples 100% Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels is possible to determine the amount of Mg(OH)2 in 

the blended samples, whereas the mass loss produced between 300 and 550oC in blended samples 

is due to the dehydroxylation of Mg(OH)2. So it is noted that for formulations with higher MgO 

content higher content of Mg(OH)2 is obtained as hydration product. 



141 
 

 

EDS results indicate that the M-S-H gels obtained both at 7 and 28 days have a Mg/Si ratio 

gain with increasing MgO content. Similarly, for all samples the Mg/Si ratio increases over time, 

which can be interpreted as a change in the gel structure over time because the reaction is still not 

complete after 28 days. This can also be detected by SEM studies, where particles of Mg(OH)2 are 

surrounded by areas of high concentration of Si, which is interpreted as a region where there has 

been a great dissolution of SiO2 to form [Si(OH)4]. This in turn facilitates the dissociation Mg2+ and 

(OH)-, promoting the formation of laminar structures of silicates which subsequently form part of 

the structure of the MSH gels. Also FTIR spectra obtained for all samples exhibit a strong 

resemblance to the spectra corresponding to the layered hydroxides which are similar to chain and 

laminar silicates, as well as the basic units forming the structures of layered double hydroxide 

minerals.  

Despite initially pursuing the maximum content of M-S-H gels in samples in order to achieve 

the maximum mechanical performance, it is observed that this does not necessarily increase 

mechanical performance of the samples. Conversely, at 7 days there is a correlation between the 

content of Mg(OH)2 and the compressive strength of the samples, indicating that the mechanical 

properties are not influenced exclusively by the M-S-H gel content. This is corroborated even at 28 

days wherein the formulation with highest mechanical strength is not the one with a highest M-S-H 

gel content. There seems to be a clear correlation between the amount of pores associated with the 

free presence in the matrix after the hydration reactions, and the compressive strength. 

In view of the results of pH tests, samples with less MgO content have lower values. 

According to compression tests, the formulations 60% MgO-40% SiO2 and 70% MgO-30% SiO2 have 

the highest values at 28 days, with no statiscal difference. 60% MgO-40% SiO2 is chosen as optimal 

for the development of fibre-cement composites since is the most mechanical resistant and is less 

alkaline compared with 70% MgO-30% SiO2. 

 

5.3 BLOCK 2 

The use of Magnesia-Silica (MgO-SiO2) cement is presented as an excellent solution to 

produce fibre-cement products reinforcement exclusively with lignocellulosic fibres since this new 

type of binder preserves cellulosic fibres integrity after ageing, so composites made out of MgO-



142 
 

 

SiO2 exhibit significant higher properties after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing than Portland cement 

composites. According to flexural tests MgO-SiO2 fibre-cement composites: 

Increase or maintain Modulus of Rupture, Limit of Proportionality and Modulus of Elasticity 

values after 200 cycles of accelerated ageing for both types of reinforcement (pine and eucalyptus 

fibres), contrarily to what happens for Portland cement samples that suffer a significant loss on 

Modulus of Rupture after ageing. 

Present the highest values of Specific Energy and Specific Deflection for both types of 

reinforcement at the two tested ages. The preservation of the Specific Energy after 200 aac of the 

MgO-SiO2 samples reinforced with eucalyptus pulp is remarkable, while PC samples drastically loss 

their initial toughness. 

Offer better properties when reinforced with eucalyptus fibres rather than samples with 

pine fibres. This can be associated to the reduced water retention of the eucalyptus pulps during 

molding process, allowing lower water to binder ratio and thus a less porous matrix. Another factor 

to explain the best mechanical performance of the samples reinforced with eucalyptus is their 

shorter length and width, thus obtaining a higher number of reinforcing elements by mass. Hence, 

a more homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement is achieved. 

In addition, with the aid of the SEM images, the preservation of the cellulosic fibres is 

confirmed and flexural performance is explained when reinforcing MgO-SiO2 matrices, observing 

that: 

No significant evidences of mineralization are observed, as occurs with PC samples that 

suffer lumen mineralization (eucalyptus fibres) and fibre-matrix interface mineralization (pine 

fibres), suggesting that no apparent damage is caused to the fibres. 

A better fibre-matrix adherence is produced due to a matrix densification result of an 

ongoing hydration reaction. This evolution of the hydration reaction also helps to improve the 

composite rigidity and physical properties since a significant reduction of the water absorption and 

apparent porosity is achieved after accelerated ageing. 

Better distribution of eucalyptus fibres in comparison to pine fibres, reducing the 

unreinforced regions within the matrix and therefore resulting in a better mechanical performance. 



143 
 

 

In view of all the experimental results, the use of MgO-SiO2 is presented as a suitable 

alternative to cementitious products reinforced with cellulosic pulps with potential application in 

civil construction in view of acceptable performance under binding solicitations and since no 

appreciable degradation of the fibres takes places after 200 soak &amp;amp; dry accelerated ageing cycles.    

 

5.4 BLOCK 3 

According to XRD results, for uncarbonated samples, Mg(OH)2 and M-S-H gels are present 

in the samples before and after ageing, remaining as the main hydration products. However, for 

carbonated samples, Mg(OH)2 peaks are clearly lowered, arising new peaks matching 

hydromagnesite[Mg5(CO3)4·(OH)2·4H2O]. Another particular feature for carbonated samples is the 

reduction of the humps corresponding to M-S-H gel, suggesting that this phase is also carbonated. 

These effects of carbonation may be extended even after carbonation curing conditions are present, 

when samples are submitted to high temperatures (60oC). 

From TG curves, it is possible to observe the effectiveness of carbonation curing since 

samples submitted to carbonation present a higher mass loss due to the decomposition of 

carbonated products. From DTG curves, two specific peaks centred at around 260 and 520oC are 

present for carbonated samples, matching the dehydroxylation and decarbonation of 

hydromagnesite, main product obtained from carbonation curing process. These two peaks remain 

for carbonated samples after accelerated ageing cycles, confirming the thermodynamic stability of 

the carbonated phases over time. Another effect of carbonation is the dislocation of the peaks that 

are centred at around 110 and 410oC when non-carbonation curing is applied. Thus, this 

displacement may be attributed to carbonation of brucite and M-S-H respectively.  

Furthermore, SEM confirms the presence of hydromagnesite crystals when carbonation 

curing is applied as well as different crystalline phases not noticed for uncarbonated samples that 

can be associated to the carbonation of the M-S-H gel in the paste. This process of carbonation may 

produce modify the chemical composition of MgO-SiO2-H2O systems to form compounds with a 

sepiloite-like composition. 

Regarding flexural performance, excellent strength is achieved, with values over 12 MPa, 

confirming the suitability of both cement and polypropylene fibres to produce apt fibre-cement 



144 
 

 

products. Besides, extraordinary toughness performance is attained, with specific energy values 

over 7.5 kJ/m2.  Carbonation affects positively to mechanical strength and physical properties with 

no deleterious effects after ageing since it increases matrix rigidity. These flexural values are higher 

than those reported on the literature where polypropylene fibres are unable to offer a good 

reinforcement effect due to its low density that generates a poor distribution within the matrix and 

the possible formation of clamps. An increment in the amount of cellulosic reinforcement would 

help to resist higher flexural loads without decreasing the toughness of the composites. 

 

5.5 BLOCK 4 

Sepiolite addition increases MOE of hydrated MgO-SiO2 pastes regardless sepiolite type and 

replacement amount. The lower the sepiolite replacement the higher elastic modulus. Since most 

of the formulations do not affect the MgO-SiO2-H2O system reactivity, this improvement in MOE is 

related to a better interlinking between hydrated particles created by sepiolite particles. When 

sepiolite addition improves the formation of more M-S-H gel, it is also associated to a higher specific 

surface of this type of sepiolite (PANGEL). This also affect to the water retention of the samples and 

therefore it can be concluded that the presence of more hydrated compounds is a consequence of 

a higher amount of water within the system. 

Regarding flocculation, the addition of sepiolite to MgO-SiO2 systems increases the floc size 

of the fibre-cement suspensions in an aqueous liquid compared to PC samples. This improves the 

DPM process in terms of fines retention. The higher fines retention would be a very positive effect 

in an upscaled production process due to the reduced amount of tiny particles susceptible of being 

stack and block industrial machinery.  

The introduction of sepiolite in suspensions where both cement and fibres are dispersed 

hampers water removal in MgO-SiO2 systems compared to PC systems. However the addition of 

sepiolite increases drainage speed, this is that most of the water is removed faster than in samples 

containing PC. Once again, this factor would suppose an advantage in a larger production scale since 

it makes more efficient the DPM process with regard to energy saving in the dewatering step. 

Samples with higher specific surface sepiolite retain more water than those with lower specific 

surface. This phenomenon is also reported for hydrated pastes. 



145 
 

 

Since sepiolite induces a higher water retention with no reactive effect, it decreases flexural 

and physical performances of the FRCC. Nevertheless, this increase in retain water may be 

counterbalanced with the interlocking effect of the sepiolite particles that can improve flexural 

performance and physical properties when dosed in reduced amounts (1%). This is very important 

since it allows the combination with carbonation curing techniques since the greater amount of 

water in the samples enhances the carbonation process in Mg-based cements. 

The most interesting effect of adding sepiolite into FRCC with MgO-SiO2 systems is the 

increase of the composite homogeneity. This is specially remarkable in the case of physical 

properties, which is undeniably desired as it makes possible the achievement of a more reliable 

material. It would also be important to optimise this type of composites in the future, since the use 

of sepiolite would reduce the amount of material to obtain reliable test results. 

 

5.6 BLOCK 5 

Thermal tests reveal that sisal fibres, even after 400 accelerated ageing cycles do not suffer 

a significant reduction in cellulose content when exposed to MgO-SiO2 cement. The mass loss 

reported is in accordance with alkali treatments applied for polymeric composites applications, 

where amorphous fractions are undesired. In addition, from thermal tests, activation energy and 

enthalpy is well preserved for fibres in MgO-SiO2 regardless ageing treatment.  

From XRD tests is deduced that cellulose crystallinity and crystallite size is well preserved 

and slightly increased due to the removal of amorphous compounds of the fibres. This is in contrast 

with samples embedded in PC, which after 400aac it is noticed a little decrease of crystallinity due 

to the chemical degradation of cellulose. Besides, samples in MgO-SiO2 do not present extra peaks 

in their respective diffractograms corresponding to compounds migrated from cement hydration. 

This suggests that no mineralization is produced. 

According to SEM techniques, it is possible to see the integrity of the whole fibre with no 

detachment between microfibres neither after 5 months nor after 400aac when submitted to MgO-

SiO2 environment. In addition to the intact aspect of the cross section of the fibres, it is displayed 

after 400aac that compounds from cement hydration, in spite of no penetrating to the inner parts 

of the fibres, are perfectly bonded to the surface thereof. Besides, this cement compounds are both 



146 
 

 

Mg and Si rich, which suggests that not only Mg(OH)2 is formed in the surrounding of the fibres. This 

is an important aspect since it assures the presence of strong phases in the ITZ, which could promote 

a good adherence between fibre and matrix when sisal fibres are applied in this type of FRCC.

6 POSSIBLE FUTURE WORKS 

This thesis is an introduction of lower-alkalinity Mg-based FRCC with lignocellulosic fibres. 

In view of the efficiency of this type of cement for preserving composites performance over time, it 

seems possible to develop a new technology for the production of cementitious materials totally 

reinforced with cellulose-based materials. However, this work is an initial contact with several 

limitations. Consequently, a sequence of further research has to be performed in order to evaluate 

the authentic possibilities of this new technique. Several studies are exposed to give a continuity to 

the present study: 

? Evaluation of the dimensional stability of the exposed composites with the optimization 

techniques explored in previous chapters implemented separately or combined.  

? Study at longer times and under different ageing conditions of the hydration evolution with 

complimentary techniques to the methods used in this work. 

? Analysis of the Interface Transition Zone to understand properly the phenomena in this 

region of the composites and to assess the adherence between lignocellulosic fibres and 

Mg-based cement. 

? Study of the structure of the M-S-H gels and evaluation of methods to improve flowability 

thereof to adopt different moulding procedures. 

? Evaluation of different FRCC moulding techniques, assessment of their technical properties 

and establishment of possible alternative applications for these building materials. 

? Study of the introduction of alternative pozzolans to the system as a source of amorphous 

SiO2 to replace the use of silica fume by agricultural ashes. The use of pozzolans has been 

successfully applied and standardised in PC applications. Pozzolan use would contribute to 

the settlement of new industries in rural areas. 

? Exploring Novacem route to produce MgO-SiO2-H2O systems since this cement would 

result in a great opportunity to reduce the cost of reinforcing elements of the current 

construction industry. Nowadays, Novacem technology and Intellectual Property belongs to 

Calix, an Australian chemical company that is currently heading the vanguard of CO2 intake 

in materials. The development of this knowledge would be an opportunity to for new 

entrepreneurship.  

? Life Cycle Assessment of this technology compared to different alternatives and the current 

FRCC used in the construction industry.
