SUMMARY

Citrus plants are the most important fruit species in the world, with emphasis

to oranges, mandarins and lemons. In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, most fruit

production is found on small properties under organic cultivation. Soil compaction

is one of the factors limiting production and due to the fixed row placement of this

crop, compaction can arise in various manners in the interrows of the orchard.

The aim of this study was to evaluate soil physical properties and water infiltration

capacity in response to interrow management in an orchard of mandarin (Citrus

deliciosa Tenore ‘Montenegrina’) under organic cultivation. Interrow management

was performed through harrowing, logs in "V", mowing, and cutting/knocking down

plants with a knife roller. Soil physical properties were evaluated in the wheel

tracks of the tractor (WT), between the wheel tracks (BWT), and in the area under

the line projection of the canopy (CLP), with undisturbed soil samples collected in

the 0.00-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45, and 0.45-0.60 m layers, with four replicates. The

soil water infiltration test was performed using the concentric cylinder method,

with a maximum time of 90 min for each test. In general, soil analysis showed a

variation in the physical-hydraulic properties of the Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo

distrófico arênico (sandy loam Typic Paleudalf) in the three sampling sites in all

layers, regardless of the management procedure in the interrows. Machinery traffic

leads to heterogeneity in the soil physical-hydraulic properties in the interrows of

the orchard. Soil porosity and bulk density are affected especially in the wheel

tracks of the tractor (WT), which causes a reduction in the constant rate of

infiltration and in the accumulated infiltration of water in this sampling site. The

use of the disk harrow and mower leads to greater harmful effects on the soil,

which can interfere with mandarin production.

RESUMO: ATRIBUTOS FÍSICO-HÍDRICOS DE UM ARGISSOLO VERMELHO-
AMARELO DISTRÓFICO ARÊNICO SOB CULTIVO ORGÂNICO DE
TANGERINEIRAS MONTENEGRINA

As plantas cítricas são as espécies frutíferas de maior importância mundial, com destaque
para as laranjeiras, tangerineiras e limoeiros. No Rio Grande do Sul, a maior parte da
produção do fruto é realizada em pequenas propriedades, sob produção orgânica. A compactação
do solo é um dos fatores limitantes na produção que, em razão do espaçamento fixo da planta,
pode apresenta-se de forma variada nas entrelinhas do pomar. Este estudo teve por objetivo
avaliar os atributos físicos e a capacidade de infiltração de água no solo, em resposta ao
manejo das entrelinhas de um pomar de tangerinas (Citrus deliciosa Tenore) cv. ‘Montenegrina’
sob cultivo orgânico. Os manejos foram realizados por meio de gradagem, arraste de tronco em
“V”, roçada e acamamento com rolo-faca. Os atributos físicos do solo foram avaliados na
linha de tráfego do rodado do trator (R), na entrelinha de tráfego dos rodados do trator (ER) e
sob a linha de projeção da copa (LPC), com amostras indeformadas coletadas nas camadas de
0,00-0,15; 0,15-0,30; 0,30-0,45; e 0,45-0,60 m e quatro repetições. A infiltração de água no
solo foi realizada com cilindros duplos concêntricos, com tempo máximo de 90 min para cada
ensaio. A análise do solo apresentou, de modo geral, variação nos atributos físico-hídricos do
Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo distrófico arênico, nos três locais de amostragem, em todas as
profundidades e independentemente do manejo realizado nas entrelinhas do pomar de
tangerineiras. O tráfego de máquinas promoveu heterogeneidade nos atributos físico-hídricos
das entrelinhas do pomar. A porosidade e a densidade do solo foram influenciadas
principalmente na linha de tráfego dos rodados do trator (R), que gerou redução na taxa
constante de infiltração e na infiltração acumulada de água nesse local de amostragem. O uso
de grade de disco e o de roçadeira promoveram maiores efeitos deletérios no solo, o que pode
interferir na produção das tangerineiras.

INTRODUCTION

Citrus crops are the most important fruit species
in the world, with emphasis to oranges, mandarins
and lemons. Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, is the third
largest producer in the national ranking (FAO, 2009),
with the Caí Valley as its largest production region,
where the ‘Montenegrina’ variety prevails
(Montenegro, 2013).

C i t r u s  p r o d u c t i o n  i n  t h e  C a í  V a l l e y  i s
concentrated on small properties, under organic and
biodynamic growing. The latter, although based on
the same principles and techniques of organic
agriculture, has some particular features, such as
spiritual issues related to anthroposophy, the use
of biodynamic preparations. and astrological
calendars (IBD, 2009).

The activities performed in citrus orchards in Rio
Grande do Sul involve weed control, fertilization,
pruning, fruit thinning, plant health measures, and
harvest. Most of them are performed with the aid of

farm equipment and some orchards are subject to as
many as 300 passes of this equipment between plant
rows throughout their existence.

Richart et al. (2005) claim that farm equipment
traffic is considered to be the main cause of soil
compaction between plant rows in Brazilian orchards.
According to Servadio et al. (2005), deliberate use of
machines in citrus orchards leads to reduction in
macropore volume (pores &gt; 0.05 µm), whereas
micropore volume (pores &amp;lt;0.05 µm) remains
unchanged, affecting total soil porosity. Li et al. (2007)
claim that this change in soil porosity reduces water
infiltration capacity and soil water storage. In this
context, an understanding of water infiltration
capacity and its relation to soil physical properties
is essential for efficient soil and water management
in agricultural production (Reichardt &amp;amp; Timm,
2004).

Since mandarin is a perennial crop with fixed
spacing between plant rows, the tractor tracks in
these orchards are always in the same position. That

causes a soil-tire contact “exclusive zone”, creating
heterogeneity in the soil physical-hydraulic properties
in the interrows of the orchards. Soil samplings were
performed in the wheel tracks and between the wheel
tracks in order to identify possible physical-hydraulic
restrictions to development of citrus crops in Brazilian
orchards (Fidalski et al., 2007).

Based on the above, the aim of this study was to
evaluate soil physical-hydraulic properties in response
to interrow management in a ‘Montenegrina’
mandarin orchard under organic growing. The
hypothesis is that the interrow management in citrus
orchards leads to heterogeneity in soil compaction in
areas under the wheel tracks of the machinery and
outside the area of these tracks, impairing soil water
dynamics.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The experiment was carried out in an organic
orchard of mandarin (Citrus deliciosa Tenore
‘Montenegrina’), located in the physiographic region
of the Depressão Central of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
The climate of the area is Cfa - humid subtropical,
with average temperature near 25 oC, average annual
rainfall of 1,440 mm (Bergamaschi et al., 2003), and
slope from 0.08 to 0.12 m m-1.

The soil of the area was classified as sandy loam
Typic Paleudalf, according to Soil Survey Staff (2010),
with 0.86,0.83, 0.84, and 0.78 kg dm-3 of sand in the
0.00-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45, and 0.45-0.60 m soil
layers, respectively, according to the results obtained
through the pipette method (Embrapa, 2011), There
was predominance of medium and fine sand fractions,
and particle density ranging from 2.54 to 2.55 kg dm-3
(Table 1), determined using the volumetric flask
method (Embrapa, 2011). This is within the proper
limits for sandy soils (2.30 to 2.90 kg dm-3), according
to Libardi (2005).

The orchard was planted in 1990 in a conventional
management system, with seedlings placed at 3.0 m
between plants and 6.5 m between rows in 234 m2

plots, consisting of three rows of five plants each for a
total of 15 plants per plot. The three central rows were
considered as the useful plot area and a border row
separated the treatments.

The area was converted to an organic system in
1998, and then to a biodynamic system in 2009.
Fertilizations were performed in biannual intervals,
with the application of 30 m3 ha-1 of solid compound
and 30 m3 ha-1 of liquid biofertilizers prepared using
citrus bagasse and the bark of acacia (Acacia
mearnsii), provided by the cooperative Ecocitrus,
bringing about soil organic matter (OM) content of 50
and 20 % in the 0.00-0.15 and 0.15-0.30 m surface
layers, respectively (Table 1), according to the
Walkley-Black method (Tedesco et al., 1995).

In the orchard interrows, there is rather diverse
plant cover, with predominance of the species
Synedrellopsis grisebachii Hieron, Acanthospermum
hispidum DC, Ipoema cairica (L.) Sweet, Brachiaria
plantaginea (Link), Cyperus rotundus L., and
Lollium multiflorum Lam.

The treatments for weed control between plant rows
were: T1 - Harrow: partial incorporation of spontaneous
vegetation into the soil at approximately 0.10-0.15 m
using a leveling harrow together with 20 1.7-m-wide
disks, in September, December, and March and
weeding or mowing under the citrus canopy; T2 - Logs
in “V”: knocking down spontaneous vegetation at the
end of its cycle or when taller than 60 cm by dragging
two log segments arranged in a “V” shape, each of 30
to 40 cm diameter, using a device for attachment to
the three-point hitch of the tractor; T3 - Mower:
mechanical cutting of spontaneous vegetation using
a 2.15-m-long, 1.7-m-wide mower pulled by a tractor
when vegetation was taller than 60 cm, and manual
mowing in the interrows (September, December, and
March); and T4 - Knife roller: knocking down
spontaneous vegetation in the interrows using a 2-m-
wide knife roller pulled by a tractor when vegetation
was taller than 60 cm, and manual mowing in the
area under the citrus canopy.

Each plot was managed with one tractor pass in
the interrows. Implements were pulled by a Yanmar
1055 tractor (55HP/2WD), weighing 1,985 kg. Sets of

18.4-30R1 and 14.9-24R1 diagonal tires were used on
the tractor for rear and front axles, respectively.

Analyses of the soil physical-hydraulic properties
were performed from July 2012 to February 2013.
Evaluations were performed in soil samples collected
at three different sites in the interrows: BWT (between
the wheel tracks), WT (in the wheel tracks) and CPL
(under the projection of the canopy), with four
replicates per treatment (T1, T2, T3, and T4). Soil
bulk density (BD) was determined through the
volumetric ring method (Embrapa, 2011), with
undisturbed soil samples collected in the 0.00-0.15,
0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45, and 0.45-0.60 m layers, using
sharp-edged volumetric rings with a height of 5.0 cm,
diameter of 8.5 cm, and volume of 283 cm3.

The same sample was used to determine
macroporosity (Ma), through the tension-table method,
with a 60.0-cm water column to remove water from
the samples through suction until they stopped
draining (approximately 48 h); microporosity (Mi),
when samples were weighed again after the tension
table, remaining in an oven at 105 ºC until constant
weight, i.e., 48 h after the beginning of drying; and
total soil porosity (TP), which was obtained by the
sum of soil macro- and microporosity, according to
Embrapa (2011).

Statistical analyses for soil density, macroporosity,
microporosity, and total porosity were performed
according to the split-plot design, using the software
Statistical Analysis System (SAS), through analysis
of variance. Whenever the F value was significant,
the mean values of the treatments were compared
using the Tukey test (p&lt;0.05).

The water infiltration rate (f) and accumulated
infiltration (I) were determined using double ring
infiltrometers, both 40 cm in height and 30 and
50 cm of inner and outer diameters, respectively,
according to the method described by Bernardo et al.
(2006). Plant cover and surface roots were removed
before placing the cylinders in order to avoid the
interference of soil cover in water infiltration. This
task was carefully performed using a hoe to avoid
changes in the soil surface.

During the tests, hydraulic load was kept at
approximately 15 cm height inside the inner ring.
Whenever there was a decrease of 5.0 cm in the
hydraulic load, the ring was manually replenished,
and the adjusted height recorded. The maximum time
for each test was 90 min and the results were
expressed according to the average values of
infiltration rate and accumulated infiltration
obtained in each replicate.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In general, soil physical analyses showed a
variation in the physical-hydraulic properties of the

sandy loam Typic Paleudalf for the three sampling
sites in all layers, regardless of the interrow
management applied in the mandarin orchard.

The Ma values in the 0.00-0.15 m layer (Table 2)
were low, especially in the WT of the interrows
managed with log segments in “V” and the mower
(0.06 and 0.10 m3 m-3, respectively). These results
are close to the limiting value for aeration and root
development which, according to Carter (2002), is 0.10
m3 m-3. However, there are crops that require an
aeration volume either higher or lower than this
critical limit (Reinert et al., 2001).

These values, even with high OM content (Table
1), are probably related to the fact that the surface
experiences greater interference from soil
management. In addition, the low Ma values in
interrows managed with the dragging of log
segments in “V” and the mower may be related to
the absence of soil turn-over when these implements
are used, which occurs even briefly in turned soils,
such as in interrows managed with a harrow and
knife roller.

However, the use of soil-turning and cutting
implements (such as the harrow) in citrus orchards
is controversial since, while turning the soil, the disks
produce dust, cut roots, and, depending on the site,
cause erosion (Durigan &amp;amp; Timossi, 2002). Thus, they
are no longer used in many regions.

Consequently, there was a variation in Mi, in all
sampling sites, regardless of the management used,
with the highest values (0.36 m3 m-3) being observed
in the WT (Table 2). Such reorganization of Ma and
Mi in the soil caused a variation in TP; however, most
of the observed results are found around the average
value from 0.30 to 0.60 m3 m-3, mentioned by Hillel
(1980) and Kiehl (1979) as the normal range verified
for most mineral soils.

The highest BD values were found in the interrows
managed with the harrow and mower, especially in
the WT, reaching 1.54 kg dm-3 in both treatments.
Similar BD values for harrow and mower treatments
can be attributed to the fact that the cutting performed
by the mower eliminates shoot apical dominance in
plants, stimulating the growth of sprouts situated on
the interface with the soil and, consequently,
increasing the number of operations with these
implements, which favors soil compaction; while the
use of the harrow promotes cutting and turn-over in
the surface soil layer, which also favors soil compaction
(Alcântara et al., 2000).

The 0.15-0.30 m layer also showed low Ma values,
regardless of the management used (Table 2).
Sampling sites in WT and BWT showed values lower
than and close to the limits for root development and
soil aeration (from 0.08 to 0.11 m3 m-3).

The results found in this study are similar to those
found by Reichardt &amp;amp; Timm (2004) and Libardi (2005)
for most Brazilian orchards (Ma values lower than

0.15 m3 m-3), which are ideal for citrus at the 0.30 m
depth, according to these authors. In addition to the
soil compaction effect, the values found in this study
can also be attributed to the high contents of medium
and fine sand, which, according to Souza (1996),
contribute to pore obstruction, lower water infiltration,
and higher possibility of erosion.

In general, in the three sampling sites, regardless
of the management used, Mi values were considered
as satisfactory for citrus (Table 2). According to
Reichardt &amp;amp; Timm (2004) and Libardi (2005), Mi
values should be between 0.20 and 0.23 m3 m-3,
without interfering in TP, which was between 0.30
and 0.35 m3 m-3 in this study, corroborating the ideal

values for citrus in sandy soils in this same layer
(Reichardt &amp;amp; Timm, 2004; Libardi, 2005).

However, BD was affected by soil management in
the three sampling sites, with values ranging from
1.49 to 1.65 kg dm-3. These values are considered
higher than desirable for sandy soils, which, according
to Durigan &amp;amp; Timossi (2002), should be between 1.25
and 1.40 kg dm-3. These same authors report that,
due to compaction, most soils of Brazilian orchards
show BD values from 1.4 to 1.7 kg dm-3 up to a depth
of 0.30 m.

The 0.30-0.45 m and 0.45-0.60 m layers had
variations in the soil physical properties (Ma, Mi, TP,

and BD), as shown in table 2. However, this variation
did not compromise soil macroporosity, which had
values above the critical limit of 0.10 m3 m-3,
regardless of the sampling site and implement used.
This result can be attributed to the fact that interrow
management and the tire-soil contact pressure do not
affect soil structure in the deeper layers.

The water infiltration rate (f) and the accumulated
infiltration (I) in the orchard interrows were affected
by the compaction resulted from interrow
management. The highest values were observed in
the CPL, in all treatments (Figure 1).

The intensity of machinery traffic, combined with
soil particle-size distribution, with the predominance
of medium and fine sands (Table 1), led to a low water
infiltration rate (f), especially in the WT (f = 2.99,
3.83, 2.98, and 1.15 mm h-1 for harrow, log segments
in “V”, mower, and knife roller, respectively) and in
BWT (f = 6.60, 10.80, 10.63, and 4.34 mm h-1 for
harrow, log segments in “V”, mower, and knife roller,
respectively).

Texture variation throughout the profile (Bernardo
et al., 2006) and the reduction in Ma lead to an
increase in soil density and a decrease in the soil water

infiltration rate (Panachuki et al., 2006), as observed
in this study. Although the tensions exerted by the
tractor wheels propagate mostly vertically in the soil,
part of these tensions also propagate sideways,
affecting the sites between the wheel tracks of the
tractor (Trein, 1995).

Although the CPL site had the highest f values
(f = 13.9, 20.55, 15.52, and 12.62 mm h-1 for harrow,
log segments in “V”, mower, and knife roller,
respectively), they are considered low, since the ideal
water infiltration rate for sandy soils should be between
25 and 250 mm h-1, according to Bernardo et al. (2006).

The highest f values in this study were found in
the interrow managed with the dragging of log
segments in “V” (f = 20.55 mm h-1). This result is
contrary to that found by Pietrzacka (2009) in the
same orchard, in which the highest f values were
found in the area under harrowing management,
because the soil had been recently turned over in the
interrows.

Water infiltration rates in all sampling sites had
high initial values, which later decreased and reached
a constant rate at 90 min of the test, as shown in the
use of the Kostiakov equation. For Libardi (2005),
although it is empiric, the Kostiakov equation is very
useful for irrigation purposes due to its simplicity and
because it is reasonably fitted to a great number of
soils at short time intervals (up to 150 min), in addition
to providing information on the soil water absorption
capacity.

Brandão et al. (2006) explain that, in general, when
soil is turned over, the water infiltration capacity
measured using double rings tends to increase because
of the breakdown of soil structure in the surface layer,
and it is higher in systems with soil management
compared to others with less or no disturbance (Abrão
et al., 1979). However, repeated soil management
procedures can cause soil water infiltration rates lower
than those in areas with no soil management.

In addition, after saturation, turned-over soils are
more prone to surface erosion and transport of
particles and nutrients, which is favored in a Sandy
Loam Typic Paleudalf because of its great amount
of sand particles. Therefore, it is necessary to
maintain control over spontaneous vegetation in the
interrows of the orchard for the purpose of avoiding
soil losses by erosion and reduction in mandarin
yield.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Machinery traffic leads to heterogeneity in soil
physical-hydraulic properties in the interrows of the
orchard.

2. Soil porosity and bulk density are especially
affected in the tractor wheel tracks (WT), which causes

a reduction in the constant infiltration rate and in
the accumulated water infiltration in this sampling
site.

3. The use of a disk harrow and mower leads to
greater harmful effects on soil, which can interfere in
mandarin production.
