ABSTRACT

Striae and furrows found on the upper surfaces of three stratigraphically superposed decimetric beds of late

Paleozoic lodgement tillite of the Itararé Subgroup in the northern Paraná Basin were engraved by ploughing of

clasts and possibly also ice protuberances at the base of the glacier, on unconsolidated to partially consolidated

sediment. Associated features indicate that the rheology of the bed varied from stiff during lodgement to

soft and deformable during ploughing. Poor drainage of meltwater at the glacier-bed interface may have

contributed to lower the strength of sediment to deformation.

The deformed interval was probably generated during a single glacial phase or advance of a glacier grounding

in a marine or lacustrine water body. Changes in the dynamics of the glacier involving slow and fast flow

were correlated respectively with alternation of deposition and erosion. The proposed model is analogous to

that of lodgement till complexes from the Pleistocene of the northern hemisphere. Retreat of the glacier was

probably fast, followed by settling of muds on top of the upper striated and furrowed surface, and progradation

of deltaic sands during post-glacial time.

Key words: glacially striated surfaces, soft sediments, Itararé Subgroup, late Paleozoic.

INTRODUCTION

Surfaces bearing furrows and striae formed on un-

consolidated sediments are relatively common fea-

tures associated with diamictites and other rocks in

pre-Pleistocene glacigenic successions (see Wood-

worth-Lynas and Dowdeswell 1994 for references).

In most localities the surfaces have been interpreted

as resulting from the movement of a glacier across

soft beds, being thus subglacial features. Similar to

hard rock striated pavements, the presence of stri-

ated surfaces is usually taken as one of the best

criteria for assigning a glacial origin to the asso-

ciated beds (Hambrey and Harland 1981, Crowell

1999). Woodworth-Lynas and Dowdeswell (1994)

have pointed that many examples of striated sur-

faces described in the literature correspond to fea-

tures formed by the mechanical scouring of floating

ice on sea or lakebed and offer criteria for distin-

guishing between the two types of structures.

Soft sediment striated beds are herein desig-

nated surfaces, in contrast with hard rock striated

pavements. The adjective striated is applied here in

a broad sense to designate bedding planes bearing

striae (positive and negative elements with relief up

to few millimeters), furrows (negative features) and

ridges (positive features) with relief of more than a

few millimeters, of varied shapes, as well as other

abrasional features.

We describe here an extensive striated surface

formed on top of a diamictite probably represent-

ing a subglacial (lodgement) tillite at the basal part

of the Itararé Subgroup (late Paleozoic), well ex-

posed near São Luiz do Purunã, State of Paraná, on

the southern flank of the Ponta Grossa arch (Paraná

Basin). The locality was first briefly reported by

Assine and Zanotto (1993). Additional field work

in the area (Vesely and Assine 1999, Trosdtorf Jr.

et al. 2003) showed that at least two other strati-

graphically distinct, closely spaced (dm) surfaces

are partially exposed within the tillite. We interpret

the features as of subglacial origin that is, generated

by the repetitive sliding of a glacier on unlithified

sediment.

Our survey of the literature showed that re-

ports on multiple, soft sediment glacially striated

surfaces similar to the ones here described are rel-

atively rare in pre-Pleistocene glacigenic succes-

sions. O’Brien and Christie-Blick (1992), for ex-

ample, described a series of six stratigraphically re-

peated, closely spaced (dm to m) striated surfaces

formed on glacial marine sandstone. The authors

interpret that the striae were cut by the recurrently

grounding glacier on glacial marine outwash. They

assigned the features to a subglacial rather than to a

floating ice origin in view of high consistency of ori-

entations of striae on the different surfaces. Several

intraformational, striated surfaces occurring on top

of diamictite and sandstone of the Buckeye Forma-

tion in the Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica

were reported by Aitchison et al. (1988). Most of

the surfaces are stratigraphically tens to hundreds

of meters apart from each other and are typically

overlain by boulder pavements. Only two surfaces

at the top of the unit are as closely spaced (about

20 cm) as the ones reported here. The striations

were interpreted as due to glacial erosion by Aitchi-

son et al. (1988), but an origin through scouring of

soft sediment by floating ice has been proposed by

Woodworth-Lynas and Dowdeswell (1994).

Other reports are by Rocha-Campos et al.

(1997, 1999), who described multiple, soft sedi-

ment, furrowed and striated surfaces on top of shal-

low marine Proterozoic quartzite, directly overlain

by diamictite of the Jequitai Formation in central

Minas Gerais State, and on sandstone of the Curitu-

ba Formation, Northeastern Brazil, and by Trosdtorf

Jr. et al. (2003), who described multiple striated sur-

faces on late Paleozoic fluvioglacial and glacimarine

sandstones of the Itararé Subgroup (Paraná Basin,

Southern Brazil). Close parallelism of the features

and absence of lateral berms (Woodworth-Lynas and

Dowdeswell 1994) in both localities, plus deforma-

tion of beds underlying the striations in the Paraná

Basin suggest a subglacial origin for the striations

under an oscillating grounded, glacier margin. In

Northeastern Brazil features assigned to scouring by

floating ice appear associated with subglacial stria-

tions (Rocha-Campos et al. 1997, 1999).

Characteristics that distinguish the surfaces at

São Luiz do Purunã from other pre-Pleistocene lo-

calities are their occurrence on closely spaced beds

of lodgement tillite which have similar textures and

clast composition. These aspects may be related

with glacier dynamics as discussed later.

To our knowledge, multiple, glacially striated

surfaces have yet not been found in Pleistocene

or Recent glacial deposits. The only example of an

exceptionally well-preserved single sand bed bear-

ing striae and depositional features formed beneath

a sliding glacier is described by Clark and Hansel

(1989) from the Pleistocene of Illinois. They assign

the preservation of the sand bed to syn-sedimentary

(subglacial) carbonate cementation. Intraforma-

tional, glacially striated surfaces thus do occur in

recent and Pleistocene deposits, but, as a rule, they

do not become easily exposed, and are mostly de-

stroyed by erosion. Striated and furrowed surfaces

described may be equivalent to sharp, planar discon-

tinuities (unconformities) separating multiple, thin

till units described by Eyles et al. (1982) and related

to variation in deposition of lodgement till.

The intrabasinal nature of most of the ancient

glacigenic deposits, on the other hand, implies con-

tinuous subsidence, and accumulation of younger

sediments that may include post-glacial trans-

gressive beds, followed by diagenesis. Subglacially

compacted, striated beds are also often imper-

meable and subject to cementation and hardening

during weathering (Eyles 1993). Several authors

(Savage 1972, Visser and Hall 1984, von Brunn

and Marshall 1989, Visser 1990) have raised the

question of the potential preservation of soft sedi-

ment, striated and grooved surfaces in late Paleo-

zoic glacigenic successions in the context of an ac-

tive glacial environment. This aspect will be briefly

considered later in this paper.

In view of their rarity in the geological record,

exposures of multiple, glacially striated, soft sedi-

ment surfaces offer an insight into subglacial ero-

sional and depositional processes and the behavior

of former glaciers. They provide observations of

interactions of glaciers and unlithified (deformable)

substrata that may have occurred under the Gond-

wana ice sheets.

LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY AND
PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS

The striated surfaces crop out in an ample, horizontal

area, a few meters southwest of the road BR-277, at

km 136, east from São Luiz do Purunã, PR, on the

south flank of the Ponta Grossa arch, Paraná Basin

(Fig. 1).

The Fig. 2 is a schematic stratigraphic section

of the outcrop area. The main striated surface oc-

curs on the top of a 5 m thick, upper, tabular, di-

amictite bed. Two other partially exposed striated

surfaces occur at two different levels, decimeters

apart, within the diamictite. The total area of the

latter two is unknown. Except for these discontinu-

ities, the diamictite seems homogeneous along its

entire thickness.

Strata underlying the diamictite consist of a 10-

15 m thick sequence of interbedded, decimetric lay-

ers of fine, massive sandstone and diamictite. Clasts

(up to 15 cm in diameter) dispersed in the sandstone

may correspond to dropstones. The upper contact

of these beds with the diamictite was not observed.

The Itararé succession rests unconformably on sand-

stone of the Furnas Formation (Devonian).

Bigarella et al. (1967) assigned extensive

glacial striations found on the Devonian Furnas For-

mation, and on thin (decimeters to few meters) red-

dish diamictite and sandstone beds that overly the

Furnas, in the basal Itararé Subgroup exposed on

southern Ponta Grossa arch, to two successive

‘‘glaciations’’, respectively, Rio do Salto and Can-

cela. The direction of movement of glacier in both

cases was northward. Trosdtorf Jr. (unpublished

data) however, related the features to two succes-

sive advances of the late Paleozoic Paraná glacial

lobe.

The diamictite is dark reddish, silty-clayey,

well consolidated, and crudely bedded and includes

rare, thin, discontinuous partings of tightly folded

and faulted, stratified, fine conglomeratic sandstone.

Clasts of varied composition (mainly Precambrian

metamorphic and igneous rocks), angular to well

rounded, ranging in size from pebbles to boulders

(up to 40 cm) are relatively abundant. Striations and

furrows affect the upper 4-10 cm of the diamictite,

corresponding to the depth of the features. Small

planar clast clusters with beveled clasts and isolated,

faceted and striated clasts occur in the lower portion

of the diamictite bed. These features are described in

detail below. The above set of characteristics seems

compatible with the interpretation of the diamictite

as a subglacial (lodgement) tillite.

Beds above the diamictite comprise two

coarsening-thickening upward cycles, each around

10 m thick, of fine to coarse sandstone and

interbedded mudstone (Figs. 2 and 3). The main

striated surface is directly overlain by a lower, up

to 3 m thick mudstone layer. Mudstone intercala-

tions become thinner toward the upper part of each

cycle where amalgamated beds of sandstone pre-

dominate. Sigmoidal cross-bedding, climbing rip-

ple cross-lamination, load and soft-sediment defor-

mation are frequent in the sandstone. Dropstones

seem to be absent in beds above the diamictite.

Paleocurrents in the sandstone flowed in average

toward west (Fig. 2), normal to the local sense of

movement of glacier. We interpret this part of the

section as made up of deltaic sands intercalate with

prodeltaic muds.

The lithofacies succession in the upper part of

the section examined at São Luiz do Purunã (Fig. 2)

seems thus to record several episodes of subglacial

deposition of layers of lodgement tillite subse-

quently furrowed and striated. These are possibly

related to phases of slow or fast ice flow respectively

(Bennett and Glasser 1997). Final retreat of the

glacier was accompanied by accumulation of sub-

aquatic muds and progradational deltaic sands.

A question that arises at the studied outcrop

is whether the glacier that deposited the lodgement

tillite and produced the striations moved in a glacial

terrestrial environment, post-glacially flooded by a

water body, or whether it reached the margin,

and entered grounded into an already existing lacus-

trine or marine basin. Occurrence of extensive stri-

ated pavements or surfaces in pre-Pleistocene suc-

cessions has often been taken as indicative of glacial

terrestrial setting (e.g. Bigarella et al. 1967, Sav-

age 1972, von Brunn and Marshall 1989). Acoustic

imaging of glaciated continental margins (Davies

et al. 1997), shows a profusion of subglacial fea-

tures (lineations, drumlins, flutes, glaciotectonic),

that demonstrates that subglacial processes continue

under grounded ice. These are, however, megascale

features. Features of the dimensions of the ones de-

scribed here are probably below the resolution of

acoustic methods.

The Itararé Subgroup beds examined are not

fossiliferous, and thus the paleoenvironment of the

rocks has to be interpreted on the basis of lithofacies

characteristics and distribution in analogous recent

glacial environments.

GLACIALLY STRIATED, SOFT SEDIMENT SURFACES 371

Fig. 2 – Stratigraphic section of basal Itararé Subgroup beds at São Luiz do Purunã, PR.

The diamictite bearing the striated surfaces is

intercalated between beds of probable subaquatic

facies (stratified sandstone below and laminated

mudstone above) in the outcrop studied (Fig. 2).

This facies relation suggests a probable penecon-

temporaneity in the deposition of striated diamicton,

muds and sands. Other features that are considered

as characteristic of gravity-driven deformation that

commonly occur associated with proglacial sub-

aqueous beds (Eyles 1993) are missing.

Geological preservation of the extensive upper

surface would probably be more prone to occur sub-

aquatically. Reimnitz and Barnes (1974) comment

that floating ice scours cut in marine beds are often

modified and smoothed by bottom currents unless

protected by deposition of fine sediments.

Fig. 3 – Deltaic sandstone and mudstone overlying the diamictite. Contact marked by white line.

We thus envisage the paleoenvironmental set-

ting at the present locality as corresponding to a wa-

ter body (lacustrine/ marine) into which the glacier

advanced grounded. In analogy with sedimentary

processes described by Powell (1983) in glacial-

stuarine environment, a combination of fast retreat

of the glacier margin to a position away from the

water associated with rising sea level, and lateral

changes in the site of deposition in the basin could

have resulted in the accumulation of fine-grained

sediments (mud drape) over furrowed and striated

till. Absence of dropstones in the beds above the

diamictite may indicate that the glacier had lost con-

tact with the water and/or no calving of bergs was

happening or even that they were moving rapidly

away (Everhoi et al. 1980, Molnia 1983). We may

speculate that progradation of the outwash delta was

triggered by post-glacial isostatic uplift of the basin

margin. Coarse glaciclastic deposits (subaqueous

outwash) that could indicate ice contact however

were not found. Alternatively, deposition of the

deltaic package may represent a later event when

marine processes were dominant and glacial influ-

ence was minimum.

Lithofacies succession in the studied outcrop

can be compared to fourth/ fifth order cycles inserted

in the third order sequences described in the Itararé

Subgroup and interpreted as glacio-eu-isostatically

controlled (Canuto et al. 2001).

STRIATED SURFACES

The following description is mainly based on the

uppermost and better exposed striated surface at

São Luiz do Purunã (Fig. 2). The lower ones are

of limited exposure and presumably less extensive.

The surface crops out almost continuously over

an area of at least 40 m by 30 m (1,200 m2) being

covered by striae, furrows and ridges, essentially

rectilinear and parallel, oriented in average around

N2? (Fig. 4A). Individual larger furrows and ridges
may reach at least 11 m in length. Width of fur-

rows is somewhat irregular due to the textural het-

erogeneity of the excavated diamicton, and range

from centimeters to around 55 cm. Their section

varies from shallow ‘‘U’’-shaped (wider furrows)

to ‘‘V’’-shaped (narrower furrows) with depths up

to 10 cm. Ridges between furrows, decimetric (30-

55 cm) up to 1.5 m wide, have also low, inverted

‘‘U’’-shaped section with flat tops or more rounded

section (Fig. 4B).

Striae and small furrows occur inside larger

furrows and on ridges. Striations may be narrow

and shallow at one or both ends; some have ac-

cumulated ridges or prows of sediment at one end

(Figs. 4A and B). The glacial features are intersected

by several differently oriented groups of parallel fur-

rows, artificially excavated during road construction

(Fig. 4A). The former can be easily distinguished

by being isoriented and internally striated. Orien-

tations of features on the lower surfaces differ only

slightly from those on the main one, but are less well

preserved.

A series of other features of the striated sur-

faces confirm their soft-sediment nature and give

indication on subglacial processes associated with

the generation of the striae. They are:

a) Slumped diamicton. Small, flap-like layers of

diamictite cover striae inside furrows. They

obviously represent masses of diamicton that

flowed down from adjacent ridges (Fig. 4C).

b) Sediment prows. Concentric, curved ridges of

diamictite around one end of clasts suggesting

that sediment has been pushed in front of them

when being ploughed into the underlying di-

amicton and finally lodged (Fig. 5A). Isolated

prows may have been produced by the same

mechanism, though not associated with lodge-

ment of the ploughing clasts. Some prows may

have been produced by ice protuberances

under the sliding glacier.

c) Curved, oblique furrows. A few smaller fur-

rows are curved and are oblique to the main ori-

entation of features on the surface. These may

be formed by rotation and change in the trajec-

tory of a moving clast or by a clast with an irreg-

ular keel (Clark and Hansel 1989). (Fig. 5B.)

d) Linear accumulation of sediment in the shadow

of clasts. One example of small, dm long fea-

ture found inside a curved furrow may repre-

sent a type of crag and tail feature (Fig. 5B).

Larger ridges of diamictite, up to 55 cm wide,

about 15 cm high and several meters long, with

flat, striated tops, found on the lee side of boul-

ders are remindful of flutes (Fig. 4B). Similar

features in front of Turtman Glacier (Switzer-

land) have been called miniflutes and assigned

to seasonal advances of the debris-free glacier

on pre-deposited till by van der Meer (1997).

Association of striations with evidence of

lodgement at São Luiz do Purunã is more sug-

gestive of an origin predominantly through the

ploughing action of subglacial clasts. Relative

abundance of clasts in the diamictite at the out-

crop studied suggests that they were an impor-

tant component in the basal debris zone of the

glacier;

e) Embedded clasts. Clasts transported at the base

of the glacier ploughed the soft till until they

became firmly anchored in it when frictional

resistance of the sediment exceeded the drag

imposed by the sliding glacier (Boulton 1979).

Contrasting with these, features in the lower

zone of the diamictite seem to point to stiffer con-

ditions in the till. These are planar clusters of clasts

with beveled tops and clasts with faceted and

striated tops not associated with prows that appear

immersed in the diamictite matrix on the bottom of

furrows. We consider that truncation of resistant

rocks by the glacier would only be possible if the

clasts were embedded in a stiff, non-deformable bed.

Clusters of clasts are tightly packed and have

their long axes trending N20?, being thus roughly
parallel with the general orientation of furrows and

striae. They could correspond to a type of sub-

glacial boulder pavement (Fig. 5C).

Sediments prows and linear concentrations

of sediment allow the interpretation of the sense of

movement of the glacier in the area that was toward

north, coinciding with the general trend of late Pa-

leozoic ice movement in the southern flank of the

Ponta Grossa arch (Bigarella et al. 1967).

ORIGIN OF THE SURFACES

Furrows and striae on the studied surface have been

probably excavated into non-lithified bed (till)

mainly by subglacial plowing of the diamicton by

keels of clasts being transported at the sole of a slid-

ing glacier. It is possible that subglacier ice pro-

tuberances also contributed to this process. Strong

parallelism of striations over the large exposed area,

absence of berms and presence of the above-

described features rule out the possibility of origin

by scouring of floating ice.

A similar origin involving ploughing is pro-

posed by Clark and Hansen (1989) for a soft sed-

iment striated surface from the Pleistocene of

Illinois, but developed on glaciofluvial sand. As in

An Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)



GLACIALLY STRIATED, SOFT SEDIMENT SURFACES 375

our case, striations here are associated with sedi-

ment prows, linear grooves and striated clasts that

the authors take as evidence of subglacial lodge-

ment. Clark and Hansen (1989) point out that cur-

rent subglacial depositional models establish that a

‘‘stiff’’ bed on which the englacial debris can be

accreted is a necessary requirement for lodgement

to occur (Boulton 1982, Eyles and Menzies 1986,

Eyles 1993, Bennett and Glasser 1997). They then

propose in the case of the Illinois surface that soft

bed condition could have been generated in

response to strong stress concentration at the

clast-bed contact.

At the Paraná Basin locality, however, the

glacier moved on top of soft silty-clayey diamicton

(Fig. 2). There is no evidence of presence of rel-

atively thick deformed bed produced by pervasive

shear stress (Boulton and Hindmarsh 1987, Alley et

al. 1987). On the contrary, deformation in our case

is usually associated with ploughing clasts, being

restrict to the upper 10-15 cm of the tillite and un-

derlain by a more stiff, less deformable horizon of

lodgement till. Rare shoestring lenses of meltout

sands intercalated in the diamictite may indicate

poor subglacial drainage at the glacier-bed interface,

high pore water pressure and relatively low shear

strength of the till.

Several authors (Beget 1986, Brown et al.

1987, Fischer and Clarke 1994, Tulaczyk 1999,

Tulaczyk et al. 2001) have proposed that plough-

ing of clasts and of ice protuberances at the bot-

tom of ice facilitate fast sliding of a glacier over

deformable sediments. The common occurrence of

soft sediment furrowed and striated surfaces in the

late Paleozoic glacigenic beds of Brazil suggests that

ice sliding by ploughing was a common mechanism

for the displacement of the Gondwana glaciers.

The small linear accumulation of sediments

and flute-like ridges found on the striated surface

suggest that other erosional and depositional sub-

glacial processes may also have been active at São

Luiz do Purunã, involving the flow or deformation of

sediment around obstacles formed by the presence

of a boulder. The first features are also remindful

of hairpin erosional marks assigned to the action of

horseshoe vortices of meltwater around an obstacle

(Shaw 1998). Hairpin marks are, however, entirely

abrasional features that have been reported generally

associated with subglacially hard bedrock. Surface

of flute-like features bear striae indicating that they

were molded in contact with the glacier (Fig. 4B).

Although basal meltwater did probably existed at

the interface between the glacier and the unconsoli-

dated bed, landforms indicative of strong meltwater

action, such as sinuous mega-channels, are missing.

Interpretation of the local succession (Fig. 2)

in terms of glacial stratigraphy presents some dif-

ficulties and a provisional explanation is here ad-

vanced. The apparent rheology of the diamictite, as

discussed above, suggests that each bed of lodge-

ment tillite overlain by the furrowed and striated

surfaces may record transitional episodes of de-

position of subglacial till followed by erosion by

ploughing. These could correspond respectively to

a change from conditions of slow to fast moving ice

(Bennett and Glasser 1997). The tillite beds are of

the same facies both texturally as well as in clast

composition and have been deposited by a glacier

flowing consistently toward north.

In our view, the above circumstances may be

more easily explained if we consider the studied

tillite sequence as resulting from a single glacial

phase or advance, during which changes in the

glacier flow or dynamics took place leading to alter-

nation between subglacial deposition and erosion.

The concept is analogous to the model of lodge-

ment till complex proposed by Eyles et al. (1982)

for Pleistocene lodgement till sequences (lodgement

till complexes) of England. Accordingly, the in-

traformational striated surfaces at São Luiz do Pu-

runã would be equivalent to the sharp planar discon-

tinuities (unconformities) that separate Pleistocene

lodgement till units.

In this context, preservation of the soft sedi-

ment striated surfaces that occur internally in the di-

amictite at São Luiz do Purunã may be explained by

the deposition of a layer of diamicton on top of each

of them. Covering by subaqueous mud would, by

An Acad Bras Cienc (2005) 77 (2)

its turn, protect the uppermost surface from subse-

quent erosion. A similar explanation was advanced

by Trosdtorf Jr. et al. (2001) for the preservation of

other multiple, soft sediment, striated surfaces from

the base of the Itararé Subgroup, in Palmeira, some

30 km west from the present locality.

FINAL REMARKS

Closely spaced, stratigraphically repeated striated

and furrowed surfaces formed on top of late Pale-

ozoic (Itararé Subgroup) beds of lodgement tillite,

well exposed in northern Paraná Basin, Brazil, al-

low examination of subglacial erosional and deposi-

tional features indicative of processes that occurred

in the interface between the Gondwana glacier flow-

ing on soft, deformable bed. The multiple striated

surfaces were generated mostly by ploughing of un-

lithified diamicton by clasts transported at the base

of a warm based glacier on top of lodgement till

beds. The relative fine-grained diamicton and pres-

ence of meltwater probably provided a weak inter-

face between the bed and overlying glacier leading

to limited deformation and possibly fast sliding.

The local tillite stratigraphy records a history

of an advance of a grounded glacier into a water-

filled basin. Variation in the velocity of glacier flow

from slow to fast was associated with deposition

of lower layer of lodgement till and erosion of an

upper soft bed and formation of striated surfaces.

The proposed explanation is analogous to the model

of lodgement till complex discussed by Eyles et al.

(1982). Retreat of the glacier was probably fast,

followed by accumulation of muds on top of till.

Post-glacial history is marked by the progradation

of wedge bodies of deltaic sands into the lacustrine

or marine basin.

Subglacial features associated to multiple stri-

ated surfaces preserved in studied locality are rarely

seen in the geological record and offer a view of pro-

cesses associated with a warm based glacier moving

on a soft and deformable bed, such as plough-

ing. We believe these features in the pre-Pleistocene

record deserve additional study.

RESUMO

Estrias e sulcos encontrados sobre três camadas deci-

métricas, estratigraficamente superpostas, de tilito de alo-

jamento neopaleozóico do Subgrupo Itararé, na porção

norte da Bacia do Paraná, foram formados por aração de

clastos e, possivelmente, por protuberâncias de gelo, na

base da geleira. Feições associadas indicam que a reolo-

gia do sedimento variou de rígido, durante o alojamento,

a inconsolidado e deformável durante a aração. A baixa

drenagem da água de degelo na interface geleira-substrato

pode ter contribuído para reduzir a resistência do sedi-

mento à deformação.

A sucessão acima foi gerada provavelmente durante uma

única fase glacial ou avanço de geleira sobre corpo de

água marinho ou lacustre. Mudanças na dinâmica da

geleira envolvendo fluxos lento e rápido corresponderam,

respectivamente, a alternâncias entre deposição e erosão.

O modelo proposto é análogo ao de complexos de till

de alojamento do Pleistoceno do hemisfério do norte. O

recuo da geleira foi provavelmente rápido, seguido pela

deposição de lama acima da superfície estriada e sulcada

superior, e progradação de ciclos de arenitos deltáicos du-

rante a época pós-glacial.

Palavras-chave: estrias glaciais, sedimentos inconsoli-

dados, Subgrupo Itararé, Neopaleozóico.
