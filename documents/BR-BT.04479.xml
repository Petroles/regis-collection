Abstract
Natural convection in cavities containing fluids with internal heat generation has been investigated in nuclear engineering in order to understand the heat transfer mechanisms in light water reactors (LWRs), after severe accidents with core melt- down. This paper reports computational simulation of natural convection in a square cavity containing a fluid with internal heat generation by using a commercial package of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Ansys CFX 12.0.The work aimed at analyzing the influence of fluid properties and the volumetric heat generation rate in the behavior of the flow regime and heat transfer, based on Prandtl (Pr) and Rayleigh (Ra) numbers. In a square cavity with isothermal vertical and adiabatic horizontal walls, steady laminar, transient laminar and turbulent regimes were identified, for Pr equal to 0.0321, 0.71 and 7.0. The identification of periodic and chaotic transient laminar flow was carried out by spectral analysis of instantaneous velocity and temperature. The critical Rayleigh number.at which transition from steady to transient laminar flow regime occurs was determined. Turbulent natural convection was studied by using Reynolds average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with SST model.

Introduction
Natural convection in fluids with internal heat generation has a significant importance not only for being a classical problem of fluid mechanics but also for having many engineering applications. In nuclear engineering, for example, the study of natural convection is motivated by the severe accident scenario in nuclear power plants, in which a partial or total core meltdown occurs. The TMI accident, in 1979, is a well kno
wn kind of severe accident, with a partial core melting. Another severe accident occurred recently in the Fukushima nuclear power plant, in March 2011.
In last few decades, this physical phenomenon has been analyzed for different purposes: assist in preventing and managing of accidents, prescribe the consequences of the core meltdown and assess the possibility for in-vessel melt strength. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the dy-
namic processes and heat transfer present in the molten core material, which still releases heat from the fission product decay.
The fluid flow behavior in enclosures with a natural convection is governed by two dimensionlessl numbers, the Prandtl number (Pr) and the Rayleigh number (Ra):
v	gBq L5
Pr = — Ra = v	(1)
a	vak
Instead of the Rayleigh numbler, in some studies the Grashof number (Gr) is adopted, which can be related to Rayleigh and Prandtl number as follows:
Pr

Kulacki and Emara (1975) carried out an experimental study of natural convection in a fluid thin layer on an insulated plate, heated by a single top plate. The evaluated Pran-dtl numbers ranged from 2.75 to 6.85 and Rayleigh numbers were higher than 2x1012. The empirical correlation obtained for Nusselt number (Nu) of the cavity upper surface was:
Nut = 0,43Ra0,266	(3)
Several experimental and numerical heat transfer studies have been performed with the approach of natural convection in fluids volumetrically heated, present both in hemisphere and semicircular cavity. Mayinger et al. (1976) obtained Nusselt numbers on the lower and upper surfaces of a semicircular cavity with all isothermic walls both numerically and experimentally. The Prandtl number of the fluid in issue was 7.0 and the Rayleigh number ranged from 107 to 5x1010. The empirical correlations obtained by Mayinger etal. (1976) are as follows:
Nuop = 0,36Raa23	(4)
No	= 0,54Ra0,18	(5)
The influence of the Prandtl number in natural convection was analyzed by Kulacki and Emara (1980), who studied fluids, confined in a rectangular domain, with Pr numbers varying from 0.05 to 20 and Rayleigh numbers in the range of 5x104 and 5x108. Kulacki and Emara (1980) observed the
loss of symmetry and the beginning of periodicity in the Raj equal to 5x106.
The analysis of the temperature difference between the walls of a square cavity was analyzed by Acharya and Goldstein (1983) in a fluid with internal heat generation. The cavity inclination was also analyzed with the external Rae numbers, defined by the equation 6, in the range of 103 to 107 and internal Rayleigh numbers of 0 to 107. Acharya and Goldstein (1983) concluded that the transition from laminar to turbulent regime occurred when Rae was between 0.1 x Rai to the corresponding maximum value of Ra.. Another observation was that the heat rate average along the cold wall increased monotonically with the increase of Rae.

Asfia and Dhir (1996) conducted an experimental study of the influence of the boundary conditions on the natural convection behavior of a fluid in a hemisphere. A small difference in the heat transfer coefficients was found among the outcomes of the cavity with free, insulated and refrigerated surface. The experimental data reported by Asfia and Dhir (1996) showed good agreement with the correlation data provided by Kulacki and Emara (1975).
Some experimental and numerical studies exposed a significant effect of the Prandtl number on heat transfer. As a practical exercise, Nourgaliev etal. (1997) carried out numerical analysis to investigate this effect on fluids with internal heat generation. The analysis was based on Prandtl numbers equal to 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 1.4 and 7.0 in a range of Rayleigh numbers from 106 to 1012. Nourgaliev etal. (1997) concluded that in a square cavity, for Ra greater than 1011, the turbulence model became necessary and that the transition from laminar to turbulent regimes occurred between Ra equal to 5x1011 and 1013. Another observation was that the effect of the Pr number on heat transfer was more significant in the stably stratified bottom parts of enclosures and it grew along with the increasing Rayleigh number.
Arcidiacono et al. (2001) studied two-dimensional natural convection of a fluid with a Prandtl number equal to 0.0321 (characteristic of a lithium-lead alloy at 300°C) confined in a square cavity. Arcidiacono et al. (2001) considered
adiabatic upper and lower walls, and isothermal side walls. They analyzed the flow regime behavior (transient and chaotic laminar) by the Grashof number, ranging from 105 to 109. Arcidiacono et al. (2001) observed that for Gr 105 the heat transfer by conduction was prevalent and as Grashof number increased, the asymmetry of the temperature distribution increased. For Gr 5.4x107 a perfect periodic flow was generated, while for Gr 109 the flow became completely chaotic.
The aim of this paper was to analyze natural convection in a volumetrically heated fluid confined in a square cavity, investigating the influence of fluid properties, and especially the internal heat generation rate on the flow regime and heat transfer behavior by the combination of Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers.
Mathematical formulation
We considered two-dimensional turbulent flow and heat transfer in a square cavity due to the buoyancy induced by spatially uniform volumetric heat generation in the fluid. The square cavity has isothermal vertical and adiabatic horizontal walls, as depicted in figure 1.

The fluid is considered to be incompressible with the Boussinesq approximation valid for the buoyancy term in the momentum equation. The thermophysical properties of the fluid are considered to be constant.
The governing Reynolds averaged continuity, momentum and energy equations are written as follows:

The source term Sm in the momentum equation is the buoyant force, which under the Boussinesq approximation is defined by,
SM = (P - Pref )g = B(T - Tref Ü

The Reynolds stress tensor is related to the mean flow deformation through the concept of turbulent viscosity,
(pu®u) = u(VU + (VU)T - % §(pk + ut V.U))	(11)
The turbulent eddy viscosity was modeled by using k-m SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model, with the following governing equations for the energy and turbulent frequency equations,

wing the discretization of momentum and mass balance equations by unstructured grids. All the cases were performed with double precision, high resolution of transient terms and second order implicit Euler for discretization of advection terms.
Results and Discussion
The steady and transient laminar flow regimes were simulated for fluids with Pr numbers equal to 0.0321, 0.71 and 7.0 and Rayleigh numbers ranging from 103 to 109.
The simulations were performed using a 200X200 uniform structured mesh containing 80.420 nodes and 40.000 elements, identified as mesh 2. This mesh was chosen after a grid independence study carried out with three grids (Grid 1 - 100x100 elements, grid 2 - 200x200 elements and grid 3 -400x400 elements), in the case of Pr = 0.7 and Ra =105. The accuracy of the numerical solution was evaluated comparing the dimensionless temperature obtained in a central domain axis, i.e. along y andx = H/2. This location in the domain was chosen because it is where the maximum value of the temperature occurs. The outcome of the mesh sensitivity is shown in figure 2.

The investigation of the most accurate value of critical Rayleigh (Rac) number, in which the transition of the steady to the transient laminar flow occurred, have obtained the Rac numbers equal to 5.88x105, 1.05x109 and 2.5x1012 for Pr numbers, respectively, equal to 0.0321, 0.71 and Pr 7.0.
Figures 3a and 4a show respectively the behavior of vertical component of velocity (v) in the fluid with Pr = 0.0321, for Ra equal to106 and 108. Figures 3b and 4b show respectively the power spectra obtained by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for the same Pr and Ra numbers exposed in figures 3a

and 4a. Note that for Ra = 106 the transient regime behavior can be considered as periodic, since the oscillation frequencies are commensurable. However, for Ra = 108, the spectrum indicates the same fundamental frequency of 0.005hz presented in the spectrum of the Ra = 106 though the frequencies are not commensurable, indicating a transient qua-si-chaotic flow behavior.
Figure 5 shows the variation of heat transfer rate, Nu, (Nu/0), over the side walls of the square cavity with Ra numbers. The numbers of Nu and 0 (dimensionless temperature) are defined respectively as follows,

Where:
qv = volumetric heat generation rate;
H = height of the cavity;
k = thermal conductivity of the fluid.
It was observed for all analyzed Pr numbers that as Rayleigh number increased, the heat transfer also increased. Another observation, it is worth noting here, that, there is an increase of Nu^ numbers as the Pr number raises. This last observation, also obtained by Nourgaliev (1997), is a result of the enhancement on the heat transfer by the increasing Pr number as a consequence of the delay in formation and release of thermals on the side walls.
Conclusion
The grid independence study showed that numerical results by all analyzed grids were in good agreement. The second most refined grid was used in all the simulations performed, because of the lower computational effort.
Based on the computational simulations, it was observed that the critical Rayleigh number for the transition from steady laminar to transient laminar flow regimes increased with Prandtl number. The respective Rac numbers for Pr equal to 0.0321, 0.71 and 7.0 were 5.88x105; 1.05x 109, 2.5x1012.
According to the turbulence analysis performed by the RANS-SST model with Pr 0.0321, it was found that the onset of the turbulence occurred in the Ra = 109. For Pr = 0.71, the turbulence was initially observed in the Ra approximately equal to 1010, whereas it was first observed in Ra = 1013 for Pr = 7.0.
